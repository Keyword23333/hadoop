3910000 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3910001 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3910002 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3910003 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3910004 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3910005 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3910006 who are open to doing something on the production side
3910007 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3910008 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3910009 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3910010 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3910011 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3910012 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3910013 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3910014 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3910015 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3910016 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3910017 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3910018 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3910019 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3910020 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3910021 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3910022 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3910023 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

3910027 en el expediente que nos suministr el secretario de medio ambiente que lleva el 903767 observamos la faltante de documentos fundamentales para una tramitaci n de instalaci n de industrias como lo son las normas exigidas por la ley 6260 y sus decretos reglamentarios por esta raz n el 8 de agosto ingresaron en el organismo copias de las ordenanzas modificatorias del plan de ordenamiento urbano actualmente vigentes el acuerdo 2604 del hcd y el decreto de venta del predio 778 del poder ejecutivo provincial
3910028 en el informe se le hace notar a raffo el desconocimiento de esas ordenanzas vigentes al momento de la venta por parte del arquitecto luis barzan funcionario de la municipalidad de victoria quien en el informe que figura a fojas 52 con fecha 29 de noviembre de 2007 expresa la fracci n de la parcela global incluida en el sector sdc 5 aproximadamente un 36 por ciento del total se encuentra en el rea denominada de reserva donde los usos industriales est n permitidos por la ordenanza 2472 05 ante situaciones an logas la v a de excepci n ante el concejo deliberante ha resultado til encontrando una razonable recepci n por parte del mismo tambi n mencionamos que el expediente no incorpora el decreto 7781 que contiene diferencias sustanciales entre los procesos industriales explicados en el expediente 903767 al cual accedimos recientemente y que rubrica el ingeniero ruben eduardo molinelli
3910029 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3910030 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3910031 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3910032 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3910033 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3910034 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3910035 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3910036 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3910037 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3910043 nos de respuestas respecto de la continuidad de las obras
3910044 sinceramente estoy cansado de hacer el seguimiento y de pelear por estas obras que deber an haber estado concluidas hace a os
3910045 es una pena que no se utilicen estos 80 0 90 kil metros de obra que costaron alrededor de 26 o 27 millones dinero que se ha invertido y a n as no se pueden usar
3910046 por la cantidad de tr nsito que bordea la ciudad la enorme cantidad de camiones que acceden a diario y la inseguridad en los colectivos y para toda la poblaci n es una injusticia que se dilapide esta important sima inversi n es dinero del pueblo de todos los argentinos que deber a aprovecharse
3910047 para que nos den con precisi n alguna idea de la continuidad de estas obras
3910048 si hay alguien que deber a dar una respuesta hoy es el ingeniero responsable de la empresa constructora silvio hellinger y el responsable de vialidad nacional a nivel provincial ariel arias
3910049 lo que sigue es un planteo al gobernador urribarri para que nos de respuestas no creo en absoluto en las autoridades locales de vialidad nacional ni en la propia empresa que hace cuatro a os y medio que venimos diciendo que la obra est pero no est
3910050 a estas altura de las circunstancias no haya funcionarios que midan lo que se ha hecho con esta obra no he conseguido durante estos cuatro a os y medio una respuesta precisa por una obra que deber a haber estado realizada en 12 o 18 meses
3910051 m s all de su compleja implementaci n es una forma poco efectiva de combatir la inseguridad

3910064 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3910065 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3910066 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3910067 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3910068 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3910069 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3910070 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3910071 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3910072 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3910073 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3910074 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3910075 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3910076 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3910077 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3910078 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3910079 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3910080 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3910081 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3910082 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3910083 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3910084 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3910085 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3910086 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3910087 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3910088 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3910089 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3910090 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3910091 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3910092 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

3910097 no se puede plantear una cr tica concreta porque se debe esperar el proyecto en s
3910098 se abrir un fuerte debate sobre la tenencia de huellas digitales por parte de entes privados
3910099 se est llegando a un l mite en donde lo constitucional parece estar dejado de lado
3910100 el sistema es f cil de burlar por lo que no cumplir a con su funci n
3910101 como lo presentaron hasta el momento cualquiera puede comprar un celular afuera y cambiar el chip que tambi n puede ser vendido de forma ilegal pero hay que esperar la ley
3910102 si se burla o no el sistema a n no se sabe pero hay que ver c mo afecta este registro al mbito constitucional como ciudadano no s si las huellas no son utilizadas para otros fines por eso s lo deber an ser tenidas aquellos que detenten el orden p blico
3910103 que el registro de datos estar en manos del estado y no de cualquiera que quiera vender la informaci n
3910104 las huellas digitales deben ser tomadas por la empresa pero la informaci n debe estar registrada en dominio estatal
3910105 en caso de un il cito el estado ya sea la polic a o el ministerio de justicia de la naci n debe tener acceso a la informaci n para ser til a la hora de resolver un verdadero delito

3910110 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3910111 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3910112 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3910175 one of the first catholic churches that was largely built by the mexican americans efforts and community was st marys church right down here on monroe street in the early 1900s the priests there banished spanish language services to the basement the mexican american community spanish language speakers did not take to that brought petitions to the bishop in tucson and were able to start their own church right down the street in immaculate heart of mary church where it would be spanish language speaking

3910184 i would put chelsea manchester united and liverpool as favourites again to win the premier league
3910185 but regarding arsenal they also have a great team but im not sure if the group has enough experience and quality to win
3910186 i see nobody else to win the premier league but tottenham surely have the quality to fight for a top four finish
3910187 i cannot really say who the surprise team will be but year after year we always wait for a better newcastle they are a top club they have a huge support and they have good players so we wait for more from them
3910188 in the french league i strongly feel the potential contenders to win this season are lyon

3910195 it will only serve to deepen the very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said it wants to be
3910196 and its very clear to me that the consequences of that which are already quite significant because of the way that russia has brutally pushed this military operation well beyond the bounds of anything that that might have related to south ossetia calls into question russias suitability for all kinds of activities that it has said that it wants to be a part of
3910197 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3910198 things have changed and so what i think russia is seeing is that to the degree this is about south ossetia about even abkhazia lets accept that it is time to end the fighting move the forces back to august 6th positions and then have a international mediation to try to resolve these conflicts within the context of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia

3910351 it was really the brainchild of ubisoft and them working with our integrations team and sales development team
3910352 we assess every title on our network for ad relevance and work with the publishers to make it happen if a game is set too far in the future or is historical or is a fantasy piece we pass on it assuming the game can be integrated with ads we look for placements that work in the games environment were looking to not over commercialize the looking to find the best placements in the game as we look at it we want to put in about five to six minutes of ads for every hour of gameplay that players experience the reality is that we want placements that catch the players eye and dont saturate the environment
3910353 through the integrations weve already worked into the game weve tagged placement for ads before hand we didnt have to re architect the game at all
3910354 ubisoft worked with ad packaging on the idea we just had to put together a series of events that was compelling to the gamer and the marketer as well and it just works well for the sku in all ways it worked out perfectly
3910355 it makes such a good fit for paramount because of the way the movie and game match up
3910356 promotions like this can be done in numerous markets this could be done in consumer package goods to soft drinks paramount is one of our first advertising partners and one of our most consistent customers the stars aligned the paramount team loves innovation and firsts and trying new things and then also ubisoft has been one of our best if not most progressive publishing partners i think weve carried six clancy games and its because they not only create great games but also because theyve been early in their adoption of dynamic ads

3910374 al d a de la fecha yo me siento con una deuda enorme con la gente que he representado porque considero que la investigaci n no ha sido completa no ha sido eficiente y que ha dejado un cabo suelto muy importante que desde el comienzo de haberlo reunido de haberlo investigado como se ten a que investigar quiz s hubi semos logrado incluir dentro del procesamiento a otra persona que creo yo est ntimamente vinculada con la causa me refiero a luciana fern ndez
3910375 dentro de lo que es el expediente en la actualidad la causa ha sido elevada a juicio caratulada como homicidio simple siendo el procesado roque fernando chauque y el tribunal del juicio es la sala ii de la c mara penal presidida por el doctor fr as conjuntamente con el doctor yermanos y la doctora chagra
3910376 hemos sido notificados nicamente de la constituci n del tribunal ahora el expediente est circulando por el juez yermanos y la jueza chagra para que ellos analicen si existe alguna causa para que se inhiban o declinen en su competencia y de esa manera luego nos correr n vista a las partes tanto abogados defensores como las querellas para que en un plazo de diez d as ofrezcamos pruebas l gicamente que esta prueba va a estar ce ida a la pertinencia en s de las mismas es decir pruebas id neas y que est n relacionadas con la causa
3910377 la competencia del tribunal est determinada por la acusaci n la acusaci n versa lamentablemente sobre el procesamiento de chauque por homicidio simple lo que no obsta que nosotros presentemos pruebas ya las hemos venido aportando desde un comienzo relacionadas l gicamente con los mensajes las llamadas la lista s bana que hemos presentado en la cual figuraban una serie de mensajes y llamadas que quince minutos antes de morir zambrano le habr a emitido a luciana fern ndez lo que dentro de todo estar a dando a entender de que ella no estaba con l porque cuesta creer que 15 minutos antes de morir se hallan estado mandando mensajes
3910378 hay una contradicci n muy pero muy severa por eso entiendo parcialmente al juez nieve he rescatado y he valorado su trabajo en cuanto lo ha hecho con la imparcialidad que merece pero creo que hay una deficiencia en cuanto a luciana fern ndez y una contradicci n enorme en el sentido que ella cuando prest declaraci n en sede instructoria manifest que el nico dinero que le prest a chauque eran cien pesos luego chauque ante la pregunta de este abogado respecto a la recepci n o no de dinero por parte de luciana fern ndez reconoci que la misma le hab a dado 4000 pesos entonces creo que este es el meti donde tenemos que investigar porque quiz s es un poco la reacci n que le genera a zambrano el saber que su dinero estaba siendo destinado para el amante de su mujer o concubina y que es lo que hace que me llame a m 24 o 48 horas antes de morir para pedirme que le solicitara a luciana fern ndez la rendici n de las cuentas no lo hizo y despu s muri lo que llama un poco la atenci n tambi n

3910388 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly
3910389 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3910390 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
3910391 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
3910392 fadel shanas death is a tragedy a journalist in action was killed by idf israel defence force fire along with others not involved in the hostilities however the available evidence does not suggest misconduct or criminal misbehaviour i have therefore decided that no further legal measures will be taken
3910393 the idfs decision to close its probe without taking any disciplinary action is the latest in a long line of cases clearing its soldiers of deadly negligence
3910394 the fpa believes the army is obligated to clearly identify its targets before firing especially in areas where civilians and journalists are present
3910395 whoa this thing that has taken to beating on all my vital organs is gonna be external here soon like sitting over there probably pooping and nothing will be in my belly anymore

3910403 we know that the russian government controls those servers theoretically if they have not been pwned by somebody else
3910404 i can only say i see a strong correlation with the types and patterns of activity of ddos and the strong very suspicious timing of the attacks its either one of the most coincidental mass cyber attacks ive ever seen or theres been some sort of cooperation on some level
3910405 while cyber war seems to be the current buzzword and is overblown over certain incidents the risk of information warfare is real as has been seen before in targeted attacks for espionage purposes and in the devastating infrastructure attack against estonia
3910406 weve partnered with one of the most respected companies in the industry as evidenced by their award winning brands and decades of expertise in production and distribution this agreement has given us a foothold for a reasonable expectation of distribution into some of the worlds highest volume international chains and thousands of other retail locations while it will no doubt take additional time and resources to establish our brands in these markets we consider this agreement a milestone for the company and its shareholders

3910413 all these addresses he lived there at one time but his family got tired of him and said you got to go you need to leave and he was just angry and lashing out at them
3910414 he did try to change his voice a little bit but all the family members that knew him picked his voice out almost immediately
3910415 theyre taking services away from someone who may actually need them
3910416 you dont find many in the gang intervention world who can be effective in the street effective in the courtroom effective at city hall and effective in the prisons

3910418 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
3910419 systemic antibiotics pills or injections as opposed to creams were implicated in 19 3 percent of all emergency department visits for drug related adverse events
3910420 persons aged 15 44 years accounted for an estimated 41 2 percent of ed visits infants accounted for only an estimated 6 3 percent of ed visits
3910421 they were old and we were hearing that they dont want kennels anymore
3910422 the best thing to do was get rid of them
3910423 that someone would shoot 70 dogs rather than spend money to do a vet check is extremely problematic
3910424 every humane society in the state would have taken those dogs
3910425 i would put chelsea manchester united and liverpool as favourites again to win the premier league
3910426 but regarding arsenal they also have a great team but im not sure if the group has enough experience and quality to win
3910427 i see nobody else to win the premier league but tottenham surely have the quality to fight for a top four finish
3910428 i cannot really say who the surprise team will be but year after year we always wait for a better newcastle they are a top club they have a huge support and they have good players so we wait for more from them
3910429 in the french league i strongly feel the potential contenders to win this season are lyon
3910430 in day one psg lost marseille drew and lyon are there again
3910431 meer details meer stuff meer lijstjes en cijfers en jaartallen
3910432 wij maken van onze studenten producenten van feiten maar ze zouden consumenten van kennis moeten zijn
3910433 studenten zijn collectioneurs en recre erders geworden in plaats van creatieve denkers het is een enorme verspilling van educatieve kansen
3910434 want je kan het instituut als zodanig verschillend defini ren maar je kan onmogelijk beweren dat het een creatieve plek is
3910435 ogen verwijden zich tot schoteltjes en boezems in gebreide vestjes priemen naar voren als ruggen zich rechten in woordeloos protest
3910436 bibliothecarissen benadrukken het belang van het traceren en toegankelijk maken van informatie maar er wordt nauwelijks aandacht besteedt aan wat de student doet met het gevonden materiaal de complexe cognitieve processen die een student moet verwerven om de informatie om te zetten in een diepe kennis en een waar begrip erger nog de student wordt zelfs ontmoedigd hulp te vragen bibliothecarissen wijzen waar ze boeken over het onderwerp kunnen vinden
3910437 en misschien dragen ze een paar websites aan maar verder moet de student het zelf uitzoeken zelfstandig studeren noemen we dat zelfstandig in de zin van aan zichzelf overgelaten of zoek het zelf maar uit weten we eigenlijk wel hoeveel kennis en bekwaamheid het vergt om goede notities te maken en relevante gegevens te verzamelen en kan het ons wat schelen of de student capabel genoeg is om gedetailleerde kennis te vergaren nee we schuiven dat pakketje maar wat graag af naar de leerkracht maar het zou ons wat moeten kunnen schelen want we zijn een schoolbibliotheek en ons intrinsieke doel is om de student te ondersteunen in plaats van het verschaffen van hulp and support benadrukken we het belang van het verzamelen van feiten en stimuleren we het knip en plak syndroom

3910451 ze heeft het ontzettend druk het is voor de kerst en dan is iedereen aan het rennen waarschijnlijk is het haar net niet gelukt om voor kerst de witgoedman te bereiken of misschien heeft hij geen tijd voor de installatie en dus dan zal het wel na de kerst worden tussen kerst en oud en nieuw zijn veel bedrijven gesloten dus het zal wel na nieuwjaar worden velen zijn de eerste week van januari nog op vakantie dus misschien volgende week

3910473 acquiring mo strengthens our nucleus of players for both the short and long term he is entering his prime nba years and will be part of the foundation of our future success
3910474 mo is a player that excels as a traditional point guard but also brings an extra dimension with his scoring and versatility his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us

3910478 why would they do that people like magnum ice cream
3910479 singing is not part of my day to day job but the people at carries place extend themselves every day to give women and children a safe haven so i thought id extend myself beyond the day to day things that i do
3910480 i think its important for men generally to acknowledge that domestic violence is not the way to deal with relationship problems and through my association with carries place ive come to learn that domestic violence does silence women
3910481 during the past few months ive come to learn a lot about the work of carries place and the tremendous contribution they give to the maitland community without places like carries place it would be difficult for some people to survive
3910482 but the refuge turns away a significant number of women and their children every year so this concert is a wonderful opportunity to raise funds and raise awareness
3910483 for far too long labor and the greens have dictated terms for this region
3910484 we believe they have held back the region this is an opportunity for voters to send a message to the state and federal labor governments
3910485 state and local governments need to work together and thats not working at the moment
3910486 whilst the community participation rates of around seven per cent are low this was anticipated and is in line with a trial of a similar service in melbourne last year
3910487 lessons that are being learnt from this first round of collections are that advance notification of the collection is critical so that residents can plan their own sorting and roll out
3910488 it is this big unknown in all of our lives
3910489 i find it so odd we dont even mention someone is dead we say they passed away
3910490 through writing the book i tried to demystify the experience
3910491 i have had a very warm positive response from a wide range of readers including men
3910492 i have also had an unexpected response from people who are dying or have loved ones who are dying
3910493 i have no argument with the alp ray fairweather has been really helpful and he does have so much to offer
3910494 but for the past four years the womens network has been pushing for more women to run for council as president i cant expect other people to do it if i dont
3910495 we want to improve the diversity on the council focusing on health education and facilities such as libraries and we want more support for organisations such as carries place
3910496 wed also like a more strategic focus on things like tourism
3910497 in our businesses we both see the pluses of tourism in maitland as well as a lot of opportunities
3910498 my push will be looking at things objectively calling on the view of the wider community and making politically courageous decisions that balance social economic and environmental aspects
3910499 i believe and i believe very strongly that we could easily get three women elected at this election and theres a big chance for four
3910500 that would increase our representation on the council by 100 per cent
3910501 it is a shame todays winner is not a member of players club as they would have received a phone call with the good news by now
3910502 jackpot lottery tickets have been selling really well as the jackpot is so high and many of our customers wait until the jackpot builds before they buy
3910503 we wont let those kids drive us out of here
3910504 a few days ago i received a cheque from the insurance company for the damage caused in a ram raid here eight weeks ago
3910505 all our stock has to go out now there are little pieces of glass in the clothing the shoes and handbags
3910506 nothing was stolen there was no attempt to take anything
3910507 i believe we may have become an easy target because of our position we have an open car park on one side of the shop and a glass side view
3910508 we will stay on regardless we wont be driven out of here because it makes these kids winners and we wont let them win
3910509 but i dont care if we have to replace glass every week until the kids get over it and move on
3910510 the police are doing their best but their hands are tied
3910511 the kids know exactly what they can get away with
3910512 we keep all the rocks from all the break ins
3910513 we will shortly be putting security cameras in the front area of our shop
3910514 shortly after 9pm a male and a female aged about 14 came into the service station and asked me the time
3910515 they left but returned a few minutes later with a taller man
3910516 as that man approached me he suddenly pulled out a long bladed knife and lunged forward
3910517 he came right up close and said give me your money
3910518 i was in a very confined area and i knew i could defend myself much better if i had more space
3910519 i watched that knife blade it was right in front of me as the man leaned over the counter but i held the broomstick high and managed to swing it round
3910520 i was petrified by what happened i couldnt sleep that night
3910521 but i wasnt going to let them take any money
3910522 while the console operator did well we say it is not advisable for people to take unnecessary risks

3910526 political expediency over the future of new yorks children and public schools
3910527 he was on foot he was on pursuit trying to chase him
3910528 its embarrassing for me as an officer to know that we have a person on the police force to know we have someone who would commit an aggravated robbery or become part of it
3910529 to some extent the olympics are beginning to influence how people use new technology
3910530 i dont think youre going to see too much of this in the future
3910531 to some extent the olympics are beginning to influence how people use new technology
3910532 i dont think youre going to see too much of this in the future
3910533 i was sort of nesting for a few years there
3910534 because i had been working from such a young age i wasnt sure about acting for a while and being in the public eye
3910535 i really wanted to step away from that which i got to do
3910536 in doing that i got to decide as a woman and as an adult when i was ready to go back to work as opposed to when i was a kid when it all just happened to me
3910537 i just wanted to see what it was like to be a mum and to work
3910538 the title page leapt out at me i started to read it an hour and a half later i picked up my head for the first time i was riveted
3910539 the minute i got off the plane i rang my agent and said i have to do this
3910540 i had never done something like this before i felt like there was something emotional and physical inside of me that i wanted to get out and i definitely got to get it out i got to scream all the time
3910541 my wife alex was pregnant and wed been thinking a lot about what sort of world we were bringing a baby into
3910542 i had had contact with french producers wild bunch whod put money into
3910543 i was in my underwear while i was on the phone so im intending to conduct all future negotiations for finance in my underwear
3910544 i called my office in new york said wow that was easy
3910545 were always having events interpreted by politicians and journalists i wanted to talk to the man on the street and get his perspective about osama and the way they think about america
3910546 some of the most beautiful parts of the movie are ordinary people muslims talking about what they want out of life i wanted the film to give those people a voice
3910547 the people got very upset became physical and there was quite a confrontation
3910548 my producer had to call in the police to get us out of there safely
3910549 it was a schoolboy fantasy come true to be able to fire a rocket launcher
3910550 we had to find out what worked and what didnt i dont think most people read the dense tomes that have been written about osama bin laden
3910551 my goal was to take a lot of information and boil it down into some very simple pieces
3910552 he has become an enigma an ideology that has infiltrated countries around the world
3910553 when you start to see that influence is out there and you see the impact that his ideas have its very disturbing
3910554 it may well be that the connection between riches and happiness is looser than most economic and political commentators
3910555 most market participants including moodys believe that the industry will survive but in a simpler scaled down form it will be a very long time if ever before the industry sees issuance volume in excess of 200 billion again
3910556 im trying to get through correspondence and stuff ive just let linger
3910557 im very bad with all this stuff so i attack it once every two months or so people want you to open a new wing of a school or something and its bad policy if you dont answer it you know
3910558 by moving out of my hometown to belfast then from belfast to dublin to join the national theatre of ireland then from there to london and then london to los angeles and los angeles to new york
3910559 i just always went where the work was it certainly wasnt going to come to me sitting at home in ballymena in the north of ireland
3910560 i think it is this is where i live where my wife and i are rearing our two children and its home i mean i never thought id say that in my life im living right in the centre of manhattan surrounded by skyscrapers and its home and it feels like home
3910561 well its not strange i mean they are new yorkers but theyre also irish english new yorkers
3910562 and we spend a lot of time in europe every year so we make sure they have access to their other cultures
3910563 its based on a true story that still hasnt been resolved lets put it that way
3910564 the last time i really worked in belfast was 1980 and when i was in the theatre there in the mid 70s it was a terribly terribly violent place you talk about tension crackling in the air it was there in spadefuls
3910565 when i think about it just the innocence of youth
3910566 when i think back on it now it was like my god the place was charged full of tension and hostility and bitterness
3910567 but this time going back it was a totally different northern ireland the troubles are definitely a thing of the past walking around the streets of belfast it was a tonic
3910568 it sort of felt like i dont really know this place as proud as i am to be from the north of ireland my homes in america
3910569 its a very simple thriller but i just love the physicality of it and i thought id love a chance to do this before i get too old and they wanted me to do it its always an extraordinary feeling when a bunch of strangers want you to do something
3910570 oh my god did i what i pride myself on keeping fit but for these guys it was like geez anyway ive still got pain and bruises in my shoulder and thats a year ago you know
3910571 at the time i shot it i was 54 years of age and i thought im not going to be asked to do this sort of stuff in the next few years so i may as well jump at it
3910572 i am disappointed that they have stepped away from this i know that there are practical difficulties and that there were matters of principle that the fashion industry found difficult but i feel the bfc should show leadership on this issue
3910573 i feel that to ask all models to produce a mandatory certificate of health compromises their dignity and potentially infringes their human rights
3910574 furthermore the logistical constraints involved with ensuring all models are medically checked in good time to fulfil work engagements represent an ongoing obstacle
3910575 liverpool is an excellent example of a city regenerating fast with unemployment halved and increasing inward investment
3910576 this is a counsel of despair and ignorance harking back to the tory days of margaret thatcher when norman lamont told people in the north to pack their bags and leave we have made vast improvements since then and policy exchange would do better to recognise success rather than to send people down to the overcrowded south east
3910577 i could either obstruct the pavement alongside a very busy road or face the prospect of never having my bins emptied again it makes you wonder what all our hard earned money is used for
3910578 the organisation has deficiencies which impact adversely on ethnic minority solicitors
3910579 the sra at present lacks the drive and the equality and diversity competence within its managerial and leadership spheres to make the changes happen
3910580 potentially this still leaves the sra open to the charge of institutional racism as its policies procedures practices and actions however unintended can be seen to have disproportionate detrimental and discriminatory outcomes for bme black and minority ethnic solicitors
3910581 not to be under estimated is the level of prejudice and bias which exists among personnel in this and other similar organisations
3910582 black and minority solicitors faced racism this is as serious for the legal profession as the lawrence inquiry was for racism in the metropolitan police
3910583 i think the author himself said it might be a bit barmy it is barmy
3910584 i gather hes off to australia the sooner he gets on the ship the better
3910585 conservative policy is focused on the good work of continuing the resurgence of cities across the north of england
3910586 i love it up here i wouldnt want to live anywhere else
3910587 close liverpool down its a great city ive brought up my children there i consider myself an honorary scouser and i wont have anyone rubbish the city its got a great cultural heritage and its given england quite a lot
3910588 cameron can distance himself from this all he wants but he needs to explain why his friends have no faith in the north
3910589 but from age three we knew something was wrong she was very introverted isolated when she started school at four she came home and said she was a freak it seemed a strange word for a four year old to use she was always quite a sad little person
3910590 looking back we could never find any tape in the house it was because she was taping her genitals up every day she said to us later that she thought it would all go right for her at puberty that her willy would drop off and she would grow breasts she said she was going completely crazy because she knew in her head that she was a girl
3910591 she was there in front of the mirror with her genitals tucked away
3910592 i had watched programmes on transgender im very interested in people its part of who i am to find out about these things but you never imagine its going to happen to you
3910593 it was apparent he was unhappy and said he wanted to be a girl
3910594 thousands of families face raising children who step outside the pink or blue box
3910595 well say things like youre special god made you special because there arent very many little girls out there that have a penis
3910596 it usually becomes more evident when they go to school
3910597 there have been reported cases of kids who wont drink for the duration of the school day so that they dont have to go to the toilet and who dont want to sleep in a bedroom with their peers
3910598 we get 60 to 80 referrals a year and our referrals are going up we see children from as young as six up to aged 18
3910599 we get a lot of calls from parents who have five to nine year olds there seem to be more boys than girls affected at that age
3910600 which is probably because its more acceptable for girls to be tomboys if you have a little girl who wants to cut her hair short or play football that is seen as normal but if you have a boy who wants to draw mermaids or dress up as a princess they get made fun of
3910601 for others it is likely to go on for some years and will cause a lot of problems
3910602 as far as theyre concerned a trans outcome is bad they are hoping that during puberty the natural hormones themselves will act on the brain to cure these trans teenagers what we do know is what happens if you dont offer hormone blockers you are stuck with unwanted secondary sex characteristics in the long term and in the short term these teenagers end up suicidal
3910603 the only indication i did have when she was a child was that she showed an interest in female clothing not wearing it but just having some in her room i said you mustnt take your sisters clothes and then forgot about it i was completely amazed shocked and frightened when i did find out some years later what was happening but i have always felt that people have a right to be who they are i felt that whoever this person was i was her parent and i wanted to support her
3910604 we have run 11 family workshops and seen over 200 individuals in family situations i like to think that we have helped an enormous number of people to get over that first shock of rejection and sadly sometimes revulsion
3910605 when you live with it it is so obvious and so extreme some of these children are saying from a very early age this is what i am why doesnt anyone understand that my name is bob and i am not a girl sometimes its as soon as they can talk at age two or three
3910606 the uk stance on puberty suppressing drugs is completely unreasonable in other countries they are provided as soon as puberty has commenced but obtaining this treatment which suppresses oestrogen in girls and testosterone in boys is very difficult in this country
3910607 it is a temporary reversible intervention if the child changes their mind they can be interrupted they are entirely benign with no known side effects
3910608 but there are cases that are very clear where the disorder is strong and persistent
3910609 the dutch data looks promising but they have not been doing it for so many years that you have long term follow up the data is not over a long enough period of time and that concerns endocrinologists
3910610 the question is if you halt your own sex hormones so that your brain is not experiencing puberty are you in some way altering the course of nature
3910611 there is a small amount of evidence for differences in the brain
3910612 that is a very interesting finding but it is not robust enough to say that it is definitely the only reason and that it is an innate condition it is most likely multifactorial
3910613 feelings are very intense and it is very difficult for families and young people to cope with the uncertainty they are very strong in their conviction that they are in the wrong body
3910614 at her school they were shocked but they were wonderful
3910615 it was explained to all the year groups that it was a condition and not a choice they explained the effect it had on her and that bullying would not be tolerated the kids were great it was the parents saying they didnt want a freak in school with their child
3910616 it takes a long long time to come to terms with it took us about two years to stop crying for our loss and also for the pain that we knew our child was going to have to go through no one would choose this its too hard ive asked my daughter if this condition was known about in 1989 when i was pregnant and there was an option to have a termination would you have wanted me to she said yes and i agree if i had known what it would be like for her i would have done it thats how bad it is
3910617 she is still young and everything is raw for her she hates the label transsexual she is just a girl who happened to need the surgery to make her genitals right
3910618 we are stunned and profoundly saddened by this loss words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of aid workers
3910619 it is not in our culture to kill women afghans never kill women
3910620 this unforgivable incident without any doubt was carried out by enemies of afghanistan by non afghans
3910621 we cannot say what motivated the attack the enemy are fanatics
3910622 i condemn this act and urge the authorities to leave no stone unturned in the search for the perpetrators
3910623 we havent seen as direct attack on the aid community as this for many years
3910624 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3910625 i think its very very important that the message goes out that the decades when europe was torn apart by the use of force are put behind us and its unacceptable for the difficult issues on russias borders to be settled by force
3910626 and given that weve got in the european union now baltic states and others with recent relatively recent experience in central and eastern europe i think its important we stand with them
3910627 we now need much firmer british leadership in response to this conflict to back up the efforts of president nicolas sarkozy
3910628 we are deeply concerned by increasing reports that russian forces are not abiding by the ceasefire and are moving into new areas of georgia
3910629 it is essential that all russian forces should withdraw from territory outside of abkhazia and south ossetia as president medvedev gave a firm undertaking they would do so that tensions can be reduced and negotiations can have a chance to proceed
3910630 rally the free world in support of a free georgia
3910631 cameronism is certainly not an ideology nor even yet a coherent political philosophy
3910632 cameronism displays a number of key features it emphasises the pragmatic over the theoretical takes an essentially optimistic view of human nature favours the devolution rather than centralisation of power stresses social rather than economic progress and places more faith in society than in the state
3910633 but cameronism diverges most sharply from thatcherism with its focus on social rather than economic matters
3910634 ok dave that sounds great nobody can sensibly argue against a more socially responsible civilised society
3910635 labour would love to be able to cut the law and order budget following an outbreak of humean humanity but how given that you mostly correctly suggest that the state cant do it are you going to lead us to this brave responsible world
3910636 even before becoming pm he is making a compelling argument for his own powerlessness at the head of government real power lies in society
3910637 if elected cameron will be first prime minister from britains ruling class for half a century but one who proudly claims not to be able to rule
3910638 cameron verges on hypocrisy on the issue of state action
3910639 he has set up a young adult trust which he says is working in partnership
3910640 a national programme to teach adulthood if ed balls schools secretary announced it the tories would be turning it into a piece of nanny state gone mad propaganda
3910641 cameron is quite right that labour is very often guilty of a knee jerk statism but he is equally at risk of an unthinking anti statism
3910642 the key debate for those who teach a level students and undergraduates is whether the pressure on teachers and lecturers to spoon feed a level students through exams means students fail to develop the desire to continue learning and the skills to learn independently
3910643 we urge the government to completely rethink the current targets regime as well as the curriculum and the current post 16 exams to make schooling more relevant so students leave school with the skills they need and a hunger to learn
3910644 children who do poorly at school are more likely to have been affected by the food they ate many years earlier rather than the chicken nuggets they had at lunchtime
3910645 bright and fierce and fickle is the south and dark and true and tender is the north

3910656 i dont think the results lived up to the expectations and upside scenarios that some investors had
3910657 that said it is a solid quarter guidance was slightly above where we thought it would be on revenue and storage fundamentals look pretty healthy
3910658 stand at the crossroads and look ask for the ancient paths ask where the good way is and walk in it and you will find rest for your souls
3910659 russia must be made to realise that its actions have seriously damaged its reputation
3910660 as part of the rehabilitation of the region any future peacekeeping force in abkhazia and south ossetia must be independent and not based on russian forces
3910661 it would be utterly unacceptable for russia to try and destabilise a democratically elected government on its border with a view to any sort of regime change
3910662 the international community would view that extraordinarily dimly and would have diplomatic consequences for russia
3910663 an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces
3910664 there is a clear responsibility on the russian government to bring this conflict quickly to an end

3910674 we have been dragging the koda government under severe compulsions for the last 23 months earlier aicc general secretary ajay maken was also saying the same things now it is time to take firm decisions
3910675 everything will be decided on sunday we have to respect the sentiments of our party workers at the grassroots level
3910676 we will be talking to the independents as well i am also aware the jharkhand high court has served notices to five ministers under the anti defection law everything will be discussed in the right perspective
3910677 seven of us are firmly with the chief minister only bandhu tirkey did not join our meeting if need be we will go to delhi a change of guard is not needed at the moment
3910678 your freedoms are in peril pray so you have the strength to protect them in the face of this aggression
3910679 independence day is approaching that is an abnormal day in the valley even at normal times i am not trying to be alarmist but be prepared for the worst
3910680 but our restraint will depend upon how much restraint these boys keep
3910681 they have been schooled in defiance all their lives this is sport for them
3910682 when i came into hollywood i needed an edge and had something that made me unique i havent been asked to do them yet
3910683 for the past few months we were like a cohesive unit
3910684 tonight i am going to take a glass of wine and sleep peacefully
3910685 it would be wrong to say that i was not thrilled
3910686 but then i was waiting for this day i dedicate this win to my family members

3910688 he has got consistency and makes great saves he is very athletic and explosive
3910689 we see it over the whole park not just a single trail
3910690 its hard to make generalisations it can depend heavily on species as some are more affected by recreation than others
3910691 these animals have high intelligence and those that are cautious survive
3910692 we looked on and off trail and found low abundance off trail too in accessible areas
3910693 were not in any way advocating that people stop seeing nature
3910694 but were trying to heighten the awareness of site managers to these unexpected impacts on wildlife
3910695 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
3910696 there doesnt have to be an environmental catastrophe for air pollution to cause injury
3910697 were talking about very modest increases air pollution can be dangerous at levels that are within the accepted air quality standards
3910698 patients with cardiovascular disease shouldnt exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels on very polluted days they should consider staying inside and during the winter they should limit exposure to fireplace smoke
3910699 of course the real solution is to reduce air pollution
3910700 the review by dr simkhovich and his fellow authors make it quite clear that air pollution is linked to cardiovascular disease
3910701 they suggest that this is another compelling reason to campaign for improved air quality while at the same time studying therapies to minimize the risk of exposures
3910702 although it is an old scientific chestnut we must once again emphasize how important it is to support continuing basic science on tropical forests

3910721 apple has launched its new iphone decisively into blackberry s business market by improving security e mail and allowing third party software to run on its platform but this is not a challenge research in motion maker of blackberry is going to take lightly its most consumer friendly phone yet the bold could launch next week while a multimillion dollar marketing campaign life on blackberry sees it make a more determined push beyond its corporate core
3910722 apple has set a target of selling 10m iphone 3g devices worldwide which could be tough in a weakening consumer environment
3910723 richard windsor analyst at nomura said blackberry s attempt to crack the consumer market has not been particularly competitive the apple experience on their device is second to none rim has a lot of work to do to catch up in scaling up its manufacturing and distribution capability as well as design he added

3910746 since dream images make no sense in ordinary terms people dismiss them as weird or meaningless but actually dreams are completely coherent if we take the time to learn their language we discover that every dream is a masterpiece of symbolic communication we may compare a dream to a screen on which the unconscious projects its inner drama we see there the various inner personalities that make up much of our total character the dynamics among the forces that make up the unconscious they take the form of images and the interplay of the dream images gives us an exact representation of those inner dynamics that go on inside us
3910747 i was never able to agree that the dream is a facade behind which its meaning lies hidden a meaning already known but maliciously so to speak withheld from consciousness to me dreams are a part of nature which harbors no intention to deceive but expresses something as best it can just as a plant grows or and animal seeks its food as best it can
3910748 dreams are a major thoroughfare to the unconscious psyche which is vastly larger than consciousness if we dont pay attention to them we limit our knowledge of the psyche to the relatively small segment that is conscious do all dreams have meaning we cannot prove that they do but many people spontaneously record or tell their dreams to them it seems self evident that dreams have meaning moreover psychotherapists and other workers with dreams have found meaning in nearly all of those studied failure to find a dreams meaning is probably the dreamers failure not the dreams
3910749 what excited me most when i first began to listen to my dreams was this sense that i was in touch with a great mystery something powerful seemed to be at work in my dreams something that seemed to possess a wisdom and purpose beyond my conscious mind to be sure special expertise is necessary for in depth analysis of dreams and in cases of emotional or mental disturbance the guidance of a trained analyst is required but most normal people who are able to cope realistically with everyday life can gain fresh insight into themselves through a laymens approach to dream interpretations
3910750 in interpreting dreams it is important never to feel that the dream has been exhausted at best one can find a useful current meaning to the dream but even this may be modified in the light of subsequent dreams for dream interpretation involves a continuing dialogue between the ego and the unconscious in the jungian view dreams are continually functioning to compensate and complement a milder form of compensation the egos waking view of reality
3910751 why should we look at dreams at all dreams help reveal to ourselves the hidden parts of our personalities of which we are usually unaware this revelation for that is how is usually feels has in turn a profound effect on our characters so much so that it could almost be said that we know only half the truth about ourselves and our dreams help us to meet the other half
3910752 every image that comes up in a dream means something but the same image may mean different things for different people or for the same person at different times in his or her life more often that not the people places objects and events in your dreams represent parts of yourself feelings fears desires attitudes and so on you may not be consciously aware of these and one of the main functions of dreams is to make you aware of these hidden parts and to give them your attention

3910771 while this technology is more than a decade away from the mass market we know it works because weve been advancing it in the real world with real customers
3910772 baptism is a sacrament of the new testament ordained by jesus christ not only for the solemn admission of the party baptized into the visible church but also to be unto him a sign and seal of the covenant of grace of his ingrafting into christ of regeneration of remission of sins and of his giving up unto god through jesus christ to walk in the newness of life
3910773 he saved us not because of works done by us in righteousness but according to his own mercy by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the holy spirit
3910774 by washing of regeneration i have no doubt that he alludes at least to baptism and even i will not object to have this passage expounded as relating to baptism not that salvation is contained in the outward symbol of water but because baptism tells us the salvation obtained by christ

3910781 i had no clue i was going in for a casting all i knew was that he wanted to meet me
3910782 its peculiar when the things you fantasize about when youre 14 actually happen this is the kind of role that i had fantasized about being in a woody allen film
3910783 i thought it was important to not play everything in the first 20 minutes to let her be annoying
3910784 to not necessarily show she was capable of great emotion and vulnerability allow her to be a bit of a difficult customer that gave me some distance to travel
3910785 hes not a very difficult person to get chemistry with
3910786 hes brilliant in this role because his sexuality doesnt necessarily come out of this kind of dark kind of macho place hes always being upfront and honest and actually very sensitive and caring and its no wonder really that everyone wants to jump into bed with him
3910787 i think she would have thought she was happy but i dont think she would really be happy she would probably suddenly in her early 50s start getting terrible headaches and find that she needs to go to bed in the middle of the day and walk around going why am i so depressed everything is great theres a lack of self awareness

3910817 i work nights and didnt think it was good to leave him alone
3910818 we didnt have no internet or stuff like that you can walk all the way to san antonio before you get any kind of communication

3910824 i thought he was a terrorist i swear to god
3910825 id set up on the apartment and watch him come out
3910826 he would walk all the way to the bus stop wearing his walkman and doing his michael jackson moves
3910827 i was not used to being in someone elses family to live with them like im one of theirs
3910828 tired of the schemes the lies are disgusting somebody please have mercy cause i just cant take it
3910829 when you fight monsters be careful that in the process you do not become one
3910830 my days are phantom days each one the shadow of a hope my real life never was begun nor any of my real deeds done
3910831 jason worried that he would never meet somebody and he would always be alone
3910832 drinking and scream ing at him because her other son ran away
3910833 messed jason up pretty bad he went on a bad drug binge and was shooting cocaine for a long time
3910834 it was like he had to give it to me
3910835 it was clear that jason knew what had happened to nicholas
3910836 his hair was dark but bleached blond and the roots were quite obvious
3910837 beverly said how dare you say hes not my son
3910838 i go to her house to get a blood sample and she lies on the floor and says shes not going to get up
3910839 i know that god punished me by sending you to me i dont know who the hell you are why the fuck are you doing this
3910840 i raise my pants so he can see im not wearing a gun
3910841 im fr d ric bourdin and im wanted by interpol
3910842 he tells ninety nine lies and maybe the one hundredth is the truth but you dont know
3910843 i wanted to know what had happened to that little kid
3910844 i said mom do whatever they ask you to do go take the lie detector test you didnt kill nicholas so she did
3910845 i said heres your brother long gone kidnapped and arent you eager to see him
3910846 involved in nicholass disappearance or had information that could tell us what had happened
3910847 i dont think you meant to do it but you did
3910848 i dont know why i liked her but i did she had this thousand yard stare she looked like someone whose life had taken everything out of her
3910849 if i went with my gut i would have known right away
3910850 i worked my ass off to raise my kids why would i do something to my kids
3910851 im not a violent person they didnt talk to any of my friends or associates it was just a shot in the dark to see if id admit something
3910852 im the worlds worst liar i cant lie worth crap
3910853 totally wacko a completely different person and it was scary
3910854 we just kept making excuses that hes different because of all this ugly stuff that had happened
3910855 i couldnt bond with him i just didnt have that feeling my heart went out for him but not like a mothers would the kids a mess and its sad and i wouldnt wish that on anybody
3910856 his teeth were different his voice was different his ears were smaller
3910857 one thing a mother ought to know was the identity of her child
3910858 he has lied and lied and lied again and to this day he continues to lie he bears no remorse
3910859 i feel sorry for him you know we got to know him and this kid has been through hell he has a lot of nervous habits
3910860 he did a lot of things that took a lot of guts if you think about it
3910861 i apologize to all the people in my past for what i have done i wish i wish that you believe me but i know its impossible
3910862 i told him what interests me in his life wasnt the way he bent the truth but why he did that and the things that he looked for
3910863 youre not a dad for six days or six months it is not a character it is a reality
3910864 the prognosis seems more than worrying we are very pessimistic about modifying these personality traits
3910865 when confronted with his misconduct the psychopath has enough false sincerity and apparent remorse that he renews hope and trust among his accusers
3910866 ive seen him now for two years and he is not that person
3910867 it doesnt matter i dont need my child to be perfect all i want is that this child feels love
3910868 so they sailed over to the region of the gerasenes which is opposite galilee
3910869 how are we bush people going to say anything about boats we could use our word for tying logs together on the river to make little rafts for sending garden food down to our village but thats not what jesus and the disciples did
3910870 isnt it clear from vv 22 25 that theyre still in the boat
3910871 national and provincial registries are critical tools for clinicians and patients these investments mean we will be able to offer hope and save more lives
3910872 health canada is pleased to have financially supported the excellent work of the ccdt over the last six years this work has served to identify key priorities and solutions for improving the coordination of organ and tissue donation and transplantation across canada and to bring us to this new juncture
3910873 canadian blood services takes seriously our new responsibilities for donation and transplantation in canada and will work closely with organ and tissue stakeholders in moving the work of the ccdt to action
3910874 you saw in the video how quickly this can be deployed how easily it can be transported so it will significantly increase our ability to respond to disasters
3910875 logistically its the fact that it doesnt require 10 soldiers to move around with it and one person can open it and close it in less that two minutes
3910876 we anticipate that this technology will actually expand to world wide applications very quickly
3910877 its exactly what weve wanted economically to have these manufacturing opportunities that solve the problems of the world
3910878 this and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs when he first appears he is a protector
3910879 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
3910880 contraception is not abortion the bush administrations proposal to change the definition of abortion and reduce womens access to birth control must be stopped
3910881 our enemies are innovative and resourceful and so are we they never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people and neither do we
3910882 the question is who ought to make that decision the congress or the commanders and as you know my position is clear im a commander guy
3910883 t he voter is a bona fide member of and affiliated with the political party in whose primary the voter seeks to vote
3910884 at the time the voter seeks to vote the voter declares allegiance to the political party in whose primary the voter seeks to vote and states that the voter intends to affiliate with that party
3910885 the guy who lost the election whining about losing the election
3910886 a donn son feu vert un accord qui sera approuv demain jeudi ndlr en conseil des ministres et qui contient 24 r formes
3910887 theres still opportunity for us and theres still time to wake up
3910888 we were looking for a spark to be able to bring the other guys up to a level we expect
3910889 when it became obvious that ryan was having some of the same situations that kevin was facing when he was quarterback we made the decision to go back with kevin glenn
3910890 i think kevin glenn is ready to come back and be the starter hes probably going to be calling 95 per cent of the game
3910891 mistakes are going to be made that happens no matter whos calling the plays so were just going to go out there and whatever glenn calls were going to go run it to the best of our ability
3910892 thatll be something new but at the same time were just going out to play football try and play football and get a win
3910893 as the russians move into georgia as aggressors and if you read the statements from the beginning from senator mccain and senator obama one had a kind of moral neutrality to it
3910894 and i say it respectfully to senator obama because hes a gifted young man but hes not ready to be president on jan 20th of 2009
3910895 i think that whatever we think at the moment that we can all reserve that for a future time
3910896 and i think judgments will be made about how we handled this situation how we approached the situation in iraq and how much experience and knowledge and background means in selecting the american peoples decision about who should be commander in chief
3910897 but i dont think were going to reignite the cold war here with russia i think this is a very serious situation but i dont see this as a return to nuclear standoffs et cetera et cetera
3910898 discussions about an international peacekeeping operation including canvassing nations for possible contributions to such a force
3910899 im sorry to be repetitious this is no time for that this is no time for that the time now is for the united states of america to act united on behalf of the people of the country of georgia and not do a lot of partisan sniping
3910900 its not an issue if you ingest it it has to be inhaled it doesnt go through your skin as you heard from the consultant the news is pretty good that the levels in the air in the community are not detectable and even in the workers who are working on asbestos right now and getting it up in the air and levels are 10 and 100 times less than the acceptable level however we now know that asbestos has been dispersed into areas of the community
3910901 if people have this on their property the best thing to do is not to touch it not to touch it and to make sure that its removed by a professional dont walk on it if you do walk on it clean your shoes off right away if you have it in your house which is extremely unlikely but lets say the windows were broken and you do find some of the white stuff in your house again dont touch it and call your insurance company to have it dealt with appropriately
3910902 we have had questions around whether peoples fruits and vegetables growing in the garden are safe as usual health advice its always wise to wash fruits and vegetables with soap and water and it will get rid of any asbestos if its there if there is dust in your home its not likely that its asbestos but its always good practice to wet mop it or clean it off with a wet material
3910903 while theres no question that asbestos would have become airborne in that initial explosion and people would have inhaled it ill leave the health discussion to public health but the hazard of asbestos is when its in a chronic or long term composure and that did not occur
3910904 now there is no doubt that parts of the area to the north and the east may have small chunks or flecks or pieces of asbestos the best i can describe it would be approximately the size of cornflakes present the monitoring done so far simply shows that there is no airborne asbestos now and in fact no airborne asbestos even when personal samples were performed on workers actively cleaning up this residue or debris
3910905 saying that one asbestos fibre can cause asbestos disease is saying that one ray of sunlight can cause malignant melanoma theres no question and easily proven by air monitoring that asbestos is natural in the environment and we all breathe asbestos every day i cannot prove that theres not one fibre floating around there with my name on it if i inhale it i wont get disease but you can readily prove and the royal commission which was in ontario approximately 20 years ago showed that we breathe asbestos every day of our lives typically in the order of several thousand fibres per day so i think its exceeding unlikely
3910906 the health risks related to asbestos are due to chronic exposure there is no short term tests which will actually indicate whether someone has been exposed to asbestos in this particular case since all of the monitoring that weve done inside the area during the cleanup indicates that there is no airborne asbestos so the concern over the children being exposed simply is i can understand the concern but it is not an appropriate concern
3910907 what we need is stuff installed and what we need is people to make sure its going to work and what we need is for the umpires to understand the protocol what we need is to make sure that everyone whos participating understands it
3910908 we are dedicated to rebuilding lives and communities one person at a time
3910909 poppa neutrinos zeal for life is infectious and while maybe a lifetime of wandering may be a little much you think maybe hanging out with the guy for a couple of weeks might be a hoot
3910910 i dont think the results lived up to the expectations andupside scenarios that some investors had
3910911 that said it is a solid quarter guidance was slightly above where we thought it would be onrevenue and storage fundamentals look pretty healthy
3910912 certainly ive seen a number of analysts say they expectus to beat beat beat
3910913 our vision for liberty advance is to be an experimental model for a way of life which is deeply rooted in spiritual growth health and wellness of the body mind expanding functionality knowledge and creativity through human development science and art and ecological balance and harmony with nature this wholistic approach is to be practiced within the individual within the liberty advance community and within the local geographical community so that its successful efforts may become an example for a new highly cooperative and resourceful global community the mission of liberty advance is to provide a place where one can retreat from day to day life so as to advance in ones effectiveness in the world and ones spiritual life individuals and groups may come to receive or to share support and training in a variety of ways and paths to inner freedom to practice ones own spiritual path in a private and natural setting to rejuvenate and heal to remove obstacles regarding relationships career or general satisfaction in life to improve athletic ability or to improve artistic creativity
3910914 i knew it was going to be a tough match
3910915 i made a lot of mistakes in the first set
3910916 when the second set began i decided i had to change up i started hitting a lot of heavy balls and lobs and i saw she didnt know what to do with those sometimes you have to win ugly
3910917 once i got my serve going and my feet moving i was able to move the ball around on her and make her play
3910918 if i will come back in the future i guess time will tell
3910919 in my announcement on may 13 i said i was stepping away
3910920 i never used the r word retirement that gave me an opening but i dont have a timeframe i have a lot on my plate and im excited about the next chapter
3910921 golf has been tremendous to me and thats one reason i want to stay within the game because i really love it
3910922 but what im not going to miss and one of the reasons im stepping away is that its really hard work to grind every day
3910923 its tough to travel every week ive dedicated my life to it pretty much since i picked up a club its over 20 years its been living breathing eating and sleeping golf so its time golf is part of life but its not life
3910924 if she goes out and doesnt miss practice and playing then shes not coming back
3910925 if she has a couple of kids and stays busy she has no reason to come back
3910926 i think one year at a time and well see how it goes i think it would be great to see her in five six years playing at the u s open or something and we can all enjoy her one more time
3910927 im doing the best i can to stay focused on the game
3910928 its never been about a farewell tour or about saying goodbye other than im here and i want to support each tournament
3910929 but i also want to win im a competitor but having said that i have not performed as well since i made my announcement maybe theres something unconsciously telling me its ok
3910930 lorena is leading the charge now and shes a fantastic person and a great golfer so i feel like the tour is in great hands
3910931 i cant think of a better spot than maybe march meadows in honeymoon bay on vancouver island to wind up my career but you cant host an event there
3910932 but its nice to see a lot of old friends and come back to a golf course that we played before in 1994 thats phenomenal
3910933 i do believe that hes hell bent on the restoration of russia as a major power in the world
3910934 i dont think it would be productive for our football team you have to be a productive part to be an nfl player there are responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege not a right there is a lot that comes with being an nfl player
3910935 i was dropped off at king street by my girlfriend and walked right past the fire engines
3910936 as i entered my office i smelt smoke and a colleague of mine came in and said that darrys was on fire
3910937 we went up to the top of the todd building that backs onto the restaurant and from there i saw some smoke but it appeared to be under control
3910938 i went back to my office but my colleague came in again about 10 minutes later and said there were flames
3910939 it was then that i went upstairs again and took this film it would have been about 9am
3910940 i filmed the blaze on my mobile for a couple of minutes and then the fire chief came in and said we had to evacuate the building immediately
3910941 the windows were starting to get quite hot and there was debris falling into the alleyway between our building and darrys
3910942 the fire seemed to be raging aggressively and it wasnt until about 30 minutes after this film was taken that the fire crews managed to climb onto the roof of our building to fight the fire from this side
3910943 the reports are rubbish i have not handed in a transfer request
3910944 they are not part of the plans of our technical staff
3910945 in the order of the coach these guys are the last they will not get a place at the first xi
3910946 the credit crunch is there and everybody has been affected by it we dont get away just because we are a football club
3910947 the banks are now tighter and not prepared to put debt on you just cannot continue to increase debts
3910948 i did say we intended to bring in three top players but that was before the credit crunch
3910949 the owner has already invested an incredible amount of money but we cannot keep spending the amount we have spent since the summer of 2007 in excess of 60million on players alone
3910950 on top of that you have agents fees while the wage bill has gone up substantially all that and with just 20 000 coming through the gates
3910951 people have to be realistic a few players might arrive but not for big money
3910952 losing steven is a massive blow he has been one of our most influential players during last season and especially this pre season
3910953 its a big disappointment not to have him he was a massive part of our success last season and he has come back for pre season looking just as sharp if not sharper
3910954 ado den haag have today reached an agreement with fk buducnost podgorica in a deal for bogdan milic
3910955 the 20 year old from montenegro had been waiting for a work permit but that has now been processed
3910956 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
3910957 we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3910958 they want americans to take transit and move to the inner cities they want americans to move to the urban core live in tenements and take light rail to their government jobs thats their vision for america
3910959 the breadth of performance sea kayaking is fairly astounding this video should be in your library
3910960 this video hits the mark quite neatly anyone watching this could not fail to pick up the most important points of long boat handling navigation skills and some basic rescues
3910961 if you could have only one video about sea kayaking this would be a very good choice
3910962 breadth depth and details make this video demand more than a one time survey a comprehensive sea kayaking instructional textbook
3910963 we bought one for rental but discovered people want to own it so now we sell lots of them
3910964 if you are serious about learning to sea kayak the video is well worth the price
3910965 theirrebalancing ranks are below the lower large cap buffer rank ofthe 450
3910966 i use this at least 3 times a day in my home gym
3910967 we are spending more and more time with our communicationsdevices but spending less on them
3910968 we may not yet have felt the full impact of the economicdownturn on consumer and advertiser spend
3910969 whiletelevision advertiser revenue has remained relatively steady innominal terms future stability cannot be taken for granted
3910970 while the secs intentions may have been good theirattempt to protect price with rule making was quite flawed andwithout intended effect
3910971 the financial strength of dominion one of the nations largest integrated energy companies will ensure both cirros ability to build upon our reputation as a leading texas retail electric provider and enhance our ability to grow and compete in the texas market
3910972 we know there has been some instability in the texas market
3910973 weve never heard of this before we dont know how it got there
3910974 we cant say whether or not the shark took a swimming young bear
3910975 we dont know how active these sharks are as predators
3910976 clearly the united states is far behind the rest of the world when it comes to true high speed internet access were fifth according to the latest survey from a u n agency that measures internet speeds
3910977 its not about how fast you can download a movie and those sorts of things but so many applications are not possible with slow internet speeds thats what were hoping these results dramatize to people
3910978 in telemedicine the university of georgia has connected 10 rural hospitals to the university lives are truly saved with this program as with a premature neonatal care program in alabama where mothers who live up to six hours away can have their babies monitored
3910979 cwa compares the u s average using this speed test to advertised speeds of carriers in other countries which is not an apples to apples comparison actual user speeds in those countries may vary just as they do in the u s
3910980 we ask the end users if they are satisfied with their current speed and 85 percent are very satisfied michael paxton an in stat analyst told technewsworld
3910981 for the way they use the internet it is more than enough bandwidth unless youre a big downloader or peer to peer user you have enough bandwidth
3910982 they dont prevent them those applications exist maybe not down to the household but between hospitals and a doctors office or research facility the applications that i have seen or heard about most peoples broadband connections can handle them
3910983 theres never a year when you dont have some challenges
3910984 but we had a harvest season that was almost perfect in terms of weather not too hot and not any rain
3910985 we would have had a tremendously larger loss if we would have had 100 degree temperatures
3910986 im down about 20 to 25 percent and thats kind of the rule of thumb
3910987 a good healthy price year will help inject a little more hope and optimism into the industry and a little more maintenance for some of these plants
3910988 sua vis o se tornar clara somente quando voc olhar para dentro do seu cora o quem olha para fora sonha quem olha para dentro acorda
3910989 he will be running circles around the rest of us in a matter of weeks
3910990 four years ago richard pound of the international olympic committee urged canadian governments to spend a relatively modest 50 million annually on olympic sport mushroom said
3910991 see i would argue spending 140 million is quite substantial for sport as opposed to say mri machines or job retraining or native drinking water or a million other things
3910992 in the 2006 07 financial year the australian sports commission spent 151 million to achieve excellence in high performance sport this included 56 million funding for the australian institute of sport
3910993 the spin off on the fabled 90s teen drama premieres september 2 8 p
3910994 to help spin the spin off original cast members shannen doherty jason priestley and jennie garth will reprise their roles as special guest stars on
3910995 but despite her announced participation tori spelling yet another star in the original series as well as daughter of the late tv mogul isnt expected back
3910996 the wilson parents rob estes and lori laughlin seem hip and handsome in ways the walsh parents carol potter and james eckhouse were not
3910997 i think its important to show what kids really use
3910998 filling up with a tank of gas could soon have devastating consequences to rain forests their people and their species
3910999 this is in the national interest it is the image of our national music national culture especially during the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
3911000 these are just games meant to be enjoyed by the chinese people and for the people of the world dont sully their purity with politics dont spoil our wonderful party with talk about rights or ideals
3911001 hey this kid is going to ruin my career and insert excuse here so get an abortion or
3911002 we should continue to push for a united nations security council resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence its a clear violation of the sovereignty and internationally recognized borders of georgia
3911003 our primary focus right now is on ensuring the safety and security of our students and fully investigating these allegations which we consider very serious
3911004 i am proud to endorse brian foley for state senate
3911005 it is time for change and i encourage all my supporters to join me in supporting and actively helping elect brian foley to the state senate
3911006 the democratic party is united and ready to fight for the change our working families so desperately need
3911007 brian foley will be an independent voice for change in the senate not someone beholden to the special interests in albany
3911008 we are united in our support of brian foley and look forward to actively helping elect him to the state senate
3911009 i thank jimmy and our democratic leadership for their support only together united can we end the stranglehold of special interests in albany it is time for change and i look forward to continuing my campaign for the working families of islip and brookhaven
3911010 create the most capable and effective u s distributor network in the business
3911011 ive loved and been loved all the rest is background music
3911012 if people dont want to come to the ballpark how are you going to stop them
3911013 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3911014 were learning more about angel flight and how they operate tim monville of the national transportation safety board said
3911015 i am aware that ntsb has conducted several investigations into angel flights
3911016 altitude alert climb immediately angel flight 15 delta climb immediately
3911017 we take people coming out of maine that find they have to go to specialized care in boston for example
3911018 how does one get from northern maine when theyre told they have to be in boston 2 3 4 times a week
3911019 it becomes a physical impossibility for them if not a financial one
3911020 i dont know what to say about it other than it seems coincidental to me at the moment
3911021 if it gets worse theyre gonna get my kids too
3911022 thats why i want them out soon i am begging
3911023 hes got to make it to the border and get with a small team hike through to the farm
3911024 ive asked them if necessary can we do an extraction
3911025 he said all ideas are on the table but that can be riskier
3911026 i cant stay here what do i have here to stay here
3911027 these transactions get processed and routinely approved by the bank at a 34 fee
3911028 id rather go swipe my debit card and they say insufficient funds than get hit with a 20 overdraft fee
3911029 we really feel that banks should be helping consumers in this effort instead of stacking the deck against them
3911030 overdraft fees are the second largest revenue generator after mortgages
3911031 so you can imagine with the downturn in the housing market its reasonable to think banks are now trying to beef up their bottom line
3911032 its still an ordeal and i never know when its going to be over
3911033 im very afraid now every time i go online and look up my personal info what im going to find
3911034 unfortunately they send that letter out but they do nothing to stop the change of address from going through
3911035 you would think alerting them to this problem would get them to solve it
3911036 given that there are virtually no obstacles to committing this kind of crime its remarkable it doesnt happen anymore
3911037 there is nothing negative about a name like coca cola or mcdonalds today in the 1970s maybe it was
3911038 its been a great thing to happen with the product line particularly with the helmet because its so visible
3911039 i was doing something i dont normally do changing the theme of the blog but it turned out that it was just after the hacker had got in
3911040 he or she was creating a web page factory within my website that probably within about 24 hours created a few thousand pages every time a search engine came in it would build a new link
3911041 it was amazing i had the site fixed within 48 hours but even a week or two after that if you did a search for some of these things my website came up as number one two three
3911042 we are seeing more and more websites becoming infected we count 16 000 new malicious web pages every day its one every five seconds and 90 of them are on legitimate sites that have been hacked
3911043 a lot of that will be the bad guys setting up blogs with malicious content but some of them will also be sites that have been hacked
3911044 as bloggers have updated to the patched version of wordpress we have seen the number of hacked blogs drop accordingly
3911045 they want to keep it running so they want to avoid being a blip on the radar
3911046 however these types of tools are overkill for most blogs my personal belief is that hosting providers should offer these services
3911047 on saturday morning i do a check of my various blogs and on monday i do it again
3911048 on the internet a lot of traffic comes through google so you want to be sure you have a good record with them
3911049 we have a very close working relationship with lafarge and this coupled with cnes vast experience in heavy lifting removal and installation work resulted in lafarge inviting us to tender for the installation work as well as the manufacturing of the replacement roller shaft we beat off fierce competition to secure the contract
3911050 astms proven ability to produce globally used consensus based standards in environmental and sustainability areas make it well suited to support the goals of this new standards writing activity and the open process needed to ensure its utility
3911051 the formation of astms new main committee on sustainability will be a precedent setting activity consensus standards will break down barriers to global sustainable development moving it beyond the discussion stage and into widespread implementation throughout mainstream markets astms highly organized and accessible forum is the perfect place where cross industry stakeholders can make these goals a reality
3911052 dont set up any more meetings with governors it makes absolutely no sense to do this if we dont have stability in the incentive programs
3911053 sure well need wind and solar energy but its just not cost effective yet
3911054 the best chance we have perhaps the only chance of addressing the combined challenges of energy supply and demand climate change and energy security is to accelerate the introduction of new technologies for energy supply and use and deploy them on a very large scale
3911055 the most effective initiative though politically difficult would be a major expansion in quotas for skilled immigrants
3911056 perhaps 150 000 of those are loosely classified as skilled
3911057 a double or tripling of this number would markedly accelerate the absorption of unsold housing inventory for sale and hence help stabilize prices
3911058 imma kill yo ass no my friends this is not love like you think this is straight up lust i mean i know we have all fell in love a time or two but
3911059 that cant be contemplated under any reasonable and fair set of industrial relations laws
3911060 its just so important that these laws are removed and theres new legislation where people have got decent rights decent rights to be represented by their union and decent rights to make sure their entitlements arent stripped away by unscrupulous employers
3911061 its very important that we dont have people left in this situation again where their entitlements are stripped away from them and they are at risk of being forced on the job scrap in poverty

3911071 in making this agreement with e s d we have become aware of the remarkable resources that exists in this company and in china generally we intend to mine the innovative technologies being developed there and to ensure their exposure to the wider world this is true two way trade and it supports the mantra vision sustainable renewable and profitable
3911072 broadcast industry workers in new york state should be grateful to local vice president bob hellwitz for his tireless commitment to passing this law
3911073 the contract provisions were banning placed an unfair burden on these professionals by limiting their ability to move to other employers we hope to empower broadcasters with greater independence as they pursue employment options
3911074 we dont think it was drug related we dont think it was gang related
3911075 apart from that there were some words that were exchanged prior to the gunfire and mister lopez was pronounced dead at the scene
3911076 its gone from bad to good and now it goes in between bad and good
3911077 now it has gotten a little bit better and its not as rampant as it was earlier but there is still a lot to be done
3911078 its not safe for a good people to live here and i mean this area is kind a bad

3911081 were proud to help launch this new scholarship program in memory of elroys dedication and leadership to chs and commitment to the future of agriculture and cooperatives
3911082 we never say no to help at the same time its been truly remarkable for the sheriff to now stand up and declare his willingness to cooperate
3911083 my rejection of the sheriff was a rejection of his characterization of the pace unit as a worthless effort
3911084 they must really be desperate just the thought of talking about this is making them hunker down politically
3911085 there are more effective ways to work with the city problems the only thing i need and this community needs is two of their good officers doing zero tolerance work
3911086 first i do not think it is a good idea to discuss law enforcement strategies in public thereby informing the criminals of our plans
3911087 second meetings are unnecessary because the police department will agree to utilize sheriff becks deputies as part of lpds currently existing concentrated law enforcement activities
3911088 basically at this point each of us has individuals were getting in touch with to form a base that base will be contacting other individuals around the county to also participate and provide feedback for us
3911089 weve got just about everybody on just about every level a multitude of different individuals with different experiences were going to try to notch the communication up about 10 levels
3911090 i think its basically just to make the community the best it can be there are a number of shortcomings were aware of and a few were not fully aware of yet i think its going to be a learning process for everybody involved

3911093 theyre imploding over there they lost jeff kleeman they lost dennis rice theres a lot of tension between wagner and harry sloan and tom and the whole thing everybodys second guessing them in the press theres been a lot of in fighting its certainly not like paramount where they were treated like royality and paulas got plenty of money and probably just threw up her hands and said the hell with this i dont need it
3911094 i prepared to hurl myself into the diseased water to rescue my beloved canine
3911095 what stands out is the mediocrity of a group of technicians and developers who are well meaning but full of an anachronistic paternalism in the best of cases and are once more using gaud to leave their personal mark on the building to the detriment of the original work
3911096 what they are constructing has little to do with the spirit of gaud it has more to do with building a tourist attraction and for propaganda purposes
3911097 this was a disaster because even though they had all the necessary documents regarding the material and techniques to be used they were not followed
3911098 the problem with restoring gaud s work is that by the time there was an awareness of his legacy he had been dead for 50 years
3911099 keith faber to the district is a disaster for the past 16 years senator faber and his colleagues have been a disaster for the district
3911100 in our district all the good paying jobs are gone these republicans and senator faber have done nothing hes getting all this money from lobbyists i dont get a penny
3911101 weve got a hidden tax in this district i track it directly to the incumbent and his colleagues in the ohio legislature
3911102 what is the faber tax if youll note in the last few years weve had double digit increases in virtually all the prices whether theyre at the pump your utilities your insurance your medical your grocery stores everywhere you go you get double digit increases because of keith fabers refusal to regulate anything
3911103 he has great sympathies for all of his massive contributors whether its insurance or real estate or wine and liquor or assorted lobbyist interest it goes on and on the reason they will contribute to mr faber and not tom matthew is because he is a reliable recipient of their money with reliable votes in their interest
3911104 im saying this is not in the interest of the average constituent of the 12th senatorial district because what happens is nobody is paying any attention to their pricing so they jack up these prices unconscionably and over the last year two years three years every year double digit increases in everything
3911105 weve got a man now who i consider a man of the people
3911106 hes a humble guy hes a spiritual guy hes a hard working guy
3911107 when you look at shawnee county this area is the bulls eye and i think that our project is a winner right in the bulls eye
3911108 i think its cleaned up the area and i think that the long term benefit wont be noticed for a year or two but i think the benefit will be good

3911114 for us in venezuela everything is new and every time we play something it is also like the last time this is how i grew up
3911115 i respect and have learned a lot from the european tradition
3911116 when young people see orchestras just sitting down and doing concerts each week they see something routine they cant understand what people enjoy about it
3911117 in venezuela going to a symphony concert is like going to a pop concert everyone feels very proud it is our symbol we have our flag our national anthem and now our orchestras the citizens feel part of it
3911118 whoever the guy was that was off to the side had he been right there with her maybe he had a gun or he was going to muscle his way into the door or whatever my husband could have been hurt badly
3911119 about 12 15 my husband heard somebody pounding at the door
3911120 i need money for gas i need 20 for gas my four kids are in lawrence and ive got to get to them
3911121 she was talking to somebody and talking to my husband and trying to find a way to get in
3911122 when i checked the door this morning this is the way the handle was and he knows he didnt try to open this door she had to have grabbed a hold of the door knob to try to get in
3911123 she couldnt get the door open theres no way you can get it open
3911124 by no means makes me feel safe about answering the front door
3911125 the writer dic edwards and the composer keith burstein presented a complex view of the motivations ambitions and doubts of those attracted to suicide bombing
3911126 unsurprisingly burstein took the reviewer to mean that he was glorifying terrorists and thus once the terrorism act 2006 came into force at risk of prosecution should the opera be revived
3911127 we referred to a composer as being accused of promoting terrorism we should have made clear that this was the meaning the composer keith burstein ascribed to a review of his opera the court of appeal did not accept that the review conveyed this meaning and ruled that this conclusion could be reached only by a strained interpretation
3911128 it makes it so much easier you just cant imagine
3911129 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

3911131 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3911132 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3911133 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3911134 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3911135 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3911137 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3911138 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3911139 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3911140 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3911141 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3911142 er is een land van de levenden en een land van de doden de brug is liefde de enige overlevende de enige zin
3911143 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3911144 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3911145 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3911146 the baltic has the potential to be one of the great art institutions in the world and has done many wonderful things
3911147 it needs to keep doing these things and its work deserves to be the centre of attention
3911148 i hope to bring the artistic side and business side to a successful coincidence
3911149 it was never going to be easy to leave mima
3911150 it was massively rewarding but this is a very exciting opportunity it needed to be something like this to tempt me away
3911151 we considered many excellent candidates for the post against stiff competition i am thrilled and excited that it is a candidate from our own region that has come through
3911152 you have to look at things like the development perspective and what this all means for developers and hows this changes the game
3911153 weve provided competition in a market that desperately needed competition

3911160 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3911161 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3911162 a 16th place time in 2008 would have been on the medal podium in 2004 i have friends in track and field and they ask whats up with all the world records i think its because track is a lot more advanced in its evolution than swimming but phelps is pushing everyone else to new heights
3911163 the talk circulating from teams 1 8overseas3 8 what theyre willing to do as athletes you have to listen
3911164 i think as a basketball level there is not a great difference between euroleague and the nba
3911165 when you have some teams moving faster than nba teams and showing more interest and they offer you the possibility to be the main guy and have more playing time and have the ball in your hands and at the same time its economics thats a strong thing
3911166 thats the situation for players like childress and me and guys moving to europe we think its a good situation right now
3911167 in fact we see this as a positive indication of how popular the sport of basketball is on a global basis
3911168 even with the money that some of these leagues and teams are offering theres something about playing in the nba
3911169 its a beautiful building to see it torn down would be sad
3911170 we were watching all the buildings being torn down and thought would that be a nice addition to our property
3911171 it costs money to demolish its cheaper to have it taken away

3911230 theres no question that these upgrades to the midland highway are needed to help make the highway safer for motorists and their families
3911231 thats why we have brought the money forward to get these important projects started as soon as possible
3911232 todays 4 5 million announcement builds on federal labors commitment to deliver a massive 426 million tasmanian infrastructure over the next five years more than two and a half times what the former government provided in the last five years
3911233 the constitution hill upgrades will help to limit conflict areas for turning traffic and play an important role in minimising crashes at this section of the highway
3911234 i have spoken to the federal minister and he understands the importance of these projects i am really pleased that the rudd government is delivering this funding
3911235 the midland highway is particularly difficult stretch of road during winter because of ice and fog and safety is our number one priority
3911236 this is a good reminder digging planting something in the yard fence call and get a locate
3911237 we are committed to reducing crashes on our roads accidents take a huge toll on families our communities and the economy
3911238 thats why the black spot program is a vital element in the governments plan to improve road safety it targets roads that either have a history of crashes or a significant risk of crashes occurring
3911239 the black spot program complements our funding to major national infrastructure links in tasmania like the brighton bypass and the north east freight roads
3911240 this is about improving road safety at both the national and local level
3911241 from next year 2009 10 the rudd government will deliver on its election commitment to increase black spot funding by a massive 33 per cent next year up to a record 60 million nationally
3911242 the program has a proven track record of saving lives at least 32 deaths and more than 1 500 serious injuries were prevented as a result of the program in three years an evaluation by the bureau of infrastructure transport and regional economics has shown
3911243 for every 1 spent on fixing black spots around 14 is returned to the community through a reduction in the number and cost of crashes
3911244 from hobart to devonport from newnham to brighton we are fixing dangerous intersections to help reduce accidents and their costs to the economy
3911245 these projects were assessed and recommended by a panel of independent road safety experts they included the royal automobile club of tasmania and the tasmanian state government
3911246 our compliance program is an important part of our prevention is better than cure approach to tax administration in which we seek to help people understand and meet their tax and superannuation obligations at the lowest possible cost to them
3911247 by publishing our compliance program we are letting the community know where we will focus our attention and the action we will take so people know which areas of risk they should avoid
3911248 this year we are expanding our coverage of income tax compliance issues across the board with the support of additional government funding
3911249 we are continuing our strong focus on detecting and discouraging the abusive use of tax havens and dodgy tax schemes we are also encouraging people who may have done the wrong thing to come forward before we contact them and take advantage of
3911250 this year we will expand our review of executives and directors to include senior executives of private and foreign owned companies focusing on their remuneration packages and any failure to report equity benefits and cash or share bonuses
3911251 we are also examining the compliance risks associated with partnership and trust distributions and i encourage tax agents to discuss this matter with their clients and advise them to come forward if distributions have not been correctly declared
3911252 large business issues on our agenda include promoting good corporate governance and looking at global corporate restructures that shift assets offshore
3911253 we will tackle the unfair cash economy practices that adversely impact many small businesses by working with more industries to develop benchmarks that businesses can use as a guide to getting their tax right
3911254 this will be backed up by greater use of data matching to more effectively identify and target people who may have under reported income or over claimed expenses with more than 5 000 cash economy audits or reviews
3911255 we are also improving our assistance program to support small businesses with a particular emphasis on helping businesses get started and stay on track

3911260 since 2001 the tjala arts centre has grown by almost 100 per cent as a result of an increase in art sales
3911261 this in turn makes a huge contribution to the economy of the community
3911262 many artists working at the centre have achieved national and international reputations and the centre is now recognised as a provider of high quality work
3911263 people living in remote communities face unique challenges and we need to do what we can to help them support themselves
3911264 a new arts centre will give the amata community the scope and opportunity it needs to maintain and even increase the positive momentum it has gained through its production of a range of art works
3911265 i encourage interested candidates to lodge their nomination as early as possible in case there are issues to be resolved before the nomination can be accepted

3911361 none of the people who put this report together would have imagined that financial sector write offs and loss provisions would approach 500 billion
3911362 these factors are related to global economic and financial imbalances that have long been recognized as potential sources of instability
3911363 the extraordinary tightness of credit spreads was widely seen as unsustainable
3911364 a much more plausible explanation lies in the fact that the preceding eight to ten years had witnessed multiple financial disturbances with multiple causes all of which resolved themselves with limited damage and negligible contagion

3911374 hothead has brought both downloadable episodic games to both pc and console with this penny arcade partnership and along the way learned some valuable lessons from the difficulty of working with fresh licensors to the trouble with and benefits of outsourcing a sidebar from jerry tycho holkins and cover art from mike gabe krahulik round out the piece
3911375 apart from coming to terms with the sheer amount of work they had to do probably the biggest shock for the penny arcade guys was seeing a game that was half finished
3911376 as developers we took for granted that we could look at the game when it was midway through production and envision where it would end up as additional layers of polish were added
3911377 the game length problems were exacerbated by their lack of experience as well story and dialogue are the key factors that determine the length of an episode and those items came directly from penny arcade
3911378 since virtually no one at hothead had worked on adventure games before it was like the blind leading the blind with no one having intuition about how the current story translated into game length this was one of the factors that led us to work with lucasarts adventure game veteran ron gilbert
3911379 a final issue was managing who was in charge of certain decisions as we progressed it became clear that the dividing line between their responsibilities and hotheads was blurry
3911380 for example the nonlinear dialogue trees in the game are all script jerry wrote every word but finding your way through the dialogue is gameplay and the type of information that gets revealed reiterated or emphasized during each dialogue encounter is key to making a solid adventure game and to ensuring that the player is always aware of what she or he needs to be doing
3911381 and yet numerous times during the project we noticed the scope creeping larger as the team fell into old habits we all had from making larger games destined for retail
3911382 at one point the issue grew to such an extent that we had to step back and rethink how big we were making the game we realized we were setting a trend with the first episode that we would need to maintain with future releases these adjustments were not easy to make and cost us extra time
3911383 as a large portion of the team rolled onto the second installment i started hearing discussions on the team that made it clear we were thinking about
3911384 looking ahead we will have to ask ourselves if we are sticking to those practices or if we are sliding back into older more familiar habits that will prevent us from reaching our goals
3911385 focusing our company on selling games online and funding the games ourselves meant that we could remain independent of publishers
3911386 this model was a big change for everyone at hothead with virtually all our veteran staff coming from work for hire developers the change in dynamic was most evident because we were no longer shipping off monthly milestones to a publisher
3911387 despite the appeal of this we realized midway that monthly milestones provide a convenient pressure to keep a project on track we had to come up with other ways to motivate ourselves to hit interim milestones a surprisingly difficult task when they are not tied directly to revenue
3911388 despite that it was a refreshing change to be able to make a game from beginning to end answering only to ourselves
3911389 the core name is and will be our flagship pc processor brand going forward
3911390 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now

3911403 the nigeria government asked virgin some years ago to set up a national carrier that nigerians could put their trust in and be proud of virgin agreed to help enable this to happen but made it clear that they would only invest considerable sums in nigeria under certain strict criteria

3911507 leadership involves far more than promoting programs and making speeches and since no one can predict what crises will happen over the next four years it is vital to know the decision capacity and process of each man
3911508 making up your mind questions to consider before the election
3911509 and made available for use in small group discussions within churches across the country
3911510 in addition to my primary calling to proclaim the gospel truth of salvation in jesus christ these civil forums further three other life goals helping individuals accept responsibility helping the church regain credibility and encouraging our society to return to civility
3911511 further polarization in the catholic community will happen during this presidential election season
3911512 makes us increasingly ineffective in living out catholic social teaching and producing change for social justice
3911513 set up a separate pro life ministry with its own staff and network right across the hall from its office for social development and world peace justice and peace
3911514 set in motion a chain of developments that has compartmentalized catholic social teaching and helped to create two catholic constituencies
3911515 often have little in common have opposite worldviews regarding culture and politics and frankly dislike each other
3911516 pick and choose their favorite catholic social teaching concept and discard or trivialize other important elements
3911517 to claim the mantle of faith by using terminology sometimes taken directly from the compendium on catholic social teaching to describe their beliefs about the poor the unborn and the like
3911518 proclaim only part of the teaching not all of it
3911519 quickly grabbed onto cardinal joseph bernadins consistent ethic of life metaphor implying if not asserting outright that certain catholic politicians who were pro abortion made up for it by being good and therefore acceptable under the catholic mantle on a host of other issues on the spectrum poverty health care etc
3911520 will overlook a catholic politicians perfect 100 percent rating by naral national association for the repeal of abortion laws and do anything to elect them with an equal amount of passion
3911521 although it is now difficult one hopes to maintain catholic identity and be pro choice they survive by winking and nodding at the abortion issue basically trivializing it
3911522 developed a tunnel vision approach which would not even mention any other issue regarding the poor other than abortion
3911523 brought with it support for no tax and spend policies and a philosophy of government that does not align with classical catholic social teaching and vatican encyclicals of the last 100 years
3911524 does not have different principles for different social issues there is no set of catholic teaching that applies only to life issues or only to issues of economic or social justice
3911525 is the anthropological assertion that every human being has a dignity that is sacred that every person is made in the imago dei regardless of race or creed whether rich or poor smart or not athletic or disabled that principle extends from the moment of
3911526 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3911527 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3911528 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3911529 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3911530 i dont know but i sure dont like those who ask that question
3911531 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3911532 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
3911533 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3911534 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
3911535 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3911536 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
3911537 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
3911538 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
3911539 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
3911540 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3911541 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3911542 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
3911543 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
3911544 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
3911545 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3911546 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3911547 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3911548 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3911549 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
3911550 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
3911551 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3911552 the right information has to be given to the people
3911553 yang peiyi missed out on selection to appear at the ceremony because of her external appearance it was for the national interest
3911554 chens original interview was posted on beijing radios web site sunday night by tuesday the link was shut down the chinese government routinely blocks sites that are politically sensitive or that could cause embarrassment to the countrys communist rulers

3911559 the mccain campaign has been trying to tear him obama down at every opportunity and they keep on zeroing in on this idea of celebrity lets take a quick look at the latest ad from the mccain campaign that hammers obama on that point
3911560 the clintons are going them and their attack dogs the press does that defense for obama against complaints about the press favoritism by attacking the attacker
3911561 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3911562 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3911563 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3911564 we only have two practices left before the game and we do monitor that stuff
3911565 you guys talked to him more than i did so i dont really know where he is with that
3911566 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3911567 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
3911568 i think you can ask the receivers he still has it
3911569 but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3911570 i said look i heard youre not talking to the media
3911571 he said its not that its not that i obviously was joking on that i said look im not here to take chads spot or replace him or whatever it is what it is
3911572 i said this the other day i dont think ive ever beaten chad
3911573 we cant just stand here and wait to die move your ass
3911574 you are hurt pretty bad i should not have left you
3911575 lets get going i would have left your ass too
3911576 i dont have time to wait for an answer i only know one thing
3911577 but its not like i was actively trying to find out what he did
3911578 whenever he would go out and get some equipment that he needed to do a repair job
3911579 he was always gone three to four hours the technicians we have in there now have never been gone more than 30 minutes on the same types of repairs
3911580 the suspect became belligerent and offensive the suspect also began to ramble that mayor hammer and the police are out to get him
3911581 by an action that occurred on a traffic stop within an hour of my purchasing the arena environmental impact report

3911587 d etection of liquid ethane confirms a long held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on titan
3911588 ontario lacus is roughly 20 000 square kilometers 7 800 square miles in area slightly larger than north americas lake ontario the ethane is in a liquid solution with methane other hydrocarbons and nitrogen at titans surface temperatures approximately 300 degrees fahrenheit below zero these substances can exist as both liquid and gas titan shows overwhelming evidence of evaporation rain and fluid carved channels draining into what in this case is a liquid hydrocarbon lake earth has a hydrological cycle based on water and titan has a cycle based on methane

3911592 w e have water weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
3911593 laboratory tests aboard nasas phoenix mars lander have identified water in a soil sample the landers robotic arm delivered the sample wednesday july 30 2008 to an instrument that identifies vapors produced by the heating of samples with enticing results so far and the spacecraft in good shape nasa also announced operational funding for the mission will extend through september 30 the original prime mission of three months ends in late august the mission extension adds five weeks to the 90 days of the prime mission
3911594 j ust to say how special it is in the whole universe we might be among the few beings that have the chance of seeing something like that the fact that we have a moon and that the moon passes in front of our sun and that the apparent size of our moon is approximately equal to the apparent size of the sun all these factors combine to create the solar eclipse phenomenon
3911595 w ithout habeas corpus in the united states today what we now have is a fourth reich somebody in a position of power the president the attorney general the head of homeland security can simply point a figure at you and designate you as an undesirable and hence an enemy combatant and they can grab you and imprison you and you dont even get a day in court much less a lawyer
3911596 t he one take home message for me is thatthese ice shelves arent re generating
3911597 w hen radar returns on one unknown object no transponder beeps did show up in the data from 6 51 pm to 8 00 pm on our graph it was traveling a straight line headed for crawford texas

3911599 the situation in georgia remains fluid and dangerous and as soon as possible my colleagues senator lieberman and senator graham will be traveling to georgia theyre both members of the senate armed services committee
3911600 i hope that other members of the armed services committee in the senate and they will go together and receive an assessment of the situation and what we need to do in the future to avoid further escalation and also to protect the independence and freedom of the people of this brave democratic ally the country of georgia

3911606 he said i told the nursing department im in pain but they dont believe me

3911609 imports into the republic of ireland from eu and non eu countries
3911610 i wrote a narrative about a secret double agent on a mission to destroy terrorism and make cash
3911611 be the change you wish to see in the world
3911612 things like this can happen especially in our day and time when you are accused of being a terrorist that is like being called a witch the cia and other undercover agents can do these types of things if you are involved or work with al qaeda they can bring you in and torture you you might not have anything to do with the organization but its the fact that you are accused of being a part of something so dangerous kind of like in the book you have no rights when the cia takes you in they can do whatever they want just like they were afraid of witches we are that much afraid of terrorists coming and attacking again
3911613 yes i think that this can definitely happen these days its as if every day people are falsely accused and punished for no reason for example the man on the news a few months ago was accused of killing a man in his back yard he was accused by his sister in law and they ended up finding out that he was innocent and that can definitely relate to the book because there are hateful people in this world who have nothing better to do but to accuse others and when they do that innocent people end up being punished many people may be able to do that by just going to the right people and trying to convince them that the others are wrong so yes this can definitely happen these days
3911614 hot springs arkansas hot water on the hair wash dont worry the waters not that hot and the students love it wont you join us next time
3911615 the trip to ghana is not only a trip it is a course where we actually experience the journey we will be taking classes at universities going on field trips discussing and debating just like in any other class except well be in ghana west africa and part of a life changing trip
3911616 this trip creates the perfect opportunity to continue my teaching especially on the issue of manhood
3911617 how can a current scfp student prepare now to be successful in college
3911618 i think all current scfp students are capable of succeeding in college or what ever they choose to do its just having motivation and dedication by that i mean you cant come half stepping and youve got to give it your all college requires some of the same characteristics of the freedom project but the big difference is youre on your own the biggest thing is not being side tracked by all the freedom and decisions you are in total control of making

3911620 who is that girl man shes so pretty fuck she keeps making funny jokes shit
3911621 we are appreciative of israels position of not selling offensive weapons to a conflict area
3911622 it is unrealistic for us to expect that russia will assume a constructive stance on iran even as it itself violates significant established international norms all of which suggests that the un track is well and truly dead as far as pressuring iran is concerned
3911623 the day we will want to prevent a future deal with iran our hands must be clean
3911624 the prerequisite for any movement on the un sanctions front is that moscow and washington be on speaking terms
3911625 and this has the potential to reconfigure in a very negative sense how the two sides think about each other
3911626 what happens in georgia is just a tiny part of this
3911627 what happens with missile defense installations in poland and the czech republic is probably more important my sense is that russia is sending a message it feels very hard pressed on all its western borders and it saw what georgia was doing as part of this broader campaign to whittle away at its influence over anyone on its borders
3911628 it seems to me if there is a deal with russia on iran it will come in the next administration fairly early
3911629 it will involve the united states giving up on nato membership for ukraine and georgia
3911630 the new administration has got to decide whether to go ahead with missiles defenses in eastern europe
3911631 i would move forward at the right time with the application for membership in nato by georgia as you know through nato membership if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all
3911632 its clear there are two narratives contending with each other in washington
3911633 one is that the russian bear is back and its time for the united states to double down and realize it again has a major competitor in moscow
3911634 the second narrative sees it as much more complicated it puts the onus on both georgia and russia but the complicated narrative disappears if russia goes to tblisi
3911635 protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they may be
3911636 commissioned from private israeli security firms several hundred military advisers estimated at up to 1 000 to train the georgian armed forces in commando air sea armored and artillery combat tactics
3911637 they also have been giving instruction on military intelligence and security for the central regime tbilisi also purchased weapons intelligence and electronic warfare systems from israel these advisers were undoubtedly deeply involved in the georgian armys preparations to conquer the south ossetian capital friday
3911638 moscow has repeatedly demanded that jerusalem halt its military assistance to georgia finally threatening a crisis in bilateral relations israel responded by saying that the only assistance rendered to tbilisi was defensive
3911639 jerusalem has a strong interest in having caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azerbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean

3911651 the organisation has deficiencies which impact adversely on ethnic minority solicitors
3911652 the sra at present lacks the drive and the equality and diversity competence within its managerial and leadership spheres to make the changes happen
3911653 potentially this still leaves the sra open to the charge of institutional racism as its policies procedures practices and actions however unintended can be seen to have disproportionate detrimental and discriminatory outcomes for bme black and minority ethnic solicitors
3911654 not to be under estimated is the level of prejudice and bias which exists among personnel in this and other similar organisations
3911655 black and minority solicitors faced racism this is as serious for the legal profession as the lawrence inquiry was for racism in the metropolitan police
3911656 this is a tripartite negotiating framework you cannot get an agreement where only two parties agree
3911657 the political impasse will only be broken when we have an agreement that reflects the will of the people as expressed in the march election
3911658 we are indeed convinced that it is possible to conclude these negotiations quite quickly
3911659 no i think the article set out a very clear agenda for defending the record of the government for advancing a clear vision of the future of britain
3911660 john macdougall gave more than 30 years of distinguished public service to fife as a councillor leader of the fife council convener of fife council and then mp for central fife and he will be remembered as a true servant of the people
3911661 it the bill is not the partys work but it was perceived as if it belonged to the party
3911662 such works should be discussed within the party first it is an ill timed and fatal statement the content is bad she sozen put the party in a difficult situation we are going through sensitive times that need caution and ultimate care this is valid for each one of us we all need to refrain from any actions or statements that could create new tensions
3911663 i dont think the critics will be satisfied with such a motion from the prime minister he has to show that he favours further liberalisation of the country and cares about more than just the rights of the muslim community
3911664 an assault on the countrys historical respect for the right to privacy and the freedom to be left alone
3911665 we are stunned and profoundly saddened by this loss words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of aid workers
3911666 it is not in our culture to kill women afghans never kill women
3911667 this unforgivable incident without any doubt was carried out by enemies of afghanistan by non afghans
3911668 we cannot say what motivated the attack the enemy are fanatics
3911669 i condemn this act and urge the authorities to leave no stone unturned in the search for the perpetrators
3911670 we havent seen as direct attack on the aid community as this for many years
3911671 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3911672 all the data predicts that the trend will continue and the a grade will go up by about one percentage point
3911673 fewer applicants have missed their offers that implies results have gone up the impression is were seeing fewer bs than last year so the number of as will have gone up a bit theres a general sense of it being tougher than ever with a slightly lower rate of students turning down offers as well
3911674 it will give us no room for manoeuvre for people who have missed their results because of illness or family issues or other discretionary issues
3911675 we could be up for record numbers of student who get three as who are turned down on that measure yes its tougher on the students
3911676 extended projects are an excellent way to learn skills and even better when a range of research and presentation methods can be used but trying to graft them on to an already crowded and incompatible curriculum is not the answer
3911677 people will be shocked to see there are areas of the country where fewer than one in eight children sit a levels as ever it is the poorest areas that are worst affected
3911678 people are getting better at the exams game the government sets up a system and schools and colleges try to play that system thats what they do thats what independent schools have always been particularly good at
3911679 as with every year some people will inevitably claim that a levels are getting easier but we shouldnt really take away from the hard work of those students who have done well in their results today
3911680 it is difficult to compare the a levels of today with those of 40 years ago as the world is quite a different place many world records are being broken at the olympics but that doesnt make the feat easier or the distances shorter
3911681 the real economic data is undeniable the economy is slowing really sharply and to forecast inflation below target in two years time was a huge signal
3911682 will they cut rates next month well you cant rule it out with the signal they have sent
3911683 increases in food and energy bills will intensify the squeeze on real take home pay which for many households is unlikely to grow this year
3911684 these are circumstances in which consumer spending and house prices are likely to weaken together
3911685 more pronounced slowdown in activity is likely to be necessary to contain wage and price pressures and ensure inflation expectations are anchored in the medium term
3911686 as both the government and the bank of england have recognised the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high energy and food prices we know the impact that this is having on people here and will continue to support families and business through these tougher times but the fundamentals of the uk economy remain strong the government stands behind the 2 inflation target and will continue to support the banks decisions to ensure inflation comes back to target
3911687 it is very difficult to see how a weakening government with minimal political authority is going to stagger though next year when economic conditions are deteriorating
3911688 after the inflation report what were seeing is the realisation from real money managers that theres no potential for a rate hike and that its brought forward the possibility for a rate cut leading to sterling weakness
3911689 were being told by western envoys that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
3911690 we are very clear that we have no role to play in this impeachment process britain has no interest in talking about the fate of individuals
3911691 there is a link between musharraf and the army so humiliating him is like humiliating the army
3911692 the us administration would have much preferred to see a workable political arrangement between musharraf and the government not another looming transition
3911693 whoever abrogates the constitution must be punished or we will never stop these dictators usurping power here
3911694 this is a man who stood up against al qaida who will face al qaida after musharraf certainly not this coalition
3911695 the real threat that remains almost unmentionable in western establishment circles and therefore in the media
3911696 but from age three we knew something was wrong she was very introverted isolated when she started school at four she came home and said she was a freak it seemed a strange word for a four year old to use she was always quite a sad little person
3911697 looking back we could never find any tape in the house it was because she was taping her genitals up every day she said to us later that she thought it would all go right for her at puberty that her willy would drop off and she would grow breasts she said she was going completely crazy because she knew in her head that she was a girl
3911698 she was there in front of the mirror with her genitals tucked away
3911699 i had watched programmes on transgender im very interested in people its part of who i am to find out about these things but you never imagine its going to happen to you
3911700 it was apparent he was unhappy and said he wanted to be a girl
3911701 thousands of families face raising children who step outside the pink or blue box
3911702 well say things like youre special god made you special because there arent very many little girls out there that have a penis
3911703 it usually becomes more evident when they go to school
3911704 there have been reported cases of kids who wont drink for the duration of the school day so that they dont have to go to the toilet and who dont want to sleep in a bedroom with their peers
3911705 we get 60 to 80 referrals a year and our referrals are going up we see children from as young as six up to aged 18
3911706 we get a lot of calls from parents who have five to nine year olds there seem to be more boys than girls affected at that age
3911707 which is probably because its more acceptable for girls to be tomboys if you have a little girl who wants to cut her hair short or play football that is seen as normal but if you have a boy who wants to draw mermaids or dress up as a princess they get made fun of
3911708 for others it is likely to go on for some years and will cause a lot of problems
3911709 as far as theyre concerned a trans outcome is bad they are hoping that during puberty the natural hormones themselves will act on the brain to cure these trans teenagers what we do know is what happens if you dont offer hormone blockers you are stuck with unwanted secondary sex characteristics in the long term and in the short term these teenagers end up suicidal
3911710 the only indication i did have when she was a child was that she showed an interest in female clothing not wearing it but just having some in her room i said you mustnt take your sisters clothes and then forgot about it i was completely amazed shocked and frightened when i did find out some years later what was happening but i have always felt that people have a right to be who they are i felt that whoever this person was i was her parent and i wanted to support her
3911711 we have run 11 family workshops and seen over 200 individuals in family situations i like to think that we have helped an enormous number of people to get over that first shock of rejection and sadly sometimes revulsion
3911712 when you live with it it is so obvious and so extreme some of these children are saying from a very early age this is what i am why doesnt anyone understand that my name is bob and i am not a girl sometimes its as soon as they can talk at age two or three
3911713 the uk stance on puberty suppressing drugs is completely unreasonable in other countries they are provided as soon as puberty has commenced but obtaining this treatment which suppresses oestrogen in girls and testosterone in boys is very difficult in this country
3911714 it is a temporary reversible intervention if the child changes their mind they can be interrupted they are entirely benign with no known side effects
3911715 but there are cases that are very clear where the disorder is strong and persistent
3911716 the dutch data looks promising but they have not been doing it for so many years that you have long term follow up the data is not over a long enough period of time and that concerns endocrinologists
3911717 the question is if you halt your own sex hormones so that your brain is not experiencing puberty are you in some way altering the course of nature
3911718 there is a small amount of evidence for differences in the brain
3911719 that is a very interesting finding but it is not robust enough to say that it is definitely the only reason and that it is an innate condition it is most likely multifactorial
3911720 feelings are very intense and it is very difficult for families and young people to cope with the uncertainty they are very strong in their conviction that they are in the wrong body
3911721 at her school they were shocked but they were wonderful
3911722 it was explained to all the year groups that it was a condition and not a choice they explained the effect it had on her and that bullying would not be tolerated the kids were great it was the parents saying they didnt want a freak in school with their child
3911723 it takes a long long time to come to terms with it took us about two years to stop crying for our loss and also for the pain that we knew our child was going to have to go through no one would choose this its too hard ive asked my daughter if this condition was known about in 1989 when i was pregnant and there was an option to have a termination would you have wanted me to she said yes and i agree if i had known what it would be like for her i would have done it thats how bad it is

3911737 it may not taste good that doesnt mean its going to make you sick

3911756 you know that i never endorse nor campaign for political candidates neither is it my role to give political advice but i am a cultural observer and i do understand the unique stresses and responsibilities of public leadership so i try to help leaders when asked
3911757 for many evangelical leaders rick warren is either a little too naive or a little too shrewd
3911758 he is threatening to water down the essential message of evangelical christianity
3911759 and that is what causes people to grow a little insecure and concerned and maybe even disconcerted
3911760 iphone sdk released the good the bad and the ugly

3911763 and were still sifting through information that were receiving and looking at everything thats coming in
3911764 we havent had search and rescue down in gardiners creek yesterday thats been done extensively and we dont see any more value in that
3911765 its now just a waiting game in terms of that angle of the investigation
3911766 anyone who might have a regular need to go to that park go home that way play soccer down there hopefully they might remember something if were down there
3911767 if anyone saw anything and they can assist us in any way in the investigation it would be very much appreciated because were looking for something firm to act on
3911768 but at the moment there really is a lot of people working on this investigating every possible aspect but theres no firm leads

3911786 for us having this album finally hit stores and having them sing the songs knowing that they can actually hear them and have it in their possession is the most amazing thing for us were so excited

3911795 jika suaminya berbuat baik selama setahun lalu melihat kejelekan dia berkata aku belum memperoleh kebaikan apapun darimu dengan demikian mereka kufur kepada suami dan mengingkari kebaikannya
3911796 sesungguhnya aku telah melihat surga setan dan memetik buah anggur seandainya aku mendapatkannya tentu kalian dapat memakannya selama dunia masih terbentang aku juga melihat neraka dan belum pernah melihat pemandangan yang sangat mengerikan seperti yang kulihat hari itu aku lihat kebanyakan penghuni neraka adalah perempuan
3911797 wahai saudaraku jangan dekati muhammad dia itu orang gila dia itu pembohong dia itu tukang sihir apabila kalian mendekatinya maka kalian akan dipengaruhinya

3911799 setiap pagi rasulullah selalu pergi ke ujung pasar dengan membawakan makanan untuk seorang pengemis yahudi buta yang ada di sana
3911800 apabila ia datang kepadaku tidak susah tanganku ini memegang dan tidak susah mulutku ini mengunyah orang yang biasa mendatangiku itu selalu menyuapiku tapi terlebih dahulu dihaluskannya makanan tersebut setelaqh itu baru ia berikan kepadaku
3911801 aku memang bukan orang yang biasa datang kepadamu aku adalah salah seorang dari sahabatnya orang yang mulia itu telah tiada ia adalah muhammada rasulullah saw
3911802 benarkah demikian selama ini aku selalu menghinanya memfitnahnya tapi ia tidak pernah memarahiku sedikitpun ia dengan sabar mendatangiku dengan membawa makanan setiap pagi ia begitu mulia
3911803 ya rasulullah adakah suatu kaum yang lebih besar pahalanya dari kami padahal kami beriman kepadamu dan kami pun mengikutimu dalam berjuang
3911804 apakah halangan kamu untuk beriman kepadaku sedang rasulullah ada dihadapan kamu kamu pun menyaksikan langsung bagaimana wahyu diturunkan dari langit tetapi akan ada suatu kaum yang datang sesudahmu dating kepada mereka kitab allah yang ditulis di antara dua luh mereka pun beriman kepadaku mereka juga mengamalkan apa yang tersebut di dalamnya mereka itulah yang lebih besar pahalanya dari kamu sekalian
3911805 beruntung berbahagia bagi siapa yang menemui melihatku dan beriman kepadaku beruntung bagi yang tidak pernah menemuiku tapi ia beriman kepadaku ia mengulanginya tujuh kali

3911829 if we had no news division it would be important to show that speech
3911830 theres no telling when it will happen again it certainly hasnt happened before
3911831 its important for our viewers to be able to see both sides
3911832 hi my name is monica kramer and i am a junior here
3911833 we have a very high percentage of baby boomers who will hit 65 in the next three or four years and then keep hitting 65
3911834 significantly underestimates the number of deaths because we dont actually take any other areas where air pollution does cause cancer in other areas of the body
3911835 that is a huge hit and huge burden upon our health care system
3911836 is it taking doctors attentions away from other issues that are otherwise being missed or ignored
3911837 the numbers to me were not a surprise they were consistent with others numbers id heard
3911838 doy gracias al se or por su vida ya que a travez de su estudio se reaviva un poco mas mi fe en la biblia tengo una pregunta referente al antiguo testamento por que el antiguo testamento es tan sangriento lleno de masacres de beb s mujeres ni os y ancianos llevadas a cabo por israel en nombre de dios no es esto una antimoral a todos los valores cristianos usted lo har a si dios se lo pidiese matar a bebes con un cuchillo creo en jesucristo creo en dios y creo en el esp ritu santo asisto a la iglesia todos los domingos y oro continuamente pero no quiero creer en un dios lleno de sed de sangre como el dios del antiguo testamento he orado pero no encuentro paz interior en este asunto dios le bendiga por su ayuda
3911839 entonces jehov dijo a abram ten por cierto que tu descendencia morar en tierra ajena y ser esclava all y ser oprimida cuatrocientos a os mas tambi n a la naci n a la cual servir n juzgar yo y despu s de esto saldr n con gran riqueza y t vendr s a tus padres en paz y ser s sepultado en buena vejez y en la cuarta generaci n volver n ac porque a n no ha llegado a su colmo la maldad del amorreo hasta aqu
3911840 entonces los hijos de israel entraron por en medio del mar en seco teniendo las aguas como muro a su derecha y a su izquierda y sigui ndolos los egipcios entraron tras ellos hasta la mitad del mar toda la caballer a de fara n sus carros y su gente de a caballo aconteci a la vigilia de la ma ana que jehov mir el campamento de los egipcios desde la columna de fuego y nube y trastorn el campamento de los egipcios y quit las ruedas de sus carros y los trastorn gravemente entonces los egipcios dijeron huyamos de delante de israel porque jehov pelea por ellos contra los egipcios y jehov dijo a mois s extiende tu mano sobre el mar para que las aguas vuelvan sobre los egipcios sobre sus carros y sobre su caballer a entonces mois s extendi su mano sobre el mar y cuando amanec a el mar se volvi en toda su fuerza y los egipcios al huir se encontraban con el mar y jehov derrib a los egipcios en medio del mar y volvieron las aguas y cubrieron los carros y la caballer a y todo el ej rcito de fara n que hab a entrado tras ellos en el mar no qued de ellos ni uno y los hijos de israel fueron por en medio del mar en seco teniendo las aguas por muro a su derecha y a su izquierda as salv jehov aquel d a a israel de mano de los egipcios e israel vio a los egipcios muertos a la orilla del mar y vio israel aquel grande hecho que jehov ejecut contra los egipcios y el pueblo temi a jehov y creyeron a jehov y a mois s su siervo
3911841 entonces el pueblo grit y los sacerdotes tocaron las bocinas y aconteci que cuando el pueblo hubo o do el sonido de la bocina grit con gran vocer o y el muro se derrumb el pueblo subi luego a la ciudad cada uno derecho hacia adelante y la tomaron y destruyeron a filo de espada todo lo que en la ciudad hab a hombres y mujeres j venes y viejos hasta los bueyes las ovejas y los asnos

3911843 porque la ira de dios se revela desde el cielo contra toda impiedad e injusticia de los hombres que detienen con injusticia la verdad porque lo que de dios se conoce les es manifiesto pues dios se lo manifest porque las cosas invisibles de l su eterno poder y deidad se hacen claramente visibles desde la creaci n del mundo siendo entendidas por medio de las cosas hechas de modo que no tienen excusa pues habiendo conocido a dios no le glorificaron como a dios ni le dieron gracias sino que se envanecieron en sus razonamientos y su necio coraz n fue entenebrecido profesando ser sabios se hicieron necios y cambiaron la gloria del dios incorruptible en semejanza de imagen de hombre corruptible de aves de cuadr pedos y de reptiles por lo cual tambi n dios los entreg a la inmundicia en las concupiscencias de sus corazones de modo que deshonraron entre s sus propios cuerpos ya que cambiaron la verdad de dios por la mentira honrando y dando culto a las criaturas antes que al creador el cual es bendito por los siglos am n
3911844 porque la escritura dice a fara n para esto mismo te he levantado para mostrar en ti mi poder y para que mi nombre sea anunciado por toda la tierra de manera que de quien quiere tiene misericordia y al que quiere endurecer endurece pero me dir s por qu pues inculpa porque qui n ha resistido a su voluntad mas antes oh hombre qui n eres t para que alterques con dios dir el vaso de barro al que lo form por qu me has hecho as o no tiene potestad el alfarero sobre el barro para hacer de la misma masa un vaso para honra y otro para deshonra y qu si dios queriendo mostrar su ira y hacer notorio su poder soport con mucha paciencia los vasos de ira preparados para destrucci n y para hacer notorias las riquezas de su gloria las mostr para con los vasos de misericordia que l prepar de antemano para gloria
3911845 todos los habitantes de la tierra son considerados como nada y l hace seg n su voluntad en el ej rcito del cielo y en los habitantes de la tierra y no hay quien detenga su mano y le diga qu haces
3911846 no os vengu is vosotros mismos amados m os sino dejad lugar a la ira de dios porque escrito est m a es la venganza yo pagar dice el se or
3911847 por si quiz dios les conceda que se arrepientan para conocer la verdad y escapen del lazo del diablo en que est n cautivos a voluntad de l
3911848 y vi a la bestia a los reyes de la tierra y a sus ej rcitos reunidos para guerrear contra el que montaba el caballo y contra su ej rcito y la bestia fue apresada y con ella el falso profeta que hab a hecho delante de ella las se ales con las cuales hab a enga ado a los que recibieron la marca de la bestia y hab an adorado su imagen estos dos fueron lanzados vivos dentro de un lago de fuego que arde con azufre y los dem s fueron muertos con la espada que sal a de la boca del que montaba el caballo y todas las aves se saciaron de las carnes de ellos

3911853 the wishes of john steinbeck related to ownership of his literary works have been validated
3911854 the wishes of john steinbeck related to ownership of his literary works have been validated
3911855 the writer dic edwards and the composer keith burstein presented a complex view of the motivations ambitions and doubts of those attracted to suicide bombing
3911856 unsurprisingly burstein took the reviewer to mean that he was glorifying terrorists and thus once the terrorism act 2006 came into force at risk of prosecution should the opera be revived
3911857 we referred to a composer as being accused of promoting terrorism we should have made clear that this was the meaning the composer keith burstein ascribed to a review of his opera the court of appeal did not accept that the review conveyed this meaning and ruled that this conclusion could be reached only by a strained interpretation
3911858 for us in venezuela everything is new and every time we play something it is also like the last time this is how i grew up

3911863 this acquisition is another building block in nortels vision to be a software centric company and the leading provider of unified communications solutions
3911864 we believe that bringing pingtels critical r amp d capabilities in house will enable us to further develop software based solutions that go beyond the boundaries of our previous original equipment manufacturer relationship
3911865 spamming is now done by organized crime using local gangs who know how to target customers and how to make their spam look legitimate
3911866 the type of e mail messages are now more dangerous there are now more fraud e mail messages rather than just spam offering you viagra
3911867 orange takes e mail spam very seriously we are an active member of the messaging anti abuse working group and deploy a mixture of proprietary and third party antispam filtering software which we provide free to all our customers
3911868 with any automatic filtering there is a danger of it identifying e mail that the customer actually wants to see therefore we choose to tag the spam and deliver it to the inbox and make it a choice for the customer to turn on their antispam settings via their webmail to deliver the tagged e mail to the junk folder
3911869 it tends to go in cycles who they target with gangs tending to target the banks with most publicity they will go for the biggest banks because theres so many more customers who are likely to click on an e mail
3911870 this research simply doesnt reflect our experience its an unreliable snapshot and rbs didnt even feature in their previous table for quarter one of this year
3911871 we have developed significant security processes to protect against this type of threat including sending more than two million card reader devices to our customers with the specific purpose of protecting them from online fraud such as phishing
3911872 if bad guy is along route a to destination take route b instead
3911873 although the impact on their web sites is clear i believe this may end up being just some kids who got overexcited with georgia being ill prepared to say the least
3911874 while georgia is obviously under a ddos attacks and it is political in nature it doesnt so far seem different than any other online aftermath by fans political tensions are always followed by online attacks by sympathizers
3911875 compared to the may 2007 estonian attacks these are more intense but have lasted so far for less time this could be due to a number of factors including more sizable botnets with more bandwidth better bandwidth at the victims changes in our observations or other factors
3911876 ethanol is bad for taxpayers bad for the environment and horrible for the worlds poor
3911877 we are in the midst of a world food crisis several million people are on the edge of starvation because we are turning food into fuel the amount of corn that it takes to produce a 20 gallon tank of ethanol could feed one person for an entire year

3911880 i am prepared to take on datuk seri anwar ibrahim the parti keadilan rakyat candidate
3911881 he may be popular but i am not afraid of him i will be the giant killer this time
3911882 the aca is not a tool for any individual to use to topple anyone
3911883 he is trying to portray this negative image of the aca and i think it is wrong if he is not guilty then he should cooperate with the aca in their investigation
3911884 why fear if there is no wrongdoing on his part
3911885 my request is for him not to undermine the aca its integrity and capabilities aca officers are highly trained and they know what they are doing
3911886 let them investigate if there is no wrongdoing then you are free do not release your emotions and feelings by saying there is a political agenda
3911887 until now the aca has yet to officially call me up for questioning or for my statements to be recorded
3911888 the truth will prevail i dont know how far they those who made the allegations can go as far as i am concerned this is all politically motivated
3911889 this special cookbook represents some of our chefs best and favorite creations the kinds of dishes they prepare for their friends and family

3911891 it is reasonable looking at the amount of the alleged bribe involved and mirzas position as a senior government officer
3911892 he has an exemplary record and is respected not only in malaysia but also abroad
3911893 i assure all of you that i will give my best to help bn win the seat back it has been nine years since someone living kuala lumpur has been representing the people of permatang pauh
3911894 it is time for us to have our own anak permatang pauh to represent us
3911895 we have a big mission to transform this nation thats why we need this political support
3911896 we will make malaysia a great nation thats the bn promise
3911897 we will not do anything that will not be fair to him
3911898 we still prefer to be the underdogs and take on pakatan rakyat like david going against goliath
3911899 the truth is he cannot do so by just winning the permatang pauh by election
3911900 i am the bn chief whip and i have not heard about any mps preparing to leapfrog to his side
3911901 we discussed the campaign guidelines and stressed the need for full support for the bn candidate

3911921 police also released details of two phone calls that came into the gt gt incident room in both bradford and northumbria within a week of the gt gt murder of barbara leach in bradford they claimed that a man phoned in gt gt to both stations in a frenzy and claimed that the letters were a hoax gt gt the calls were recorded by police manning the phones now chris gregg gt gt says that this was john humble who was repentant and attempted to warn gt gt police that the letters were a hoax gt gt however in the independant newspaper the reporter had taken the gt gt trouble to delve further into it and found that the police forensic gt gt laboratory had eliminated this voice as being the im jack author gt gt shortly after it was made this means that that person could not have gt gt been john humble and the police laboratory eliminated him then gt gt this information in fact undermines the case against john humble based gt gt on police evidence that chris gregg appears to have overlooked in gt gt fabricating the confession and conviction of humble

3911925 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3911926 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it started setting in a little bit after the butterfly i was just trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3911927 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3911928 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3911929 there is nobody in our sport that can win like he wins
3911930 he is not just winning he is crunching world records
3911931 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3911932 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3911933 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3911934 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3911935 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3911936 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well
3911937 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3911938 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3911939 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3911940 we only have two practices left before the game and we do monitor that stuff
3911941 you guys talked to him more than i did so i dont really know where he is with that
3911942 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3911943 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
3911944 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
3911945 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
3911946 i think you can ask the receivers he still has it
3911947 but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3911948 i said look i heard youre not talking to the media
3911949 he said its not that its not that i obviously was joking on that i said look im not here to take chads spot or replace him or whatever it is what it is
3911950 i said this the other day i dont think ive ever beaten chad
3911951 i did tell eric on the phone the day before i came up i said hey i want to play as soon as possible
3911952 i wouldve played three plays the other night at cleveland but that wouldve been ugly i dont know i think well just play it by ear
3911953 when i grow up i want to be either a nun or a boy scout master
3911954 life is a series of pulls back and forth you want to do one thing but you are bound to do something else something hurts you yet you know it shouldnt you take certain things for granted even when you know you should never take anything for granted
3911955 a tension of opposites like a pull on a rubber band and most of us live somewhere in the middle
3911956 perhaps after these games it will be clear they will be the only outliers and have to allow women to compete
3911957 id be surprised and disappointed if we took such draconian action
3911958 all that would do is have the athletes of that country suffer
3911959 i dont think that can be considered parallel to the effort to bring women into absolutely equal gender balance
3911960 the entire gulf region and the whole arab world everyone man and woman should simply work hard at their sport there are no limits at all
3911961 i want the other women to watch me and see me and follow me
3911962 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
3911963 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3911964 well beyond anything that is needed to protect russian peacekeepers
3911965 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
3911966 the united states has supported those efforts now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3911967 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
3911968 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react

3911970 there are confused reports and varying reports that are coming in
3911971 its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
3911972 i definitely thought i had come back after the second round
3911973 i thought i was up by one point i was confident i could get through i had a good draw i cant complain though thats just the way it goes
3911974 not only a strong chairman of but he is also a cherished friend and confidante
3911975 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3911976 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3911977 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3911978 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3911979 they sat down and began talking to afghan officials not realising she was there unrestrained one of the officers put a rifle down she picked it up and pointed it
3911980 the interpreter lunged at her she fired off some rounds a took a sidearm and returned fire and shot her in the abdomen
3911981 ambulatory and were she a soldier with like condition would have been returned to limited duty
3911982 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3911983 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

3911987 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3911988 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3911989 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3911990 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3911991 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3911992 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3911993 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3911994 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3911995 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3911996 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3911997 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3911998 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

3912001 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3912002 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

3912006 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3912007 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3912008 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche

3912018 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3912019 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3912020 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3912021 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3912022 the brain is not an organ the poor are authorised to use

3912028 we wanted to hear their stories get some expert advice and inspire some disruptive thinking
3912029 im one of those people who often spends his nights dreaming up inventions and ideas but never really seeing them through
3912030 there is a uk disease we are fearful of failure i fail every day of the week
3912031 if enough people want to steal something from you theyll find a way to do it and the law wont protect you
3912032 nothing will ever change unless you make that decision to do something
3912033 you have to get it done dont have meetings after meetings make decisions and act on them
3912034 i was honest so be absolutely honest warts and all and ask the dumb question

3912039 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3912040 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3912041 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3912042 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3912043 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3912044 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3912045 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3912046 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3912047 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3912048 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3912049 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3912050 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3912051 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3912052 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3912053 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3912054 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3912055 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3912056 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3912057 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3912058 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3912059 design and develop creative and innovative media campaigns for police recruitment and support staff
3912060 given the current economic climate in the uk and the strain of day to day living and working many people are now looking at property abroad as an investment or even as a chance to start afresh abroad
3912061 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3912062 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3912063 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3912064 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3912065 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3912066 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3912067 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3912068 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3912069 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3912070 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3912071 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3912072 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3912073 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3912074 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3912075 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3912076 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3912077 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3912078 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3912079 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3912080 its always fun you kind of get that excited feeling the night before almost feel like its a game type atmosphere because there is some unexpectedness were back at our home facility and thats nice being able to step out on these fields which look as good as theyve ever looked is nice its nice to be back in new orleans and to be able to come and be able to compete against another team
3912081 it has been a good year for us and once in a while a client with a new take on something comes along and gets you fired up
3912082 we could see the potential for growth in what was essentially a modest start up

3912105 we are not going to act precipitously or recklessly this is public money
3912106 i am concerned that over the next say six months we will probably see a lot of people moving out of the area
3912107 this is a problem for the local community because youre going to see workers and their families leave the community if they cant get jobs and employment into the future
3912108 so the question is how long will it take for these payments to kick in into this community
3912109 this community could have run its own sawmill and provided really long term decent futures and career paths for people who have got a commitment in the timber industry now

3912136 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3912137 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3912138 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales

3912141 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3912142 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3912143 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3912144 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3912145 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3912146 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3912147 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3912148 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3912149 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3912150 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3912151 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3912152 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3912153 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3912154 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
3912155 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3912156 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3912157 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3912158 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3912159 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

3912169 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3912170 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3912171 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3912172 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3912173 contra el saqueo y la contaminaci n por la soberania alimentaria
3912174 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3912175 well be looking at the effects of the earthquake on the ground and for evidence of what actually happened during the earthquake well be looking very closely at how the tectonic blocks actually moved in relation to each other
3912176 much of what actually happens during earthquakes is difficult to view because it occurs deep below the surface by looking at the way in which roads pipelines rivers and other man made markers are affected we can map out how the earth moved what faults were responsible and what kind of activity we might expect in future events
3912177 aftershocks are expected after every large earthquake and this has been no exception earthquakes release stress where they occur but they also cause increased stress in the surrounding rock and this additional pressure has to be released peak aftershock activity is generally in the first few days after the main quake and the number and size of aftershocks decreases rapidly after that
3912178 we are conscious of being as sensitive as possible while working in this area there is still a lot of recovery work going on and there are obvious long term infrastructural problems we hope to be able to visit the town of beichuan which was decimated by the earthquake but this will depend very much on the local authorities were very thankful to the sichuan provincial government for granting us access to the earthquake zone at such a critical time the location of the active faults is crucial we want to see if the faults that weve previously mapped were activated during the earthquake or if the quake occurred along a new set of faults knowing where the active faults lie and how much they are likely to move in future events can help the chinese authorities in planning new buildings and towns to reduce the likelihood of future casualties

3912212 lord have pity on my son for he is a lunatic and suffers severely often he falls into fire and often into water 16i brought him to your disciples but they could not cure him
3912213 o faithless and perverse generation how long will i be with you how long will i endure you bring him here to me
3912214 because of your little faith amen i say to you if you have faith the size of a mustard seed you will say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move nothing will be impossible for you

3912225 lord if my brother sins against me how often must i forgive him as many as seven times
3912226 i say to you not seven times but seventy seven times 23that is why the kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants 24when he began the accounting a debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount 25since he had no way of paying it back his master ordered him to be sold along with his wife his children and all his property in payment of the debt 26at that the servant fell down did him homage and said be patient with me and i will pay you back in full 27moved with compassion the master of that servant let him go and forgave him the loan 28when that servant had left he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a much smaller amount he seized him and started to choke him demanding pay back what you owe 29falling to his knees his fellow servant begged him be patient with me and i will pay you back 30but he refused instead he had him put in prison until he paid back the debt 31now when his fellow servants saw what had happened they were deeply disturbed and went to their master and reported the whole affair 32his master summoned him and said to him you wicked servant i forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to 33should you not have had pity on your fellow servant as i had pity on you 34then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers until he should pay back the whole debt 35so will my heavenly father do to you unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart

3912253 theres a stereotype that students from east l a dont want to finish high school and it was a chance to show everyone that we do want to go to college
3912254 we need more to be done we cannot let this lack of effective implementation continue
3912255 instead of things moving forward they seemed to have moved back hes probably going to have to do the same things i did
3912256 the students were saying set higher expectations for us and ill meet them
3912257 it was a huge deal probably one of the most important policy shifts in the district
3912258 theres a stereotype that students in east l a dont want to finish high school and go to college but we do we just dont have the resources

3912266 the bubbling up of minorities that were now seeing at the younger ages will continue to move up through the age range through the teenage years the working age years and then the housing buying years
3912267 the child population is really a microcosm of the future
3912268 you cannot necessarily predict that just because theyll become majority minority all these schools will become low income

3912292 it has been a difficult week in many respects but it has happened very early in my tenure and from this point onwards we can move on and work much better
3912293 there have been misunderstandings but its also true to say that in any organisation if you make big changes on occasions messages will be misinterpreted and mistakes will be made
3912294 i had a meeting with the players to make the group aware that im in charge and will make the decisions that affect the players
3912295 if players leave or if they go that decision will be mine and mine solely thats where we are and i think everybody understands now that that is the situation i think we will be better for it and we can now move forward
3912296 we cant really go into the details of the owners position because if we are truthful we dont know which way it is going to go
3912297 but i was aware of this situation before i came here
3912298 it has taken a long time to get here but im happy that my future at chelsea has now been sorted and that i will be staying here for the next five years
3912299 i pride myself on my fitness and on how much effort i put in during training and for those reasons feel this could be the best five years of my career
3912300 i want to win more trophies and certainly feel i can do that here this is a great club with a great squad and where the morale is as high as ive ever experienced after winning nothing last season all the players really have the bit between their teeth this year i think we can not only win things domestically but also in europe
3912301 what the lads did at the united match was very emotional i sat and watched that with my family and it is something none of us will never forget
3912302 i cant speak highly enough of them nor the fans who sent me loads of letters after what happened in my private life they have been fantastic throughout my time here and hopefully i can repay them on the pitch
3912303 all were focusing on at the moment is the fact we will be keeping frank lampard for the next five years
3912304 he is one of the best midfielders in europe and could well turn out to be our best signing of the summer
3912305 assistant referees are not getting properly rewarded for the arduous and difficult job they do
3912306 their remuneration lags well behind that of assistant referees elsewhere in europe
3912307 even if the claim was met in full we would be talking about rewards that are considerably lower than many other parts of europe when were talking about the premier league being the richest league in the world
3912308 we have had cases where select group assistants have been on the line in the freezing cold and are soaking wet and while the referee is getting into a new clean dry shirt at half time the assistant is shivering because they will provide them with only one of each of the three coloured shirts the pgmo are saying we are negotiating so you can get the shirts at cost basically theyre having to pay for their own kit
3912309 officials fees are a matter for the pgmo not the premier league
3912310 while not being recession proof football is to a certain extent recession resistant
3912311 football is a special thing it gets people through the working week and fans will give up a lot of things before they let go of their season tickets
3912312 theres a waiting list but when i tried to get on it i was told the list is closed because theyve just got too many applicants
3912313 english football fans are among the most loyal sets of consumers in the world our clubs know this and in their greed theyll exploit it but they arent thinking about the long term future good of the game its a mistake to just look at the numbers of season tickets being sold and think everythings healthy for instance i think that while people may not give up season tickets they will economise by not going to cup games
3912314 season ticket holders today are very different from those of 15 or even 10 years ago their age and affluence is going up the average age of a premier league season ticket holder is now 44 and a recent survey showed that only around 9 can be classified as working class that figure used to be around 75 80 and the average age was much younger season ticket prices have gone up by an average of 7 2 this summer but its a completely short term strategy a whole generation is being priced out of premier league football a lot of young people are growing up without ever having experienced live games
3912315 the atmosphere is declining if not dying at many matches its not as vibrant as it used to be and that is not what the television companies who fund our clubs want
3912316 by doing this newcastle are acknowledging the game has a problem
3912317 the noisy corner would have been totally unnecessary a few years ago
3912318 eu juro que eu sou um camundongo eu juro que sou um camundongo

3912330 avoiding unnecessary antibiotic use reduces not only the public health threat of antibiotic resistance but also the risk of drug related adverse events in individual patients
3912331 more than one half of the estimated 100 million antibiotic prescriptions written in the community each year for respiratory tract infections may be unnecessary
3912332 decreasing inappropriate antibiotic use by even a small percentage could substantially reduce the number of patients who experience antibiotic associated adverse events
3912333 clearly finger wagging in the medical literature is not working
3912334 the article by shehab et al is part of increasing evidence that antibiotic therapy is associated with greater risk than was previously appreciated
3912335 for most acute respiratory tract infections antimicrobial resistance is irrelevant for an individual patient the risks are greater than the benefits and the discussion should stop there
3912336 antibiotics for treatment of acute respiratory tract infections decreasing benefit increasing risk and the irrelevance of antimicrobial resistance

3912339 radiology ophthalmology anesthesiology dermatology the specialties all the students are trying to get into now because of the pay and the lifestyle
3912340 it was in the paper a few weeks or maybe it was a few months ago
3912341 i can see why students would be attracted to a flexible lifestyle and to anesthesia once they get to know it its a great specialty but i wouldnt call it an easy one ive heard some anesthesiologists say they dont think what we do is all that hard but i actually think it can be very challenging
3912342 i think it can be really tough sometimes to protect someones life we have to think fast and act fast and make judgment calls that can be hard i think everyone finds it highly stressful at one point or another
3912343 im going to step in and take a look all right
3912344 i am truly sorry i yelled for quiet like that but i didnt feel like i had time for more than a word or two right at that moment
3912345 and i had to move on to the other o r s right away and then to the other phone line after you called because there was a lot going on
3912346 the writer dic edwards and the composer keith burstein presented a complex view of the motivations ambitions and doubts of those attracted to suicide bombing
3912347 unsurprisingly burstein took the reviewer to mean that he was glorifying terrorists and thus once the terrorism act 2006 came into force at risk of prosecution should the opera be revived
3912348 we referred to a composer as being accused of promoting terrorism we should have made clear that this was the meaning the composer keith burstein ascribed to a review of his opera the court of appeal did not accept that the review conveyed this meaning and ruled that this conclusion could be reached only by a strained interpretation
3912349 it is time to stop pretending that there is a bright future for sunderland

3912351 what can have an impact on the russians without damaging us more than them
3912352 we are excited to bring the junior pga championship to a venue like tpc rivers bend
3912353 the level of competition will be high and junior ryder cup spots are up for grabs so we are expecting a great championship
3912354 i am surprised if i was in their position i would be playing
3912355 its hard to criticize them at this point though because if they come out the next two weeks and make the side then it was a great decision not to play here
3912356 but if they dont make the side they will be kicking themselves
3912357 i think nicks going to pick ian poulter if he has to because of his second place at the open and if paul casey is playing decently you would definitely pick him
3912358 id be surprised if nick went for monty though from what ive heard wild cards go to players in form and paul mcginley told me that the last thing you want is to go to a ryder cup playing badly
3912359 so many times in my career weve left a classic traditional golf course and gone to a new modern style course
3912360 so its nice to be doing the opposite for once
3912361 any time you get to play a donald ross course its a treat
3912362 so hopefully word will spread to the players that this is a great golf course a fun place to play and it will help the tournament out thats no 1 helping the tournament out
3912363 im in a position where i need to play well
3912364 i would be here because i thought it was a good year to support the event when they were changing venues and they needed that support
3912365 its not very long so you dont really need to hit drivers every hole its a tight enough golf course where you can enjoy it as well it requires attention and theres a lot of tricky holes out there its got a lot of variety
3912366 it was very instrumental in my development as a player
3912367 it helped me get over that hump of playing with the top tier players on tour and really feeling like i belong out here its hard for a rookie to find unless you do it
3912368 everyone has their own opinion of what i should do but i think that its my life
3912369 i know there might be wrong decisions that i make and there might be right decisions that i make but theyre decisions that i make for myself
3912370 and i think the only decision i can make is to be 100 percent supportive of myself and not doubt myself at all
3912371 i think planning whats going to happen next year or this fall is going to happen after this week right now all im thinking about is how am i going to play good this week how am i maybe going to possibly win this
3912372 im not going to think about the future right now
3912373 i kind of feel sad for the guidance that she seems to not have in the right direction if she wants to be a golfer she should really concentrate on the being on the womens tour and dealing with them and learning to win
3912374 if i will come back in the future i guess time will tell
3912375 i never used the r word that gave me an opening but i dont have a timeframe i have a lot on my plate and im excited about the next chapter
3912376 if i thought i couldnt make it i wouldnt be playing at the moment including this my heads not where it needs to be and my golf games not where it needs to be
3912377 with spore were looking way outside the game space such as tv movies etc

3912428 theyre great for their intended uses but theyre not for everyone
3912429 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3912430 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3912431 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3912432 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3912433 so many people are being hurt by these high gas prices and it just caught america by surprise they just werent ready for these adjustments that need to be made
3912434 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions

3912443 is garnering more support from his base including republicans and white evangelical protestants than he was in june and he also has steadily gained backing from white working class voters over this period
3912444 has made gains on his leadership image an even greater percentage of voters than in june now see mccain as the candidate who would use the best judgment in a crisis and an increasing percentage see him as the candidate who can get things done
3912445 dramatic turns of event could still spell unexpected trouble or prosperity for either candidate in florida or elsewhere but for now obama simply isnt ginning up quite enough support in florida to turn all eyes to the state as the tiebreaker in november the likely reason is demographics
3912446 hes on third base but so far he cant seem to find a way to get home look at the underlying trends the economy is a huge issue bushs ratings are terrible but too many voters are concerned about obamas experience and dont yet have enough confidence in his ability to lead
3912447 among the better educated there is movement to obama among the less educated there is erosion in obamas support blacks continue to vote 10 1 obama whites continue to vote 2 1 mccain obama continues to lead 5 4 among the less affluent mccain continues to lead 5 4 among the more affluent among men mccain led by 20 points four weeks ago leads by 9 today among women obama led by 7 points four weeks ago leads by 2 today a then 27 point gender gap is now 11 points
3912448 independent voters go 45 for sen obama and 42 for sen mccain men also give the democrat a slight edge 48 to 45 while women back obama 53 to 38 mccain leads 50 to 42 among white voters obama leads 66 to 28 among voters 18 to 34 years old and 51 to 42 among voters 35 to 54 as mccain has a 47 to 44 edge with voters over 55 years old
3912449 of the 18 faith groups identified in the polls mccain is only leading among evangelicals and its a narrow lead obama leads among the other 17 faith groups identified including the born again vote barna notes that would mark the first time in more than two decades that the born again vote has swung toward the democratic candidate
3912450 the welcome news is that the numbers on incapacity benefits and lone parent benefit continue to fall as our reforms kick in
3912451 over 75s are facing a rate of inflation 43 per cent higher than the official rate of inflation which is currently 4 4 per cent mainly due to rising utilities and food costs which have soared over the past year
3912452 as the cost of living is on the up these figures even if they are only part reflective of pensioners as a whole are of real concern
3912453 this is not just a case of a small purchase this is thousands of pounds for a house that we are talking about
3912454 a small debt produces a debtor a large one an enemy

3912456 i was thrown on the ground and noticed only the stalks of my flowers were left everything was still and quiet and when i got up there were people naked not saying anything some of them had no skin or hair i was certain i was dead
3912457 even without the atomic bombing attacks air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
3912458 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
3912459 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
3912460 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
3912461 john mccain has been accused of stealing policy ideas from wikipedia which is ridiculous
3912462 im going to want somebody who shares a vision of the country where we need to go that weve got to fundamentally change not only our policies but how our politics work how business is done in washington
3912463 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
3912464 i will be glad to consider proposals to help the auto industry including investing in pure research and development
3912465 the country has implemented far reaching political economic and military reforms and should enter nato georgia is americas best friend and russian peacekeepers should be thrown out
3912466 there are lots of problems with the river murray but lack of environmental flows is without a doubt the biggest one we need to have much bigger environmental flows passing down there through the coorong and out the mouth a healthy river should be able to keep its own mouth open and shouldnt need any sort of dredging or artificial assistance in keeping sand out of its mouth
3912467 australian rivers fall rapidly from the mountains in which they originate into a level and extremely depressed country having weak and inconsiderable sources and being almost wholly unaided by tributaries of any kind they naturally fail before they reach the coast and exhaust themselves in marshes or lakes or reach it so weakened as to be unable to preserve clear or navigable mouths or to remove the sand banks that the tide throws up before them
3912468 we had at length arrived at the termination of the murray immediately below me was a beautiful lake which appeared to be a fitting reservoir for the noble stream that had led us to it and which was now ruffled by the breeze that swept over it
3912469 the transition from fresh to salt water was almost immediate
3912470 the stillness of the night was broken by the roar of the ocean now too near to be mistaken for wind or by the silvery and melancholy note of the black swans as they passed over us to seek food no doubt among the slimy weeds at the head of the lake
3912471 shoals again closed in upon us on every side we dragged the boat over several and at last got amongst quicksands
3912472 isnt it true that in exchange for your testimony today you are receiving a sentence modification
3912473 no the state has not promised me any modification i am doing this out of the goodwill that overflows from within my heart
3912474 you dont expect to receive any consideration from the state in exchange for your testimony
3912475 there is a perception at present that banks are not offering mortgages in fact our latest study suggests that access to finance is not a major issue
3912476 instead many buyers are taking a wait and see attitude naturally some feel uncomfortable buying a home which may be worth less in six months time
3912477 almost one in four buyers think they might struggle to get a mortgage however just one in fifty has actually given up on their purchase due to failing to find a suitable loan

3912483 colleges cant come watch you play because we cant start the season
3912484 this is a situation that could be overcome and the school board could work through it but theyve chosen not to
3912485 the schools are closed because of the director of schools
3912486 but the reason were not in school is because we dont have the funding it takes to run what we did last year
3912487 with this you dont know when its going to happen and as soon as they say we can go back to school were just going to be thrown back in the middle of the season

3912493 now its a beautiful mural that the kids are taking part in it communities have taken part the businesses have taken part its a win win situation for everyone
3912494 there is more business u street is changing so were actually a part of the change by doing this mural right here so its evolution of u street
3912495 graffiti is an artform like any artform and this is giving them the time to do it and do it right and really learn about the history of graffiti
3912496 if you want to be known you want to be known for something good even though at the time it was illegal i still wanted the quality of the work to be good
3912497 there is a lot of graffiti artists that make a living out of doing graffiti we are trying to make these kids change their mind set to go away from illegal things they dont have to make the same mistakes i made they can start ahead of what i started

3912500 were here to help people take their location to the web by giving them the ability to control how much detail about their location they want to share and which applications they want to share it with
3912501 fire eagle allowed us to easily add location data to pownce using their simple api
3912502 i like the stuff in it a lot of the folders are hannah montana and thats my favorite person
3912503 anything we can do to help relieve the expense to parents is a huge gift thats why were really excited about this
3912504 we were really nervous considering how much rain this areas been getting so we have had a lot of sleepless nights in anticipation but since weve arrived the weathers been pretty good
3912505 nothing i could afford they were 1 000 for a three bedroom they were small and not kept up very well
3912506 i would think that there are private sector people in the community who say gee is there a need for a small shop or grocery
3912507 we live in a mobile home now the girls share a room and now they will have their own room plenty of room im excited about moving in
3912508 boy this stuff is deteriorating quickly so thats how we finally caught on to it
3912509 i was shocked at how nonchalant he pulled in and didnt seem too worried about getting caught
3912510 we were amazed that someone had the courage to keep coming back
3912511 this has been an unprecedented run in steel and all metals and commodities ive never seen it come close in 38 years to the last three years
3912512 with a load of scrap metal you dont know where it comes from
3912513 if it wasnt for our neighbors having this camera we never would have caught this guy
3912514 i think we need to use the jacques case as a way of learning and examining our procedures
3912515 and i think the recommendations im putting forward today reflect some evolution in my thinking based on what im hearing from law enforcement and victims advocates as to the most effective ways to keep our communities safe
3912516 in light of the jacques case which has brought you here to talk about this is there anything that you look back on in your record and wish you had done differently or law you have passed or a law you wish you had passed
3912517 what im focused on is looking forward and how to bring leadership to vermont to make sure our communities can be assured to be safe
3912518 those ideas have been on the table before the real question is her record on the issue of community safety
3912519 but vermonters want action weve had hearings for years on all of these topics its time to act
3912520 at this point my focus is on how do we move forward to make sure to keep our communities safe
3912521 the telltale sign that people want to look for on ash is the exit hole
3912522 so then youve lost all your native insects that would be dropping in
3912523 is a very large insect that bores into the tree and kills the tree
3912524 its preferred host is maple so between the ash and maple were really concerned about these insects
3912525 he thought that he had never known such gallantry as the gallantry of scarlett ohara going forth to conquer the world in her mothers velvet curtains and the tail feathers of a rooster
3912526 martin brinegar was 21 and a strapping 180 pounder when he married carolina joines a shy girl of 17 back in 1877 with the help of neighbors they raised this cabin fashioning its sturdy beams and boards from the woods around them
3912527 i have no problems with them thank the lord for that
3912528 this long journey that i feel i was meant to be on
3912529 its not up to me its up to the man upstairs
3912530 im ok as of right now thats all that really matters
3912531 everyone from the hometown was pumped up to see that
3912532 two guys from oxnard starting together then the injuries kind of hit
3912533 were always trying to keep each other focused when one of us gets down
3912534 to see my friend go down like that it hurt
3912535 it even hurt my family so i can only imagine the pain for him and his loved ones
3912536 just getting him out here is good well elevate expectations as were going
3912537 fant stico es el trabajo que hemos realizado en regatas el profesor augusto m laga es un gran conocedor el aspecto basquetbol va en un 25 por ciento y poco a poco se va a incrementar f sicamente llegaremos en un estado optimo para el arranque de la temporada y mentalmente el equipo ha crecido bastante en cuanto al basquetbol estamos en un 75 u 80 por ciento del objetivo lo cual me hace sentir una gran ilusi n que no es lo mismo que estar satisfecho
3912538 guess to the best of your ability what you got

3912541 hago mi llamado muy respetuoso a una instituci n a la que quiero y admiro que es la polic a nacional para que sus comandantes en todas las ciudades se ratifiquen como guardianes del bien p blico y en respetuosos agentes de los derechos humanos esa es una voz que se tiene que dar frente a todas las instancias de polic a que intervienen en estos procesos

3912543 i think the events of the last few days show that there are many places in the world where we dont necessarily anticipate this kind of conflict breaking out
3912544 it does require a steady hand on the tiller and an experienced one
3912545 weve got a real clear choice to make and i say it respectfully to sen obama because hes a gifted young man but hes not ready to be president
3912546 this isnt a time for partisanship and sniping between campaigns
3912547 whatever we think at the moment we can all reserve that for a future time
3912548 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3912549 the centuries old ambitions of the russians to establish the russian empire
3912550 i dont think it means were going to reignite the cold war
3912551 but i do believe that we need to stand as courageously as we can on behalf of this little country
3912552 do what we can to reassure other nations in the region that we will try to assist them in maintaining their independence
3912553 i want to have dialogue with the russians i want them to get out of georgian territory as quickly as possible and i am interested in good relations between the united states and russia
3912554 ive been talking to senator mccain several times a day
3912555 mccain has been fighting for freedom in georgia for many many years
3912556 you never know what is going to happen when a game gets underway but clearly we didnt play well
3912557 the performance was poor but the result was good we didnt concede away from home which is always important and to play the second leg at anfield could make a massive difference
3912558 the positive thing was the result and we didnt have to say too much about the display in the dressing room because everybody already knew it wasnt good
3912559 they were very aggressive and we could not keep the ball
3912560 our passes were bad and we always lost the first and second ball
3912561 in the first 20 minutes they were on top of us and after that we controlled it a bit more
3912562 in the second half they started the same way and played more long balls and continued to win the first and second balls and if you dont win them you will continue to be under pressure
3912563 i was a little bit surprised because we were playing well in pre season with a lot of confidence
3912564 i told the players before after watching their super cup game against anderlecht that it could be like this we knew they could be very aggressive they were organised and pressed well and it was difficult for us to keep the ball
3912565 after the events of the past six days no one should wonder why countries on russias periphery so ardently seek the security guarantees alliance membership represents
3912566 the situation is still unstable and russia must back up its commitment to stop its violence and violation of georgias sovereignty with actions not just words
3912567 the united states should now join our european partners in direct high level diplomacy with both georgia and russia to seek immediate implementation of a cease fire and to achieve a lasting resolution to this crisis
3912568 for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict
3912569 i know the people of georgia have enjoyed an unprecedented period of prosperity and freedom and i know that at this time theyre suffering mightily
3912570 so maybe later on in the campaign lets have a back and forth about who has comments or statements now lets devote all our energy to helping resolve a situation which is fraught with human tragedy
3912571 theres a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience that doesnt compare between the two on russia policy
3912572 you cant compare a 15 year historical record to three or four statements over the course of 15 months
3912573 we cannot act on the basis of ideology or preconceived notions when this crisis began barack obama the administration and all of our nato allies took a measured and reasoned approach because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them
3912574 some voters may worry does he want to start a new cold war the risk for mccain is that he could overplay the issue and frighten war weary voters whose priorities right now lie closer to home
3912575 i tried to do the right things over and over and over
3912576 as it happens i think gamay is the most disgusting repulsive wine in existence i loathe gamay
3912577 we all know about your sexuality all too fucking much about it in fact
3912578 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3912579 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3912580 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3912581 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3912582 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3912583 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3912584 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3912585 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3912586 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3912587 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3912588 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3912589 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3912590 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3912591 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3912592 the dried residue from corn after the removal of the larger part of the starch and germ

3912594 it is such a surreal feeling to look behind the bus and see semi trucks with my name on them
3912595 even as this thing grows our fans are the same young kids that have always come out to the club shows they come to forget about school or work or whatever and have a good time so thats what we are going to give them
3912596 but they just stop where they happen to lie in different configurations throughout the crystal with no correlation between them and no single one lowers the energy enough to take over and reduce the entropy to zero

3912604 we are working through the process of a strategic review of hummer
3912605 we are getting some significant interest in our asset sales including hummer but probably it wont be completed immediately
3912606 acquiring mo strengthens our nucleus of players for both the short and long term he is entering his prime nba years and will be part of the foundation of our future success
3912607 his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us
3912608 i think there was so much pressure on lebron to create so much of the offense in cleveland
3912609 i think somebody like mo is going to really make the game easier for lebron and create opportunities for other people
3912610 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back
3912611 our challenge from day one has been to shape our roster in a way that our fans will see a team that is competitive that plays hard every night and has a chance to win
3912612 we feel this trade continues to move us toward that goal for this season and beyond
3912613 to some extent the olympics are beginning to influence how people use new technology
3912614 i dont think youre going to see too much of this in the future
3912615 do not mate different kinds of animals do not plant your field with two different kinds of seed do not wear clothing of woven of two different kinds of material if a man sleeps with a woman who is a slave girl promised to another man but who has not been ransomed or given her freedom there must be due punishment yet they are not to be put to death because she had not been freed the man however must be bring a ram to the entrance of the tent of meeting for a guilt offering to the lord with the ram of the guilt offering the priest is too make atonement for him before the lord for the sin he has committed and his sin will be forgiven
3912616 do not take your wifes sister as a rival wife and have sexual relations with her while your wife is living
3912617 neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of god
3912618 because of this god gave them over to shameful lusts even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones in the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another men committed indecent acts with other men and received in themselves the due penalty for they perversion

3912620 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3912621 we just want to cause some confusion in the pass rush pickups for the offensive line
3912622 we can bring any number of guys from a number of different places
3912623 having so much talent in the linebacking corps it allows us to do things like that
3912624 were able to move guys around and have one guy cover one guy blitz and then switch it around we can do so much
3912625 theres a lot of comfort camaraderie trust in one another and we understand what each other is thinking
3912626 through that you can play hard and not really think
3912627 we brought all four linebackers out there moving around and you could see the quarterback get a little confused pointing at this guy that guy if we continue to grow with that scheme well bring more and more of it
3912628 if they ran the right play or something like that theres some risk but what we try to do in situations where they run is react before they can make a first down
3912629 our guys are athletic enough to get off blocks and them not knowing where were going to be or what were trying to get done they could be thrown for a loss too it could work both ways
3912630 i welcome that opportunity and i would like to say well see more of it
3912631 i just think i bring versatility and now we have four good solid experienced linebackers to have room to work so well see what they come up with
3912632 we have gasoline subsidised at 60 bolivars jet fuel for fumigation scarcely costs 10 of the fixed price in the international market also fertilizer is obtained at half the price
3912633 we hope that we maintain the dialogue with the government and we achieve efficient supply until now 35 of consumption was supplied through the network of food markets mercal
3912634 its a situation with many variables on the one hand we have the challenge of the using products for biofuel we also have the speculation chains and the monopolies of agriculture internationally
3912635 that were sold above price and were being sold almost in secret outside of the regulations
3912636 the way the district maintains control is it sets the criteria it monitors it and says these are the things we expect to take place these are the things we want to take place and these are the things that have to take place
3912637 the idea was to raise money to improve the ballpark the first barbecue we served 800 dinners the price was 1 25
3912638 we take care of the park on a volunteer basis for the township the main goal of the barbecue is just to get people together get them out and see what the park has to offer
3912639 we hope to offer activities that are informative but also fun with a corn maize kids games and face painting
3912640 its a pretty big milestone to keep people volunteering for 50 years
3912641 this will be a beautiful fit between the state group and the local group for sustained funding
3912642 things look real good but there hasnt been final approval yet

3912646 the consumer is still under enormous pressure as employment is declining real wages are down housing and stock market wealth are down and credit conditions continue to tighten
3912647 this data is consistent with our bearish forecast of personal consumption throughout the second half of 2008
3912648 going forward a tight credit environment a deteriorating labor sector and elevated prices will act as a significant constraint on consumption
3912649 there is potential inflation outside of oil and the credit markets get a little nervous when they believe that food and energy price inflation might spread

3912683 it could have been a blown motor i had no idea what it was
3912684 we told him a number of times to get a rental car well take care of that
3912685 i got an itemized list of what i was put out for
3912686 weve done everything possible to take care of this gentleman but when youve got somebody not willing to rationalize with you and demanding ten times what is owed to him thats just taking advantage of the situation
3912687 were going to step out of it if hes demanding all these charges that arent legit youve tied our hands
3912688 yes what else would they be in gods eyes they are family we all are
3912689 of course they are a family what does a piece of paper have to do with feelings and bonds
3912690 yes marriage should not be taken lighty and if your not ready to marry dont
3912691 marriage is man made family is one of the most beautifully natural things in this world and should not even be compared to the throws of man
3912692 yes it is cause of the common bond that a family shares married or not
3912693 if they live 2gether as a couple with children 2gether then yes thats a family
3912694 a family is a group of people willing 2 put love time effort 2 c the ones they love be happy and successful u dont have 2 b married 2 give that
3912695 yes because anyone with kids married or not they still are a family
3912696 yes i think if your couple and not married and you have kids you should be able to live whatever you want to live
3912697 i think that a family is a family no matter what whether your married or not your still a family
3912698 i do not consider an unmarried couple to be a family
3912699 only small minded people would impose such ridiculous restricitons who would want to live in such a town
3912700 a family is someone who will take care of kids the correct way and each other you have people out there that may not be the bilogical parent but they may be better parents then the father or mother that is missing in action because of their choice the point is there is nobody that can say what a family is because there are people that would take care of some kids that arent even their bilogically as long as there is love true it shouldnt matter
3912701 if a man really loves a woman he will make a lifetime commitment to her before living together with her the children are an insignificant item to be pulled around from relationship to relationship and house to house they split blend chop and confuse families and noone thinks it is a big deal im glad my parents kept me in mind when deciding whether to keep their marriage commitment to one another
3912702 whose standard will we use for the definition of a family i choose gods standard which says that they would not be considered a family
3912703 no an umnmarried couple is not a family a couple who avoids marriage does so for a reason a family is committed to each other too many people want it both ways youre either married or shacking up and sleeping together does not earn the privlege of being called a family get married and get over yourselves and yes a piece of paper does matter if two people are devoted to each other then why refuse to commit no commitment means someone wants a way out thats called a hobby not a family
3912704 if someone buys a house why is anyone even trying to pretend they have a right to say who lives there it seems to be another case of a govt organization sticking its nose where it doesnt belong
3912705 the only way to stop towns from making these discriminatory rules is to amend missouris human rights law or amend the federal fair housing act so it prohibits marital status discrimination in every state the alternatives to marriage project is a national nonprofit dedicating to fairness for all individuals partners parents and families atmp has been calling for these amendments since 2006 join us
3912706 i dont agree with their family situation for sure but i dont know if the government should tell someone where they can live if they are not married
3912707 a family is between 1 man and 1 woman and the same token there are consequences when you committ sins couple should not live together without being married in my opinion that in itself should be against the law that way this country would have more morals
3912708 i think this community needs to look up the word family in the dictionary these parents are taking care of these children in the same home and providing for them and loving them in my mind that is a family
3912709 family people together who love eachother and children should not matter if they are related or married this family should not have to fight for there freedom to where they want live because they are not married
3912710 just goes to show how ignorant some people are in this state i never in my life have ever heard of such a thing this day in age a family can be a grandparent caring for there grandchildren or an aunt or uncle doing the same leave it to white america to be so ignorant and blind
3912711 oh yes there was marriage back in jesuss time matter fact there werent people
3912712 i think this is crazy my boyfriend and i have been together 6yrs now and though he is the father of our 2 girls doesnt mean we are not family just because we dont have a piece of paper to prove it no one can say you are not family
3912713 yes i think that unmarried couples are to considered a family as myself we have 4 kids and we live together we are a family a piece of paper doesnt bother us we are not ready to get married so we are choosing not too but we are still a family
3912714 that is the dumbest thing i have ever heard i am glad they are fighting it
3912715 i feel it is none of there business they were willing to sell them the house just because you names arent the same doesnt meen you arent a family and what gives the town the right to say who is family and who isnt

3912721 the siding was the first to go then they took the fence then they broke in and took everything else
3912722 it about doesnt make sense to put the family out
3912723 once people are gone youre gonna lose the house in this neighborhood
3912724 three kangaroos that would have been in the 220 pound 100 kilogram size range
3912725 there was a marsupial leopard which was probably 100 to 220 pounds 50 to 100 kilograms in weight
3912726 there was also what i would call a marsupial ground sloth that weighed several hundred kilograms at least and perhaps in excess of 1 000 pounds 500 kilogram
3912727 and then a thing that you might want to call a marsupial hippopotamus or a marsupial tapir which would have weighed about 1 000 pounds 500 kilograms
3912728 bass strait dried up and a land bridge formed between victoria and tasmania allowing people in
3912729 one of the key signatures if you like of the arrival of humans
3912730 in the americas 13 000 years ago the same thing happened in madagascar 2 000 years ago the same thing new zealand 1 000 years ago the same thing
3912731 giant sloths survived for about another 6 000 or 8 000 years after their extinction date on the mainland why because people hadnt gotten to those islands now we are seeing the same thing with tasmania
3912732 we have no evidence of any sort of specialized hunting technology at all its quite likely that these things didnt recognize humans as a threat so perhaps a wooden spear or a club was enough to kill them
3912733 this is a first major step towards understanding what happened in tasmania
3912734 there may very well be others but at the moment thats where it stands
3912735 its going really well im happy were gonna get this done
3912736 this is where visitors will come to find out where to go to see the historical aspects of the area
3912737 as money comes in well be able to finish the second floor and basement we need about 350 000 more in donations
3912738 in my worst moments i think that we might be way too late they have been jerked from pillar to post theyve ended up in one concentration camp after another
3912739 we are not being good stewards of our resources when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated wholly beneficial or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat
3912740 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
3912741 there was a lot of ice this year but the ice was thinner than usual
3912742 you can fall through it easily and the slightest wind will shift the ice
3912743 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
3912744 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
3912745 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
3912746 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
3912747 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
3912748 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
3912749 so its not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible

3912767 yeah well the niggers and the jews did nothing to get us to the moon and thats a fact
3912768 which raises a good question that a supremacist like edgar could answer
3912769 oh i think your full of shit when you say the holocaust never happened
3912770 the officer alleges that the mayor pushed him with significant force to make him bounce into the prosecutors investigator
3912771 we will investigate into the evening and who knows what goes from here we dont know at this point exactly what we have
3912772 one investigator a black woman testified that the black mayor tried to shame her for working with a white colleague
3912773 exposing and combating the leftist media has never been such fun
3912774 i appreciate her valiant efforts to make endless treaty negotiations over the implications of the monroe doctrine that no european power would interfere in the americas on the venezuela guyanese border during the 1870s interesting but at a certain point diplomatic machinations leave me cold
3912775 here is the irony and ultimately the path to the jews own destruction
3912776 more whites would be aware of the idea that races this includes jews will never co exist peacefully when forced together
3912777 the fathers have eaten bitter fruit the childrens teeth are set on edge
3912778 history is that nightmare from which there is no awakening
3912779 the sins of the fathers shall be visited on the children even to the third and fourth generation of those that hate me
3912780 jews also took an active part in the dutch colonial slave trade indeed the bylaws of the recife and mauricia congregations 1648 included an imposta jewish tax of five soldos for each negro slave a brazilian jew purchased from the west indies company
3912781 this was no less true on the north american mainland where during the eighteenth century jews participated in the triangular trade that brought slaves from africa to the west indies and there exchanged them for molasses which in turn was taken to new england and converted into rum for sale in africa isaac da costa of charleston in the 1750s david franks of philadelphia in the 1760s and aaron lopez of newport in the late 1760s and early 1770s dominated jewish slave trading on the american continent
3912782 nearly all the navigation was in the hands of the jews
3912783 edgar i dont need to read a book to learn how a
3912784 oh yeah you are all still a bunch of pussies especially cleveland and rein
3912785 edgar i dont need to read a book to learn how a
3912786 hasdai ibn shaprut who was foreign minister to abd al rahman sultan of cordova in his letter to king joseph of the chazars about 960 ad speaks of the tradition according to which the chazars once dwelt near the seir mountains the seir mountains are none other than the original land of esau edom thus dwelt esau in mount seir esau is edom genesis 36 8 seir was a mountain range sought of the dead sea and was also known as the land of edom genesis 36 21 the seir mountains were the home of the edomites for nearly a millennium the edomites arrived in edom or seir at the end of the 14th and beginning of the 13th century b c encyclopedia judaica vol 6 p 372 thus we have it from jewish sources that the khazars originally dwell near the seir mountains so are racially of edomite stock but how and when did edomites get to khazaria there is evidence that in the 6th century bc some of the edomites fled their homeland of seir and migrated north after the fall of jerusalem in 586 bc the edomites began to press northward ezekiel 36 5
3912787 the idumeans edomites were made jews and a turkish people khazars were mainly jews in south russia the main part of jewry never was in judea and had never come out of judea
3912788 what have you done listen your brothers blood cries out to me from the ground now you are under a curse and driven from the ground which opened its mouth to receive your brothers blood from your hand when you work the ground it will no longer yield its crops for you you will be a restless wanderer on the earth
3912789 with the destruction of the temple and the commonwealth in 70 c e all that came to an end only the judaism of the pharisees rabbinic judaism survived
3912790 how terrible for you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you lock the door to the kingdom of heaven in peoples faces but you yourselves dont go in nor do you allow in those who are trying to enter
3912791 how terrible for you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you sail the seas and cross whole countries to win one convert and when you succeed you make him twice as deserving of going to hell as you yourselves are
3912792 how terrible for you teachers of the law and pharisees
3912793 how terrible for you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you clean the outside of your cup and plate while the inside is full of what you have gotten by violence and selfishness
3912794 how terrible for you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you are like whitewashed tombs which look fine on the outside but are full of bones and decaying corpses on the inside
3912795 how many jewish farmers do you know nada zip none not until 1948 when britain gave you some land have you ever had a permanent home constantly following us wherever we lived living off your lying cheating and murdering repeatly being kicked out through time of our countries and societies always seeking a way to get back in to feed off of us we did not follow you seek you nor need you quite the opposite you my eternal enemy
3912796 the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes any more
3912797 but since when did the truth ever interest people like you
3912798 no no no dis is not vat dis means we jews mean no harm blah blah blah
3912799 joy youre beginning to sound like some nutty street preacher reminds of this video i saw on youtube check it out all full of fire and brimstone hollerin at those poor downtrodden ghetto dwellers
3912800 edgar why dont you just admit that you believe jews to be superior above the goyim
3912801 again i accuse you of hypocrisy and of using a double standard
3912802 you dont have to be a racist an anti semite a nazi or any other derogatory white term you can think of to want to gas a jew and put him in an oven
3912803 and for that alone they pretty much deserve what hitler gave them
3912804 hes not saying its wrong for you to be a supremacist he just wants you to openly admit it
3912805 the supremacy expounded in this hate site white supremacy entails denouncing all other races and creeds as basically sub human scum of the earth
3912806 come friendly bombs and fall on slough it isnt fit for humans now
3912807 if you want to know what slough was like in the 1970s go there now
3912808 it is to be palestinian and how difficult it is for a palestinian to be a writer or a poet how can he achieve literary freedom in such slavish conditions and how can he preserve the literariness of literature in such brutal times
3912809 and they asked him why do you sing and he answered i sing because i sing
3912810 and i was able to buy a much bigger place to live i wanted to be able to give a room to as many friends who live in care homes as possible care homes can be such miserable places
3912811 i think it is more urban im writing every day at the piano in my living room this is my best work ever
3912812 if the bill before parliament gets the support of enough parties to be passed into law new zealand will be at the mercy of the european carbon market which is the highest priced carbon in the world and where the price is increasingly set by the price of oil and gas
3912813 australia is considering reducing the risk by having one way trading and capping the price of carbon
3912814 the european union scheme only covers around 40 of emissions so a large part of the eu economy does not face the price of carbon and generous allocation of allowances to industry has shielded them from most of the impact of the charges through to 2013
3912815 carbon analysts predict if the us sets up a national cap and trade scheme they will not want to see a wealth transfer outside of the us so they will have a domestic scheme which allows low cost off sets tree planting etc from voluntary markets to keep their carbon price at a reasonable level
3912816 the government promoted this bill on the basis of a carbon price of 15 tonne the un credits that new zealand companies will most likely have to buy are currently trading at around nz 40 tonne and the analysts predict the gap between these units and the eu units currently nz 46 tonne with forecast values as high as nz 100 tonne will continue to narrow as the un trading registry gets established in the next few months meaning we will be paying dearly for our emissions
3912817 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3912818 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3912819 they are staying there to neutralize the large arsenal of weapons and other military hardware in the areas of gori and senaki these arsenals remain unguarded apparently those who guarded them fled
3912820 aimed at ensuring the peace enforcement operation in respect to the georgian side which violates all of its obligations
3912821 russian tanks continue to ravage georgia town and villages killing people destroying buildings looting theyve been doing worse things to what ive heard in the past and i could never imagine happening in my country
3912822 we as the russian federation are sticking to the agreement which has been made in moscow yesterday and we hope that the other side will show its readiness to do the same
3912823 blaming again us for doing something which is contrary to the real situation
3912824 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know they had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
3912825 there is no cease fire russian forces are moving around
3912826 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
3912827 as to whether the recent violent attacks have any links with terrorist forces there is evidence to indicate that east turkestan forces may be behind these events
3912828 are not the kind of coordinated terror attacks that are being orchestrated by some kind of organization inside or outside of china
3912829 the han and the ethnic minorities including the uighurs are equal members of the big family in china and they are all chinese citizens who enjoy the rights and freedoms allowed them by law
3912830 our organization rose to the challenge and delivered strong second quarter earnings and cash flow despite the poor economic environment
3912831 while we are never fully satisfied when sales are down we continued to outperform most of our major competitors in same store sales and to gain market share with a combination of differentiated merchandise current fashions and great value
3912832 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante
3912833 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3912834 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
3912835 this is like something you would see in new york or pennsylvania or california but not here
3912836 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3912837 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3912838 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3912839 etre mort a fait ch parlez en thomas c flood en sortant dune nuit damour incroyable il d couvre que sa copine jody la femme de ses r ves est un vampire et surprise il en est un aussi pour plusieurs couples a aurait t fatal mais tommy et jody sont en amour et tentent de r soudre leurs probl mes en plus il y a la servante gentiment appel e un minion en anglais aucune id e de comment traduire a mais on saisit lid e g n rale de thomas abby 16 ans goth de son tat parce que quelquun doit bien faire les courses pendant le jour pas r soudre leurs probl mes de couple ne sont touefois pas le principal souci de tommy et jody pour le moment en effet les copains de tommy fervents adeptes de turkey bowling traduction libre bowling la dinde ont d cid de lattraper la demande dune prostitu e teinte en bleu appel e blue and that really sucks
3912840 its involved in some of my passwords on the computer so if i changed numbers id have to change all that no good
3912841 the alternative of that is taking the mound when games dont count and youre not in anything and thats not fun at all so i love the pressure
3912842 i wasnt a big red sox fan in the offseason
3912843 i was up 3 1 and had a chance to win the world series so i had to work through some forgiveness issues there and it took about five minutes because i couldnt wait to get over here put on this jersey and have a chance to make the playoffs
3912844 i hear hes a boots guy so i might have to get him a couple pairs of boots maybe a watch
3912845 it was really nice i didnt know if the number was important to him or not but its been my number for a while so it was nice of him to give it up
3912846 the radio telethon has really become a signature event here in boston
3912847 the jimmy fund is an official charity of the boston red sox so its a natural fit that were doing something at fenway park it builds momentum for the event
3912848 having the players involved management involved and everyone else really gets behind this event as a whole
3912849 and whether the celebrities are from boston or not they really take the charity to heart
3912850 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3912851 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3912852 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3912853 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3912854 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3912855 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
3912856 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
3912857 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3912858 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3912859 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3912860 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3912861 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3912862 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
3912863 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else
3912864 our hspa network has the potential to hit theoretical peak speeds more than five times faster than at amp ts current 3g speed ranges
3912865 traditionally we have not been the first to roll out new technologies and would be more of a smart follower carefully deploying the new technology to ensure that we always offer the very best network experience
3912866 frankly i think thats disgusting honestly theyre seven and nine years old so young
3912867 i find it sad that they ruined an otherwise pretty awesome ceremony with those fakes
3912868 so forget beijing 2008 best opening ceremony so far is still sydney 2000 they didnt see it necessary to use computer generated images to impress the world
3912869 apparently the little girl whose voice was used yang peiyi wasnt cute enough it was deemed bad for chinas image to show a little girl with crooked teeth
3912870 something about passing over a child for crooked teeth just seems well wrong
3912871 china wants the olympics as a stage to present a picture perfect image to the outside world and perfection was clearly the goal for the dazzling opening ceremonies
3912872 eager to put on a perfect olympics beijing has swept its streets of fake designer handbags pirated dvds and phoney corporate logos that dedication to authenticity apparently does not extend to olympics ceremonies
3912873 the song was pre recorded the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
3912874 i have one planned from nw indiana to morrow ga when my 09 challenger r t arrives in 3 weeks were headed to speedfactory for some major mods taking us from 375 hp to 540 plus hp the drive home should be faster than the trip going there
3912875 embark on three adventures around the u s to see the sights or in this case let the challenger be seen
3912876 keeping on top of routine maintenance in your home lawn auto and boating investments especially before freezing weather hits is paramount to retaining their value and preventing costly repairs that could be avoided with a little preventative maintenance
3912877 ever since the biographies of writers came to be seen as an aid to appreciating their writings their places of birth education and residence have been scanned for presages and echoes because admirers bring custom institutions and municipalities eagerly advertise associations on occasion indeed they have exaggerated the links
3912878 although the impact on their web sites is clear i believe this may end up being just some kids who got overexcited with georgia being ill prepared to say the least
3912879 while georgia is obviously under a ddos attacks and it is political in nature it doesnt so far seem different than any other online aftermath by fans political tensions are always followed by online attacks by sympathizers
3912880 compared to the may 2007 estonian attacks these are more intense but have lasted so far for less time this could be due to a number of factors including more sizable botnets with more bandwidth better bandwidth at the victims changes in our observations or other factors
3912881 to see a ghost bike placed there in memory of my son its very comforting very touching
3912882 evidently he felt it was an eyesore that he should not have to endure in front of his property
3912883 what we got was very incomplete and it was kind of disappointing we were both able to name people who have died in the city limits whose police reports didnt show up as a result of that request
3912884 erik is trying to monitor year to year the number of people who are dying on bikes and what happens to the person who is found guilty of killing a bicyclist he also wants to make this available for potentially putting up more ghost bikes
3912885 we feel that its important that these people dont die in vain and that justice is served
3912886 just because theyre on a bike doesnt mean they should be treated any differently
3912887 we dont exactly have any plans but it wouldnt surprise me if we did so i know we want to keep putting up ghost bikes
3912888 los funcionarios son ubicados en la rama judicial dependiendo las idoneidades
3912889 as far as swinging a club thats not going to happen until next year
3912890 i just dont have a choice we simply dont know what type of swelling there would be or if there would be any residual effects the next day once you start wheeling and dealing on the knee everyones body reacts differently i could putt right now but im not going to do it
3912891 at this point theres nothing standing in our way of continuing to do what we said were going to do
3912892 all those things result in lots of other mechanical parts and bits and pieces that have nothing to do with electrical energy
3912893 such that the vehicle is not just a battery on wheels
3912894 itll have a similar set of visual cues and some of the features that were on the concept car

3912897 im here because i love china i mean i love the chinese people and so what we want to do is this symbolically we are all in it together we want to strike hard and rebuild you have got a million and a half people that are homeless they have got several thousands that lost their loves

3912912 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
3912913 this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with microsofts hyper v vmware ran face first into the very hurdle it was trying to clear
3912914 this will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise

3912944 a middle aged white man in a white shirt entered our building at 525 west capitol avenue with a gun
3912945 the operator recognized immediately there was a threat we have a process in place where she called the building manager immediately to respond
3912946 he left with a gun stuck in behind his back belt
3912947 i thought maybe someone had gotten hit by a car
3912948 she said she was waiting on the gentleman he wanted to see the chairman she tried to give him democratic party stuff
3912949 evidently he walked on around her and went in the office and started shooting
3912950 the details and stories will be told for days to come through the local and national media but the greater story involves the emotional and spiritual needs of those directly affected by these events
3912951 their lives will be marked by painful memories and unresolved questions
3912952 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
3912953 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
3912954 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
3912955 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him

3912957 and whats really fun about eddie is that hes dirty
3912958 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
3912959 we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3912960 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed people can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
3912961 that part of the wind that we all long for sometime
3912962 that girl was me just like a ghost through the fog

3912967 ha llegado el momento de que el presidente ruso haga honor a su palabra
3912968 si rusia est violando el alto el fuego y tengo informes que no son muy alentadores al respecto entonces esto servir para profundizar el aislamiento internacional en el que rusia se est moviendo

3912971 esto podr a haber sido resuelto dentro de unos l mites
3912972 pero lo que ha hecho rusia va m s all de todo eso y al prolongar el conflicto las reas inocentes en georgia est n en peligro
3912973 que rusia puede usar su impresionante poder militar en la regi n contra un peque o pa s vecino es obvio que rusia puede hacer eso sin consecuencias o que lo lleven hasta tal punto de destruir al estado georgiano eso creo que es algo diferente rusia no puede tener xito en eso

3912981 not surprisingly such a perspective is also often linked to an extremist end time obsession that acts as fertile ground for the planting watering and harvesting of all kinds of conspiracy theories related to such things as the anti christ the great apostasy and the so called coming one world government this is all very disturbing but god is in control
3912982 a large segment of the movement has been skeptical from day one theyre going to see this as a natural progression others who have been following todd are going to be spiritually shipwrecked weve most definitely seen through this revival a lot of people are not grounded in scripture so for them it wont be an issue

3912986 first off before i point any fingers i personally do want to apologize for the incident that happened at the ozone awards i hope you all dont get the wrong impression of me or my city
3912987 if i knew this was going to happen at a big event such as the ozone awards first i would not have brought my mother and second i would have done everything in my power to prevent it
3912988 i have to take the time out to apologize to the kids and to anyone who follows and supports my career for what happened at the ozone awards this past monday night
3912989 i told myself that i was gonna do my best for the new era of the streets not to go through the experiences that i go through in life for a split second i almost entertained the little girl tactics of a person who is really irrelevant nowadays
3912990 i am aware of how big this event was for the city of houston and the entire hip hop community please know that i had no intention of tarnishing this great opportunity nor the experiences of those who participated in it
3912991 i apologize once again for everything that happened but i cannot apologize for having to defend myself from someone bringing unexpected or un called violence to me and my family at any time

3913002 i found the powerblock to be very easy to bring along on my trip because of its small size it was easy to use and charged several different size i pods for myself and other family members

3913018 all the completely irrelevant personal information people post i have no patience for reading about what someone is barbecuing
3913019 i think it has great potential if people use it to track inputs around specific topics say educators in a twitter group who share tidbits from ed tech books they are reading talk about great purchase deals or even do simple tech q amp a
3913020 when i first heard about it i shook my head and thought who would ever use that it seemed like such a silly thing

3913120 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama

3913129 i am overwhelmed by the support i have received from people after tuesday
3913130 it has been very touching for me to see the responses to my blog on facebook on myspace and on my website
3913131 i got to four olympics by being hard on myself it is the only way i know but i also know that there was nothing that i could have done differently
3913132 i have tasted the sweet taste of success at the highest level and have also experienced real disappointment i took every opportunity i had and made the most of it
3913133 i will dream big again and reach those dreams i will keep going to the pool swim a bit and support the rest of the swimmers overall it has been going very well
3913134 the 100 freestyle semifinal on wednesday morning was ridiculously fast the 14th time would have won the world championships just last year swimming has completely changed over the past nine months
3913135 i have been talking a bit to some of the older competitors from other countries and they all agree that as far as facilities go beijing is the best games by far london will have a hard time living up to it but i think that it is the spectators that make the games not the stadiums
3913136 its hard to put into words how i feel at this time after his last place for the past three years i gave everything i sacrificed a lot to get to this point and to perform at the best of my abilities but that was not good enough today and i didnt advance to the semifinals
3913137 as much as that is a disappointment i know that i gave it everything i had and with that i can be proud i also saw my family today they have been supporting me for the past 24 years with my swimming and have always been there for me without question
3913138 i am very thankful that they can be here and be a part of what has been such a big part of my life
3913139 i am not sure what happened but now is not really the time to reflect on it i have many questions but i am going to enjoy the rest of the games and soak up its spirit

3913190 the state and capital in order to continue existing manufacture modern day helots who can easily be compared to the spartan ones a system which at the alter of profit sacrifices human lives inconsiderably and with audacity as ive already mentioned one of the main partners in this crime are banks which are nothing less than legitimate loan sharks and are partly to blame for the plundering thats taking place at the expense of peoples work taking all the above into consideration we can understand maki in brechts when he asks what is a bank robbery compared to the establishment of a bank but also taking me into consideration who wanting to resist on a personal level as on a mass level all that know me personally know that i have participated as much as i could to my future yoke to determine myself the conditions and quality of my life to put in to practice my refusal to work and also to play the role of yet another productive unit of yet another wheel in the wagon wanting to attack the monstrosity that is called a bank however at the same time having no illusions that ill inflict any major blows to this economic institution choosing to mark a course of dignity in my life i decided to rob a bank an act which i consider amongst many others as revolutionary and which claims deservingly its own place as such in all honesty i must admit that the money i was going to acquire through the robbery was going to have me as the end recipient at the same time however as an anarchist and as a person who wishes to show their solidarity through deeds id be one of the first to actively and with joy help in contributing to monetary needs which might come up in this scene which i belong finally what id like to point out here is that all which i have mentioned up to now does not in any way mean that i support a notion that whoever is an anarchist should be a bank robber or that whoever works is enslaved

3913244 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
3913245 this is like something you would see in new york or pennsylvania or california but not here
3913246 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3913247 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3913248 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3913249 the bulk of those arrears are arising on 8pc of our book it is a small percentage of our total book that is incurring the arrears it is contained and it is manageable
3913250 were not immune to the market downturn and our business model anticipated losses arising from some of our lending the slowdown in the wider economy means that we believe those losses may come about more quickly than expected but were taking the necessary action to contain them
3913251 we never loaned above 100pc loan to value and very little above 95pc at a time when competitors were lending 100pc
3913252 the bulk of our book is performing very strongly even in the current circumstances we have changed our criteria in some of the riskier areas limiting loan to value types of lending and quantity of lending

3913258 what started as a us financial crisis is morphing into a global economic crisis investors now expect a downturn of such intensity that it will prevent inflation from taking hold
3913259 we have seen an extraordinary sea change but this is very controversial investors may be reading too much into the fall in oil prices
3913260 it has become apparent that other economies are deteriorating fast and the whole decoupling thesis has started to come apart at the seams canada is frozen over we have arctic conditions in sweden a landslide in germany and the uk is falling off the white cliffs of dover
3913261 foreign exchange is a relative concept it is not that the us is in good shape just that others are slowing sharply central banks have been too worried about inflation when they should have been thinking about growth
3913262 long oil short banks has been the dominant trade of the credit crunch
3913263 it was almost the only game in town so to see such a dramatic reversal raises a lot of questions is there something deep seated in this slowdown
3913264 you can only stretch a piece of elastic so far before it snaps back we think this pessimism on the oil sector is overdone
3913265 watch out for the profits squeeze in the third quarter investors have turned a blind eye to the second round effects of inflation such as rising inflation it will take several months of slowing global growth to be sure that the inflationary dragon has been slain
3913266 us equities are back to 2001 levels of popularity sentiment has moved a long way not so cool britannia remains unloved
3913267 markets believe that much of the fall in sterling reflects a possibly temporary increase in the sterling risk premium
3913268 it is true to say that in the area of liquidity we probably have moved to a better situation
3913269 you can see from the measures that central banks have taken around the world that liquidity issues have certainly improved
3913270 attention is now turning away from liquidity and more towards questions of funding and viability of an institutions business plan

3913284 unsuccessful attempts by the directors to find a buyer for the business

3913288 while builders shares have soared off their lows recently data from the royal institution of chartered surveyors and home builders federation shows the mounting crisis especially affecting companies liquidity which we believe will become starkly evident in next weeks results round
3913289 we believe that it could be the grimmest for decades and investors should abandon the sector in advance
3913290 we do not believe a change in banking covenants being sought by most housebuilders will provide more than a breathing space
3913291 given the potential cashflow crisis the pressure will be on to sell at any price under cashflow covenants which we believe strongly favour debt holders over equity holders
3913292 exposed to losses arising from significant catastrophic events particularly in the us and it has a moderate level of gearing to movements in capital markets
3913293 given the stalling disposal programme we now believe it is appropriate to bring friends into line with our cautious opinion on the other uk domestic life companies
3913294 is exposed to the cyclical slowdown and increasing competitive industry pressures
3913295 reflected in a dramatic relative fall in mans share price
3913296 we believe it is too early to cut estimates but clearly confidence in our numbers has been eroded by the short term negative returns both in ahl and the hedge fund industry generally
3913297 until such time as they consider it prudent to pay them
3913298 given the delay in achieving forecasted sales exacerbated by the continued overall negative economic sentiment found in the uk administrative expenditure since the end of march has continued to be handled tightly as a result of the delay in sales the balance of cash used to finance ongoing general administrative expenditure has not been supplemented from cash generated from trading activities as anticipated
3913299 the capital expenditure involved in the development to date has resulted in a significant working capital shortfall

3913394 nobodys complaining about the fbi collecting domestic intelligence when its appropriate and authorized under the law

3913502 the regulations required us to know how to repair the fuse mechanism of the bomb in case of a malfunction the pilot would be in the cockpit and the bomb would be out there under the wing maybe they thought wed climb out on the wing and fix the thing at 500 miles an hour

3913518 the global economy and managing the cycle are foremost in underwriters minds as we start 2008 and we are currently seeing a number of them pulling back on their underwriting in the face of current market conditions
3913519 encouragingly at a time when lloyds is focussing on market reform the vast majority of underwriters remain completely committed to this process priorities for the industry in 2008 must be to continue to closely manage the cycle and push through reform in the market
3913520 2007 was another profitable year for lloyds with the market reporting a 3 8 billion us 7 7 billion profit and continuing to outperform its major international peers
3913521 lloyds benefited from a limited exposure to catastrophes but this has resulted in increased pressure on rates across all lines of business the need to exercise underwriting discipline and maintain a focus on underwriting for profit rather than market share remains essential
3913522 lloyds is in good shape to meet the challenges that face us but we cannot expect the strong underwriting conditions and low levels of catastrophes to continue last years softening market conditions reinforced once again the need for a clear strategy to enable the market to maintain discipline and strength in the face of increasing competition as a marketplace we have a responsibility to our policyholders and to ourselves to ensure that we maintain our financial strength and security throughout the course of a cycle
3913523 it has never been more important to honour our armed services both those who are currently serving in armed conflicts and those who have lost their lives in past wars through this event and the benevolence of the lloyds patriotic fund we will be able to do both

3913525 an increase in litigation and the fear of potential liability issues is impacting customers through a rise in the cost of products and services and also stifling risk taking amongst boards who are missing out on new opportunities
3913526 at lloyds we know that taking risks is part and parcel of doing business but our research shows that there are clear benefits to thinking differently about the liabilities they face and developing the right culture and structure to manage them more effectively

3913882 found that 49 percent of voters believe most reporters will try to help obama with their coverage up from 44 percent a month ago
3913883 believe most reporters will try to help john mccain win
3913884 just one voter in four 24 believes that most reporters will try to offer unbiased coverage

3913899 we have kicked off a comprehensive in depth review of our qa and release processes and will quickly make the needed changes
3913900 i updated one of my five hosts and everything appears to be fine so far

3913903 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
3913904 this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with microsofts hyper v vmware ran face first into the very hurdle it was trying to clear
3913905 this will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise

3913924 in a classic business strategy of divide and conquer telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3913925 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour
3913926 aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
3913927 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3913928 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or workchoices and our employees would get to vote on it controversial
3913929 well shoot anyone who gets in our way including americans
3913930 we continue to be very pleased with the reaction from customers we see in the market
3913931 while customers are saying they never like to pay more money they see the additional value
3913932 supposedly were going to get more value i havent seen it because i havent been shown it
3913933 we need to look at a longer term of what that level of maintenance is and ask quite honestly are we getting business value
3913934 cannot support the compulsory replacement of standard support with enterprise support at this point in time
3913935 our impression is and the feedback we got from our members is that the opposition is very significant
3913936 the feedback especially from the small to medium businesses is that they have very simple landscapes and are familiar with their systems they dont see at the moment why they should need enterprise support
3913937 of what works and what needs correction thus leverage our considerable member base to influence sap to either change the costs or change the offerings as appropriate
3913938 we want to continue to help influence this but it is not our position to demand a set dollar amount from sap
3913939 we cant go in there and say were going to demand that prices are only going to be at 17 per cent because then were acting as a collective bargaining organization and we dont have the legal right to do that
3913940 share that data among members to establish a baseline and increase transparency of ownership costs as legally permitted segment by industry size region version number you can then figure out the money spent to date and the value realized to date
3913941 i have one question wheres all the talent going to come from and if you could find the talent would they want to be sitting on the support desk
3913942 nobody jumps up and down and says i called sap and got a great answer
3913943 when you get onto sap support desk and tell them that ive always thought they really rallied
3913944 but the people in maintenance mode what are they going to use what are they going to need
3913945 i can tell you we are talking absolutely with the top 10 and 20 in saps maintenance base in terms of dollars
3913946 the question we havent yet answered is will we be in a position to take care of everybody or take a small group of customers initially and then go gangbusters in january 2010

3913952 there was some interest in converting syngas into ethanol during the first oil crisis back in the 70s
3913953 the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the byproducts they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
3913954 if we can increase this activated co adsorption on the surface of the catalyst it improves the opportunity for the formation of ethanol molecules
3913955 and if we can increase the amount of surface area for the catalyst we can increase the amount of ethanol produced
3913956 gasification to ethanol has received increasing attention as an attractive approach to reaching the federal renewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons of biofuel
3913957 the great thing about using syngas to produce ethanol is that it expands the kinds of materials that can be converted into fuels
3913958 you can use the waste product from the distilling process or any number of other sources of biomass such as switchgrass or wood pulp basically any carbon based material can be converted into syngas and once we have syngas we can turn that into ethanol
3913959 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time

3914042 and i have noticed a couple of folk believe i am wrong to go to poor countries without money and hence placing a burden on them its a very valid point and one i obviously thought a lot about before embarking on this my take on it is this the so called poorer nations the word poor always being used to describe financial status and not a level of happiness are being told by the institutions of the west that they must go down the same route as us and that financial gain equals happiness this then gets backed up by a media structure controlled by a few very powerful people with very definite agendas what i want to relay to these people is that somebody in the west who has had a fair bit of the wealth that they desire has chosen to give it all up and walk across the world to tell them that financial wealth does not equal happiness and if the trends in the rates of suicide depression and addictions are anything to go by it probably has the opposite effect but not only that if you have ever travelled asia you will know that to even offer most people in that continent money for hospitality received is a huge insult as for them paying it forward is still a way of life its only us brainwashed westerners who think that everyone thinks like we do about giving and money

3914104 its hard to imagine that at this point we are at wednesday and hes still not able to move around at full speed id like to see him start and finish a practice before we declare him ready to play
3914105 very good i think as evident today our no 2 offense was horrific in spots against the no 1 defense im disappointed today in that but all in all ive seen a lot of positive things but we have a lot of work to do we have some tough decisions to make some of the decisions will be made by the players thats why we practice the way we do
3914106 i dont know i dont have a list im pleased with a number of things i was pleased to meet tiger woods last night that was very exciting im pleased with the effort of the football team the coaches and the players are working together and im really pleased with that
3914107 im president of his fan club he spoke to the team and got a chance to visit with a lot of the players if you ask me and this is just my opinion he is global he is the no 1 superstar in all of sports at least on my list he hits all the shots all the time hes got complete mental control hes unbelievable and hopefully some of that rubs off on us lets just hope it does because hes high class character a great role model for just about every phase of life i cant say enough about him i better stop at this point
3914108 i cant comment for everybody he had a couple great messages he doesnt say a lot at least he didnt last night but he was cordial he was polite he was outgoing with the players and i think everybody gained something i know i did ill treasure that for the rest of my life
3914109 i think hes doing well again nobody is going to outwork the guy nobody what an inspiring guy it was awesome
3914110 i think its been good the trainers have all the statistics of injuries the numbers are way down we havent had guys miss practice when weve called practice weve had guys on the field i think from a heat standpoint its really paid dividends we havent sacrificed reps if anything weve gained reps although theyre not full speed ones indoors i think its been a huge upgrade to our training camp here and im very thankful obviously to the owners for going to that expense to provide that to us its hopefully going to be a winning edge for us
3914111 well its a good start the punt return and kickoff returns are the first play of offense we like to start outside our own 20 or 25 yard line i think we were one of the top teams in football in starting inside our 20 obviously our third down defense our punt return opportunities have to get better we still have a ways to go on our kickoff return we didnt function there as well as id hoped although it was the first preseason game thats got to be an area where we create field position we do have some dynamic returners and guys with pride and hopefully it continues to get better and better special teams coordinator rich bisaccia is one of the best in football in my opinion
3914112 ive come out a couple times and actually played defense and chased him down and made him work to explode and cut hes really getting close i cant tell you how excited we are about how far hes come in such a short period of time i have to keep it in perspective but were going to be very smart here and im not going to do anything until the trainers give the green light right now were still on yellow and were still working hard theres a little bit of caution but boy hes looking good and were excited and happy for him
3914113 i dont know im not a doctor im just telling you where we are right now hes made tremendous strides and i would think with carnell anything is possible
3914114 it is remarkable he got hurt in the last preseason game and hes had some long dark hours during the rehab lonely times but hes in a position now to reap the benefits of all this hard work and we need to see him do that come sunday night
3914115 i think after 19 days here lets put it in perspective thats a long time i think we all are weve had a great experience here once again i just cant say enough about the hospitality and the facilities here at disney were thankful for it but there comes a time when youre ready to go home and see your family and see your bed its nice to get in your own bed at night

3914334 there is a deep and useful wisdom in this book it is clean courageous and generous reading most good least harm gave me a much greater understanding of how i can live a better life a more conscious life and a more joyful life

3914338 at this point the garrison commander is focused on getting ready for the start of school

3914344 the slingbox goes on whoever s cable connection you want to get on good graces with
3914345 in my case my mom has a cable box in her downstairs area that she rarely uses
3914346 you download the sling media player software on pretty much any computer that you have admin rights and then you give it the unique serial number for your slingbox
3914347 once that happens you actually get a little replica of the comcast cable box so it s just like navigating through comcast
3914348 i know a bunch of expats here who have one and they like it
3914349 most of them own their own homes in the u s so they just piggyback off their own cable connections
3914350 right now we re all just kind of crowding around my laptop at the kitchen table
3914351 for 250 bucks it s nice to have the option
3914352 but the other thing you re depending on is whatever the programming is on the other end
3914353 i asked my mom hey i wouldn t mind getting hbo or some extra channels
3914354 now if we owned our own house i suppose that would nice we could watch whatever we were subscribing to
3914355 as long as you have an internet connection we can provide live stateside tv programming wherever you are
3914356 and you can watch it at home or take it with you if you re tdy to germany use your laptop to keep in touch with news and sports and your favorite shows from home
3914357 this is a gray area that the cable industry is starting to take a hard look at
3914358 slingbox has been accepted because it is just allowing the customer to access his cable programming from another location but here you have an internet provider charging fees for the service they ve become the provider
3914359 we ve looked into all this and we re confident there are no legal problems
3914360 tv programs that are broadcast outside japan are not subject to control under the domestic broadcasting law
3914361 a lot of people are coming in and looking at the demo and they re excited about the quality but what s putting people off is the price we re trying to get the price down
3914362 the cost seems high but look at what you get
3914363 there are more than 30 premium movie channels including hbo and showtime and a wide range of high definition channels so it s not much different than getting a satellite tv for the basic price and then tacking on extra yen for premium movie and sports channels
3914364 on most computers tweaking the settings on the software can improve the picture quality
3914365 they shouldn t have too many problems unless the computer they are using is really old
3914366 that d be great for an okinawan married to a marine who is assigned to a base in the states
3914367 his wife could keep up on her favorite japanese shows

3914433 while not being recession proof football is to a certain extent recession resistant
3914434 football is a special thing it gets people through the working week and fans will give up a lot of things before they let go of their season tickets
3914435 theres a waiting list but when i tried to get on it i was told the list is closed because theyve just got too many applicants
3914436 english football fans are among the most loyal sets of consumers in the world our clubs know this and in their greed theyll exploit it but they arent thinking about the long term future good of the game its a mistake to just look at the numbers of season tickets being sold and think everythings healthy for instance i think that while people may not give up season tickets they will economise by not going to cup games
3914437 season ticket holders today are very different from those of 15 or even 10 years ago their age and affluence is going up the average age of a premier league season ticket holder is now 44 and a recent survey showed that only around 9 can be classified as working class that figure used to be around 75 80 and the average age was much younger season ticket prices have gone up by an average of 7 2 this summer but its a completely short term strategy a whole generation is being priced out of premier league football a lot of young people are growing up without ever having experienced live games

3914476 we have done something important but we must still be concentrated
3914477 the discussion document is the first step in a process of consultation on possible improvements to two important areas in the imputation rules of the income tax act
3914478 imputation credits are credits attached to dividends for income tax that has been paid by the company in which shares are held new zealand shareholders who pay tax in new zealand can use imputation credits to offset their income tax
3914479 the focus of the discussion document is on those imputation credits that cannot be fully used under current law either because the recipient is a foreign shareholder or because the recipient is a new zealand organisation that is exempt from income tax
3914480 our tax law does not permit streaming of imputation credits which means directing credits away from those who cannot use them to those who can
3914481 for the same reason there is no question of allowing refunds of imputation credits to foreign shareholders in new zealand companies doing so would effectively allow them to pay no tax on their new zealand income
3914482 there are strong grounds for preventing streaming and possibly even for strengthening our anti streaming rules
3914483 similarly the government is prepared to consider the case for refunding imputation credits to organisations that have a specific exemption from new zealand income tax such as registered charities
3914484 the discussion document seeks comment on whether the lack of refunds for imputation credits affects the type of investments that tax exempt organisations make whether refunds could be made to work in some circumstances and what might be better alternatives to refunds
3914485 a very important influence on the outcome of this review is the possibility of our entering negotiations with australia to establish a system of mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits for trans tasman investment
3914486 even if mutual recognition were not to proceed any moves to allow limited streaming in new zealand would have to be discussed with australia under our existing trans tasman imputation arrangements
3914487 the questions raised in the discussion document will be of particular interest to shareholders charitable organisations tax professionals fund managers and others who are interested in developing new zealands capital markets we urge them all to express their views on these important matters

3914496 in a classic business strategy of divide and conquer telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer mr lawrence told fairfax

3914515 the track was still a little wet from rain the night before so we got some practice on running in wet conditions it dried up nicely though and we were able to get in a lot of laps we were fast when we unloaded and only got better as the day went on i feel like ive got a good chance to win
3914516 the tracks been repaved and they did a great job on it
3914517 its smooth and has a lot of grip it can still be a pretty tight fit in some of the corners so you have to pick your passing points carefully
3914518 we actually struggled a little bit at the beginning but jesus times kept getting better as the day went on
3914519 he gave us a lot of good feedback on how the car was handling and that allowed us to make the proper adjustments we were running some really good lap times at the end of the day so i think well be good when we come back for the race
3914520 trevor was doing a great job especially considering that he had never been there before
3914521 his lap times improved about a second and a half from where we started the day we still got in 29 laps before the accident so getting that seat time was important
3914522 as far as his mishap was concerned trevor missed a shift going into turn 1 and ran off the course normally it wouldnt have been that big of a deal but the ground was muddy from all the rain and it just sucked the car in

3914542 its a huge situation for me after 35 years because ive wanted to bring one back
3914543 this whole thing unfolded about two weeks ago when these two boys came on a talk show here in the states and announced theyd found a bigfoot body
3914544 the commentator asked them if they could send someone to see the body and they said the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body is the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
3914545 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there
3914546 i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being
3914547 we trekked in for a day a half what kind of lunatic would be out here in a monkey suit i saw the thing i touched it
3914548 theyre fine guys one works for the police department in georgia and the other was a correctional officer theyre pretty credible guys
3914549 well release the dna analysis and well have the body right next to the two boys then you can see its real that its not all bullshit
3914550 as long as his part time business doesnt affect his work ethic
3914551 his claims of finding bigfoot is entirely a different matter unfortunately thats spilling over into his police life and thats where we have concerns when he comes back from medical leave well have to sit down and address those issues

3914558 necessary for both the development and maintenance of the bodys blood supply
3914559 we have shown that the adult blood forming system depends on the continuous actions of mll
3914560 we and other groups can start designing targeted therapies that inhibit cancerous forms of mll that occur in childhood leukemia and do not affect normal mll function which based on our studies in mice would be fatal for the patient
3914561 theyre sleeping and suddenly they wake up and thats very dangerous
3914562 you shut off 12 percent of cells and 50 percent of the mice survive much longer
3914563 at least in mouse systems it works so it has to be tested in humans eventually

3914599 people who are losing their homes in scotland are being treated badly by the scottish government in england the maximum is reviewed every year and now stands at 47 000
3914600 im very happy with the support ive received so far its been particularly pleasing to gather nominations from across all parts of the country and across all sections of the party
3914601 however its obviously a very tight race and in the end it will be votes and not nominations that win this election
3914602 i will continue to work very hard for every vote from now until the last possible moment of the campaign outlining my vision of how labour gets back to talking about the issues that matter to the scottish people
3914603 i can offer a new voice and a fresh start for scottish labour and im delighted with the response i have received to that message from elected politicians trade unions and other affiliates and party members across the country
3914604 john macdougall gave more than 30 years of distinguished public service to fife as a councillor leader of fife council convener of fife council and then mp for central fife he will be remembered as a true servant of the people
3914605 a very popular diligent local mp he served fife with great distinction in all the roles he played
3914606 in fife he pioneered free travel for the elderly led scotland and britain with nursery education for three and four year olds was successful in pressing for new jobs and investment to replace thousands of jobs lost in mining and at rosyth naval base and was well known for his support for all local causes
3914607 over three decades he has been a good personal friend of mine
3914608 our heartfelt condolences go to his widow cathy to his son and daughter scott and julie and to his mother and sister
3914609 i was very sad to hear of the death of john macdougall and my thoughts are with his wife and children at this difficult time
3914610 john was an excellent mp and will be sadly missed by colleagues of all parties
3914611 he was a doughty fighter for the people of fife over many years as a trade unionist long standing councillor and dedicated member of parliament
3914612 i am saddened that john has lost his long and brave fight against illness and our condolences go to his wife and family at this very difficult time
3914613 we may have been on opposite sides in the commons but john carried the respect of people right across the chamber and was passionate for the issues he believed in and the welfare of his constituents which he cared about deeply
3914614 i have greatly admired the way in which he has borne such a debilitating illness with enormous courage
3914615 my thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time
3914616 i dont think this is a good decision for the functioning of the justice system
3914617 not one of my adversaries wants justice they want a political condemnation in a political case against a political adversary
3914618 russia has stated that it has halted military operations and has agreed to a provisional ceasefire

3914645 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
3914646 i think the united states must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course
3914647 the vice president al gore and i have a disagreement about the use of troops he believes in nation building i would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders
3914648 what we want to do is nip this in the bud by exempting the military personnel who are traveling under orders from having to pay a fee on their third bag
3914649 if you have a family at home and you stand at that airline counter and you have three bags in your hand and they say you cant get on board unless you pay 100 up front right now what are you going to do
3914650 if they pay they get reimbursed so at the end they dont pay a dime
3914651 theres a lot more on their mind than to have to worry or try to remember to get a hundred dollars reimbursed to them when they get into a war zone

3914659 he sentido verg enza de observar c mo cada diputado de la concertaci n trata de obtener una peque a ventaja para su distrito vendiendo su apoyo para el proyecto esto es cohecho del gobierno
3914660 solicito la presencia del ministro de transporte si es que est en el congreso porque a lo mejor anda comprando los votos que le faltan
3914661 este gobierno ni ningun gobierno democr tico compra votos y tampoco creo que ning n diputado o diputada se deje comprar las palabras del diputado bobadilla no responden a ninguna l gica
3914662 la compra de votos normalmente es un resorte de la derecha nosotros no hacemos ese tipo de cosas
3914663 est claro que toda persona tiene un precio y el gobierno se lo encontr a ascencio
3914664 fueron acordes para lo que necesitaba el gobierno que era aprobar el presupuesto de cualquier manera
3914665 cuando se toma una decisi n frente a un proyecto se debe hacer a conciencia con convicci n y consecuencia y no estar sujeto a cambios condicionados
3914666 es muy poco elegante lograr las aprobaciones entregando fondos a ltima hora
3914667 lo que ha hecho el gobierno es comprar votos a cambio de proyectos
3914668 comprar votos a cambio de proyectos le hace mal al parlamento
3914669 lo que se aprob es seguir con m s de lo mismo
3914670 saber perfectamente que votar a favor no era la soluci n el rechazo de este proyecto puede producir una crisis social y pol tica en el pa s a la cual no nos queremos arriesgar
3914671 es que el estado se haga cargo del 50 1 por ciento
3914672 no s lo es relevante para los santiaguinos sino que tambi n es una iniciativa que beneficia de manera importante a las regiones ayudando a disminuir la brecha y diferencias que existen en santiago y las regiones
3914673 no querer ceder ni un mil metro en este proyecto s lo para sacar ventajas pol ticas
3914674 quiero expresar mi repudio al actuar de la oposici n que lo nico que quiere es provocar una derrota del gobierno sin tomar en cuenta que tambi n se afectara a las regiones sacando un ventaja mezquina y ego sta
3914675 los diputados de la udi mintieron al se alar que con estos recursos no han habido mejoras en las regiones
3914676 siendo un representante de las regiones puedo decir fehacientemente que este gobierno ha hecho esfuerzos para mejorar la infraestructuras y las v as de acceso y justamente este proyecto apunta tambi n a beneficiarnos
3914677 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mr mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect

3914696 i dont see anything up ahead but more beach and i got twenty twenty vision
3914697 it means if there was something there to see id see it
3914698 we wont get there today but if you see as well as you say youll see it before the sun hits the water
3914699 its actually a very significant step for us this early site work marp mining and rehabilitation plan approval really is the approval that gives us the go ahead to commence our actual works on the site
3914700 to date weve really only been able to do test work weve put in place the 40 man camp as the base for us to commence our site work
3914701 but this approval allows us to do some of the early preparatory works its really all of the infrastructure work to allow us to starting building the mine proper

3914706 later shed claim without any substance and lacking facts that olympic judges delayed alicia sacramone from starting her beam routine in an effort to shake her concentration
3914707 marta would have none of it for whatever faint praise she would offer the chinese there were wild accusations of delay conspiracies and cheat birthdays to put smaller more nimble girls in the competition

3914743 in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men mankind humanity
3914744 wherefore for this reason he saith in psalm 68 18 when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive he took captive of what was taking captivity of others and gave spiritual gifts unto men thou hast ascended on high thou hast led captivity captive thou hast received gifts for men mankind humanity yea for the rebellious also have you given gifts to that the lord god might dwell among them all mankind the obedient and the rebellous

3914811 any time you can send yourself up and be self deprecating i think its a good thing
3914812 when you are as big as the tom cruises and david beckhams and the brad pitts of this world you can basically get away with doing anything and sometimes its better a small cameo role than doing a big part

3914815 i dont think you can possibly point to one factor
3914816 the suits are the easy thing to point at but i think the impact of that was gone by mid year 31 world records were set leading into the games now the progress is coming because there are so many people pushing and pushing each other just look at the number of countries winning medals 15
3914817 the big thing they saw in melbourne was phelpss underwater work
3914818 hes the leader in that they call it the fifth stroke now theres freestyle breaststroke backstroke butter and underwater we have seen enormous improvement from our guys in it
3914819 the gop has nothing to lose in shuting sic the ca government down you cant demonize a party already boxed in
3914820 all the more reason for the budget issue to get settled sooner over later the gop is not going to raise taxes the sooner the dems recognize this the sooner they can begin to cut slash and burn to get the budget balanced
3914821 but the biggest losers of all at least from a political sense may be the republican legislators who have barricaded themselves behind a no tax pledge that has made it impossible to emerge from this mess with their credibility intact
3914822 they clearly do not have the stomach to make the cuts that would allow a balanced budget without new revenues
3914823 the republican governor has laid out a template for a compromise the biggest obstructionists are in his own party and they appear to be their own worst enemies
3914824 the countdown continues the republicans failure to produce a budget proposal shows contempt for the people of california we have gone 42 days with nothing but bait and switch tactics
3914825 instead republicans introduced a constitutional amendment aca 19 that completely fails to address californias immediate budget crisis
3914826 by refusing to pencil out an alternative budget proposal of their own republicans are delaying the compromises that lead to a bipartisan budget agreement this is leading california to the brink of shutting down their commitment to this approach presents californians with a simple choice shut down now or shut down later
3914827 former assembly gop leader speaks out about republican attempts to borrow local government money
3914828 last week i commended the senate republicans for offering solid solutions to our state budget problem and pointed my readers to a website featuring those ideas
3914829 so the idea is to borrow money that voters appropriately intend for use by their cities then borrow more money to pay that back and then hope that enough people gamble in the future to pay that back it is crazy talk but if my friends in the senate republican caucus honestly believe if it is a viable budget option then their web page touting their budget ideas should at least mention it
3914830 californias republican party is losing ground dramatically across the state
3914831 first there is an abject failure to reach out to the youngest voters in the state there is a near total absence of youth and energy in the partys outreach plans
3914832 last week i was at the ventura county fair and the republican party and democratic party booths were across from each other
3914833 then there is the outreach to the latino community in a state and eventually a nation where the population is increasingly latino a party characterized by such attitudes will eventually become extinct
3914834 finally there is the consequence of a crumbling disorganized state gop infrastructure and leadership the exodus of conservatives both fiscal and conservative
3914835 california is becoming younger more latino and more secular the gop has completely missed these three trends and is now reaping the consequences of a leadership structure that for 20 years has struggled to keep the status quo now is the time for the party to completely rethink all three of these dimensions and step forward to rightfully claim the legacy of lincoln and reagan but something has to change and soon or else it wont matter there wont be much of a republican party left
3914836 i will not make any commitments i will not go on vacation i will not leave the state i will not do anything until i have a budget
3914837 if you can get your insurance to cover it im game

3914845 the reason why these boys are amazing people is because even with all of the fame and fortune that theyre getting they still are aspiring to be what every person in the world should aspire to be and thats good respectful humble people
3914846 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement
3914847 china would promote regional economic co operation to advance towards mutual benefits and all win results
3914848 its obvious this country is fast becoming another chinese satellite trade with china now accounts for almost 80 of kyrgyz foreign turnover the european union and russia seem to have no unified policy on kyrgyzstan in the end the chinese will become so strong that they will directly influence government policy and that will alter the foreign political orientation of kyrgyzstan
3914849 im not saying the soviet days were great but at least we had enough to eat enough water and enough power
3914850 now im struggling to feed myself ive got this trickle of dirty water and the towns plagued by constant blackouts if china can help us by investing in this country then thats fine by me

3914855 lisa i think you and biglaw could be sooo happy together you have the same old world tastes love for the finer things in life desire for global domination and resentment of small children its so perfect
3914856 omg i cannot believe how much biglaw and i have in common we went to dinner at
3914857 man summer associate is so refreshing she is so excited about the simplest luxuries and eager to spend long hours with me she is sooo impressed by my office space sophisticated practice areas and international clients she wants me
3914858 cog is so lucky to be with me i am so much more sophisticated than she will ever be and there are a million other cogs out there dying to be with me and i am famous people know me who is she she better step it up if she wants to continue to hang with me and my peeps
3914859 after two years in a committed relationship with big firm i just feel like he doesnt listen to me anymore he is all about his needs but he never asks me what i want anymore its just become so routine bill bill bill no more fine dining no paul simon concerts no flowers would he even care if i just left what happened i miss the good old days
3914860 i dont even love him anymore but at least i know his flaws i am too old to get back out there i am comfortable with him he is stable and provides a good life for me ill just have to show him i am worth the commitment i will bill more hours
3914861 ive built a quiet confidence within myself where the most nerve racking part was this right here the press conference
3914862 and that more than anything was just because we didnt have that in the ahl
3914863 i could tell right away when he walked through my office door that there was chemistry and that we were speaking the same language
3914864 i feel that my experience in providence will help me
3914865 we didnt have the team that anybody wouldve picked to win the amount of games that we did
3914866 it didnt just take coaching xs and os it took the players buying into the system that we play and being accountable to each other thats kind of the last step in my development as a coach in refining the team chemistry part of it how to get the guys to want to play for each other
3914867 ive been able to find what works and doesnt work and been able to do it on a small stage and not have to have the growing pains hopefully at the nhl level
3914868 there are more communities in northern ontario where there is declining justice
3914869 what we wanted to do was to integrate the teaching content with the practice environment of law much the same way as medical schools teaching schools nursing schools and engineering schools
3914870 the dollars are precious and there is always a limited amount of money and we wanted to put it elsewhere
3914871 a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
3914872 absolutely ron george should be thrown out for voting for gay marriage
3914873 i really felt that as chief justice i had to have the broad shoulders because i knew there would be substantial controversy about it
3914874 most people thought his legacy would be the modernization of the courts
3914875 i think the gay marriage decision will now be his principal legacy
3914876 it isnt anything that i have given any thought to i will do what i should do when that time comes about
3914877 turn around and look behind you at all the survivors
3914878 our negotiators and the americans have almost brought it the accord to a close it is not a closed deal but it is very close
3914879 i think we can defend it yes i would say that it is the most advanced version of a sofa ever that the united states has done with any other country because of the areas of compromises of concessions of understanding
3914880 this is not a recolonisation as some of our critics say or another anglo iraqi treaty of the 1930s that will bind iraq
3914881 have managed to make some compromises on all the sticky issues or problematic areas of any sofa which are universal jurisdiction detention powers of authorisa tion to launch military operations issues of sovereignty
3914882 we are talking about combat troops maybe in 2010 11 there could be drawdowns
3914883 the idea is really to keep these forces outside the main cities the population centres it doesnt mean that they could not enter or come through
3914884 our negotiators and the americans have brought it the accord to a close it is not a closed deal but it is very close
3914885 now that is the kind of thing i like seeing
3914886 more than one million voters have been to the offices to ensure that their names have been registered to add new voters delete those who have passed away or to register immigrants
3914887 this reflects citizens growing interest in the registration process which guarantees their right to vote
3914888 this morning al attiya received the british ambassador in iraq and they conferred the most important developments in the political process and the latest progress within the level of the iraqi parliament regarding the enactment of laws especially the provincial election bill
3914889 sheikh al attiya expressed his optimism concerning the discussions currently underway about the election bill
3914890 al attiya hoped that the election bill would be passed after the end of the parliaments summer vacation
3914891 ready to offer support and assistance to iraq in the fields of economy rebuilding trade and security forces training
3914892 they injected an anesthetic but didnt wait long enough for it to take effect
3914893 the next week their boss came to me and said your family still doesnt want to pay ransom so we have to send them another one
3914894 i cant describe the anguish i felt imagining pedros suffering
3914895 violence will keep increasing to the extent that mexican law enforcement doesnt take away the attraction of committing a crime
3914896 the media and society as a whole has finally recognized that there is a problem
3914897 we cant tolerate any more of this level of impunity and criminal activities
3914898 its criminals who should be afraid its the bad politicians who should be afraid its the judges who set these murderers free the ones who should be afraid its the corrupt police officers who should be afraid not us
3914899 we want a specific political accord between the president and all 32 governors of mexico to commit to reducing the rates of kidnapping in mexico
3914900 the state is not dismantling organized crime groups through the confiscation of assets freezing of assets of the financial intelligence unit and is not cooperating with police and prosecutors effectively
3914901 because nothing much has been done every day there are more and more kidnappings and everybody is affected

3914905 we are stunned and profoundly saddened by this tragic loss
3914906 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan
3914907 but obviously were appalled and shocked at the killing that has taken place
3914908 heres an individual that committed her life to humanitarian work and bettering other communities and other countries and she was shot down in cold blood its unbelievable
3914909 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3914910 they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in the humanitarian community in afghanistan
3914911 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the dangers that everybody there faces not just military people but all those who are there trying to help rebuild this country
3914912 devastated to hear of the deaths of two canadian humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan
3914913 canada is recognized the world over for its compassion and generosity both humanitarian aid workers shared these values and their convictions motivated them to contribute to afghanistans reconstruction efforts and to help maintain the hope for a better future that is so needed in a country that has been torn apart by years of hostility

3914947 the current willets point plan sets a precedent for community planning by decree rather than discussion
3914948 we now have a 9 5 trillion dollar debt with all of the concern and anxiety that causes to chris shays idea that we should be privatizing social security
3914949 hes been more wrong on the economy than hes been on the war
3914950 thrift savings accounts what we have for all federal employees having people invest in their country is a better way to get a return on your investment than treasury bills that are invested in the social security fund
3914951 we are where we are today because of a series of disastrous policies starting with the so called tax cuts of 01 and 02
3914952 where tax cuts were delivered to the very wealthiest people in this country
3914953 when i look at our economy i say thank goodness for the tax cuts in dividends and capital gains the marriage penalty exemption the reduction of the individual tax rates thank goodness we did that
3914954 shays successfully fought off strong challenges from the democrats the past two elections but the district is changing in bridgeport theyve registered nearly 4 000 new voters since the first of the year and most of them are democrats

3914961 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3914962 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3914963 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3914964 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3914965 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3914966 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3914967 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3914968 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3914969 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3914970 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3914971 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3914972 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3914973 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3914974 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3914975 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3914976 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3914977 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3914978 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3914979 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3914980 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3914981 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3914982 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3914983 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3914984 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3914985 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3914986 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3914987 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3914988 george i told you i told you we needed those papers by monday
3914989 it is extraordinarily disappointing that after our board unequivocally rejected costars 8 75 proposal costar has seen fit to come back with exactly the same proposal in a hostile fashion
3914990 to judge the value of our company by the daily trading price of its relatively illiquid common stock makes no sense
3914991 we trust that our clear second rejection of costars offer will prompt costar to withdraw it
3914992 review carefully any serious proposal from any responsible third party
3914993 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3914994 thats what im all about making the kind of changes in that office that will result in efficient fair and tough prosecution
3914995 for 21 years i have worked with the victims ive worked with victims who are in situations that they never would imagine to make their lives better with justice
3914996 what we really need in this circuit is a great working relationship with law enforcement so that we can work shoulder to shoulder against crime
3914997 i think jays record stands out over a very long period of time indicating that he is the person with the judgment to be the next state attorney
3914998 this was a political firing and nothing short of that
3914999 ms corey you were fired because youre not a leader and you didnt do your job
3915000 these are 81 prosecutors who have worked with me who have supervised me and who i supervised even in the last year after mr shorstein targeted me all agree that i am the leader for that office eighty one prosecutors

3915015 and jesus came down with them and stood in the plain and the company of his disciples
3915016 and the word of god increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith
3915017 and being let go they peter and john went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them

3915020 saat kita kita dikumpulkan untuk mengikuti perlombaan pak tuber datang dan langsung mengeluarkan pisau dari balik kaos olahraganya
3915021 saat kejadian saya sedang berada di halaman depan sekolah tiba tiba dari arah lapangan terdengar suara jeritan para siswa setelah didekati ternyata pak tuber tengah menganiaya rian dengan menggunakan pisau
3915022 setahu saya korban bukan siswa yang termasuk dalam kategori anak yang bandel begitu juga dengan pak tuber dia lebih dikenal pendiam tapi beberapa hari terakhir ini terdapat perubahan sikap hanya saja saya maupun guru lainnya tidak mengetahui penyebabnya
3915023 dia pernah menjalani terapi di rs syamsudin gara gara menderita depresi
3915024 sebulan lalu saya sempat ngobrol dengan pak tuber katanya dia mau dipindahkan ke dinas pendidikan dia minta pendapat pindah atau tidak
3915025 saya benar benar tersinggung dengan perilakunya korban dia sering mengeluarkan kata kata kotor yang ditujukan kepada saya dan keluarga
3915026 saya mengaku tindakan saya ini salah tapi selama ini saya selalu diejeknya
3915027 saat ini kami mencari motif penusukannya karena saat pelaku membabi buta melakukan penusukan masih banyak anak anak yang lain tapi mengapa rian yang menjadi korban

3915050 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3915051 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3915052 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3915053 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3915054 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3915069 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3915070 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3915071 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3915079 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3915080 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3915081 furl groups has already seen healthy organic growth in the number of groups and postings within groups some of the popular categories include travel technology music politics and parenting
3915082 our goal is to offer this service within companies and organizations as well as to individuals providing an efficient way to share information in many categories from business to academics
3915083 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3915084 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3915085 we would comply with the law if we could right now we do not have resources to produce original programs in the kyrgyz language or translate uzbek programs to kyrgyz

3915100 this is a tripartite negotiating framework you cannot get an agreement where only two parties agree
3915101 the political impasse will only be broken when we have an agreement that reflects the will of the people as expressed in the march election
3915102 we are indeed convinced that it is possible to conclude these negotiations quite quickly
3915103 i have to remember that whenever i feel buried under care the real issue is pride and my self sufficiency i must deliberately and specifically cast my cares upon him and thereby humble myself god wants me to learn to depend on him to need him and in the end to give glory to him with an ever deepening appreciation for the mighty hand of god
3915104 laughter is a divine gift to the human who is humble a proud man cannot laugh because he must watch his dignity he cannot give himself over to the rocking and rolling of his belly but a poor and happy man laughs heartily because he gives no serious attention to his ego

3915130 scheunemann and others on the foreign policy staff are involved in call requests and statements on foreign policy issues
3915131 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3915132 georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so
3915133 are they really your own views or are they the views that are bought and paid for by the clients of your top aides mccain probably would be sympathetic to georgia regardless but having a guy like scheunemann as a top aide raises questions

3915318 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3915319 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3915320 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3915321 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3915322 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3915323 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3915324 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3915325 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3915326 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3915327 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3915328 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3915329 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3915330 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3915331 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3915396 i would like to announce today that the victoria police board has accepted the resignation of paul battershill effective immediately as a result of a loss of confidence in his leadership of the victoria police department
3915397 the disciplinary hearing set for aug 18 will no longer proceed due to the resignation of battershill
3915398 the police board will not be paying a severance to battershill we will contribute a sum of 15 000 towards battershills legal fees as part of the settlement agreement the victoria police board considers this matter closed
3915399 a public hearing could be held if the commissioners office believes that the issues are such that they are in the public interest
3915400 the investigation completed by the rcmp did not find that battershill had committed any criminal acts had any involvement with any criminal activity nor did it find any financial impropriety
3915401 we as a police board have acted very appropriately and we are looking after the best interests of the taxpayers
3915402 there are some things within the last nine and a half months that we are unable to disclose only due to the fact that we are bound by the settlement agreement at this time

3915429 war prosperity is like the prosperity that an earthquake or a plague brings
3915430 war is harmful not only to the conquered but to the conqueror
3915431 to defeat the aggressors is not enough to make peace durable the main thing is to discard the ideology that generates war
3915432 the root of the evil is not the construction of new more dreadful weapons it is the spirit of conquest

3915435 israel recognizes the territorial integrity of georgia and calls for a peaceful solution
3915436 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
3915437 a small group of georgian soldiers were able to wipe out an entire russian military division thanks to the israeli training
3915438 georgian minister tells israel radio thanks to israeli training were fending off russian military
3915439 the fact that georgias defense minister davit kezerashvili is a former israeli who is fluent in hebrew contributed to this cooperation
3915440 internalized israeli military technique and if the special reconnaissance forces have chalked up any successes

3915444 chancellor angela merkel of germany joined president bush on wednesday in calling for further sanctions against iran if it does not suspend its uranium enrichment program
3915445 it might startle some americans to realize that iran has one of the most pro american populations in the middle east
3915446 this statement is a lie just like georgian president mikheil saakashvilis statement on the impossibility of using military force in conflict zones
3915447 they were rounded up like cattle shut into the house and set on fire in another place we saw a tank run over an old woman who was running away with two children we saw how they slashed up an 18 month child

3915457 extremely critical of israels policies in the territories and its attitude toward the palestinian authoritys pa security services
3915458 arousing considerable discomfort its conclusions about israel are scathing and those whove seen it say it make s israel look very bad
3915459 one of the greatest human rights crimes on earth and to see europeans going along with this is embarrassing
3915460 the top opinion pollster in ramallah said that opinion on the west bank is shifting to hamas because people believe fatah sold out to israel and the us
3915461 i think the sea probably is polluted sometimes i get strange white marks on my skin but we come down to the beach each day because we have nowhere else to go
3915462 sewage pipe pours mucky water into streams of dark waste that flow towards the sea
3915463 the sea is getting dirtier and more contaminated because of chronic fuel and spare parts shortages we need 14 days of uninterrupted power in order to run a proper sewage treatment cycle for the sake of gazas public health
3915464 waterborne outbreaks are to be avoided because of their capacity to result in the simultaneous infection of a high proportion of the community
3915465 restrictions are a clear violation of the universal right to health and a clean environment under international humanitarian law israel as an occupying power is obligated to facilitate access to all essential to life amenities access to clean drinking and sea water are basic human rights
3915466 the idf will probably stop us but part of the point is to show that gaza is closed off

3915470 the blockade makes export impossible so farmers are abandoning their crops israeli incursions result in huge destruction to lands and enterprises almost every industry in gaza is facing ruin this collective punishment must end

3915472 how can gaza be a normal place how can we live a normal life here
3915473 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings and in cars its impossible to count them now theres hardly a single building left undamaged
3915474 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
3915475 4 2 of gdp more than a quarter of all georgian public income to military hardware
3915476 georgia could have used the years of saakashvilis presidency in different ways to build up the economy to develop the infrastructure to solve social issues both in south ossetia abkhazia and the whole state instead the georgian leadership with president saakashvili undertook consistent steps to increase its military budget from us 30 million to 1 billion georgia was preparing for a military action
3915477 in addition to the spy drones israel has also been supplying georgia with infantry weapons and electronics for artillery systems and has helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia according to koba liklikadze an independent military expert in tbilisi former israeli generals also serve as advisers to the georgian military
3915478 the conflict has been sparked by the race for control over the pipelines carrying oil and gas out of the caspian region the russians may just bear with the pro us georgian president mikhail saakashvilis ambition to bring his country into nato but they draw a heavy line against his plans and those of western oil companies including israeli firms to route the oil routes from azerbaijan and the gas lines from turkmenistan which transit georgia through turkey instead of hooking them up to russian pipelines jerusalem owns a strong interest in caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean
3915479 as far as natural resources are concerned russias hand is very strong it holds 6 6 percent of the worlds proven oil reserves and 26 percent of the worlds gas reserves in addition it currently accounts for 12 percent of world oil and 21 of recent world gas production in may 2007 russia was the worlds largest oil and gas producer as for national champions putin has strengthened and prepared gazprom the state controlled gas company transneft oil pipeline monopoly and rosneft the state owned oil giant that is why in 2006 gazprom retained full ownership in the giant shtokman gas field 7 and took a controlling stake in the sakhalin 2 natural gas project in june 2007 it took back bps kovytka gas field and now is behind totals kharyaga oil and gas field

3915486 were killed by their own georgian partners in the peacekeeping forces there is a russian battalion an ossetian battalion and a georgian battalion and all of a sudden the georgians georgian peacekeepers begin shooting their russian colleagues this is of course a war crime i do not rule out that the hague and strasbourg courts and institutions in other cities will be involved in investigating these crimes and this inhuman drama that has been played out
3915487 the actions of georgia have led to deaths among them are russian peacekeepers the situation reached the point that georgian peacekeepers have been shooting at russian peacekeepers now women children and old people are dying in south ossetia most of them are citizens of the russian federation as the president of the russian federation i am obligated to protect lives and the dignity of russian citizens wherever they are those responsible for the deaths of our citizens will be punished

3915497 on a day when some faces will be whitened and some faces will be blackened as for those whose faces will be blackened it will be said to them did you disbelieve after you believed so taste then the torment of that with which you disbelieved
3915498 whiteness is in reference to nur light and blackness to darkness so whomsoever was from the companions of light and truth they are branded with the color of whiteness and shining and radiance and their pages will be whitened and they will illuminate and their light will be striving from between their hands and on their right side
3915499 and whomsoever was from the companions of darkness and falsehood are branded with the color of blackness and gloominess and sadness and their pages would be blackened and darkened and they would be encompassed in darkness from every side
3915500 what is apparent from this is that it is referring to the people of the book and their denial after belief by belying the messenger of allah pbuh after they came to know him and acknowledge him before he came i e in their scriptures and on the authority of ata whitening the faces refers to the muhajiruun the ones who immigrated with the prophet from mekkah and the ansaar those who helped immigrants in medina and the blackening of the faces is in reference to the tribes of bani quraydha and nadhir jewish tribes who sided with the polytheists and broke their treaty and it is said that they are the murtadoon renegades from islam and it is said that they are ahl bida and hawa people of innovation and desires and on the authority of abi umamah they are the khawarij and when he saw them hanging on the entrance of damascus his eyes teared up and he commented dogs of the fire the worst killed under the cover of the sky the best of the killed ones under the sky are the ones they killed abu ghalib said to him is this something from your own opinion or something you heard from the messenger of allah pbuh he said no but i heard it from the messenger of allah many times and so he said what is it with you then that makes your eyes teary he said it is compassion for them they were from the people of islam and then they rejected islam and then he recited the above verse and then he said verily on your earth there are a lot of them and i seek protection with you allah from them

3915508 that cant be contemplated under any reasonable and fair set of industrial relations laws
3915509 its just so important that these laws are removed and theres new legislation where people have got decent rights decent rights to be represented by their union and decent rights to make sure their entitlements arent stripped away by unscrupulous employers
3915510 its very important that we dont have people left in this situation again where their entitlements are stripped away from them and they are at risk of being forced on the job scrap in poverty

3915513 one thing i will not stand for however is his greenhuts denigrating remarks about jim silva a colleague who served with me on the board of supervisors and now in the assembly jim silva is an able and dedicated public servant
3915514 the two men have traded shots over the silva backed concept of an international passenger and cargo airport at el toro marine corps air station
3915515 in may silva whose biggest campaign support comes from newport beach based developers took the offensive
3915516 at the conclusion of the june 8 meeting silva twitched uncomfortably in his leather cushioned chair and stole several nervous glances at a nonchalant spitzer before launching into a speech about the controversial secrecy ordinance
3915517 the military they refer to a sneaky type person as a sniper the police refer to him as a snitch and in politics they call them headline seekers but i think weasel is a term that everybody understands a scripted silva slowly read without inflection he has called spitzer a headline seeker in the past
3915518 jenova and i realized that we were being presented with an opportunity to immediately start making the kind of games that interested us these more experimental games

3915521 theyre making interactive art experiences that anyone can come to and instantly be struck by

3915543 we were interested in working out how that programme of synchronisation leads to changes in the brain which in turn leads to changes in appetite their metabolism and what hormones are secreted and switch on or off the breeding cycle
3915544 weve discovered there is a small group of cells in the pituitary gland which produce this tsh and use it in a way that wasnt perviously appreciated
3915545 what we have is the pituitary controlling the brain instead of the brain controlling the pituitary
3915546 instead of going off to the thyroid gland the thyroid stimulating hormone goes straight from the pituitary gland just under the brain back into the bottom of the brain where it is doing things that we dont yet properly understand but which lead to changes in the reproductive activity in the sheep and probably to other wider changes in the sheeps metabolism
3915547 we believe this mechanism is a survivor because it so important to timing the changes in your biology to the annual changes in the seasons
3915548 in our own ancient past it is likely we had a very strong seasonal biology modern life has removed the need for that because we have central heating and street lights and so on but evolution takes a long time to change whereas social evolution can happens very quickly
3915549 perhaps there are some humans who have retained remnants of this ancient seasonal timing mechanism a synchronisation to the natural light dark cycle which means that they go into a winter like state

3915556 in the neighbourhood of the disneyland park are the discovery bay community about 3 km southwest of the park and has a population of over 15 000 and the ping chau island about 3 5 km south of the park populated by about 8 000 as for the rest of the territory the park is only about 12 km from the central district the heart of hong kong serious concerns have been raised about the impacts of air pollutants on the residents in the two afore mentioned communities which are within a close 3 4 km radius of the park the impact is particularly serious when they are directly downwind of the park the nightly fireworks displays going on for 365 straight days a year unavoidably aggravate the pollution there to unacceptable levels under episodic conditions in the territory being such a short distance away and on the same side of the lantau mountain buffering is clearly insufficient between the park and the communities the pollution especially the fine particulates no doubt poses a health threat to the residents especially for sensitive groups including children the elderly and people with chronic respiratory problem such as asthma bronchitis or emphysema and heart diseases existing respiratory problems will be aggravated there is also concern about the possible long term health effects of the particulates however the real life impacts of the toxic emissions on the residents have not been assessed yet

3915581 there is no way well appropriate the money necessary to fund our infrastructure
3915582 we need to find a way to look beyond the gas tax
3915583 new yorkers know the frustrations of traffic congestion all too well and usdots proposal would begin helping us and all americans get where we need to go faster more reliably and with a reduced impact on the environment the proposal recognizes the need for the federal government to set a clear vision for transportation investment so that congress stops funding bridges to nowhere and roads that states dont even want the plan also proposes ways to streamline how the federal government invests its infrastructure dollars which will help ensure that taxpayers get more bang for their bucks
3915584 the structure of the current federal system simply isnt working because it lacks flexibility and has become a grab bag for earmarks meeting our infrastructure challenges at a state and federal level will mean having to set priorities in a way that isnt currently being done and we look forward to helping move the ball forward on that front
3915585 there is a strong rationale for charging users for the costs of transportation infrastructure because they reap substantial benefits that the system provides designing and implementing a financing system that charges users of transportation infrastructure for the costs that they impose on the system can encourage efficient use of existing roads rails and other transportation infrastructure it can also help in identifying needs and paying for the construction of new infrastructure in the right places at the right time the charges users pay for the costs that they impose on the system provide a measure of the value of investment in increased capacity
3915586 the absence of national investment priorities under our current surface transportation programs has been frequently raised illustrated by long lists of highway and transit programs authorized in safetea lu many of which are heavily earmarked many such categorical programs address narrow issue areas arguably with meritorious intent but with little or no overarching national interest the commission believes that surface transportation programs should be reconstructed from a clean slate to allow for radical program reforms
3915587 reliance on fuel taxes may have been an effective funding approach in the second half of the 20th century but it may not be sufficient to address the pressing needs of the first half of the 21st century and beyond
3915588 while there is much that state governments can do to improve mobility and alleviate congestion within their borders current federal surface trans portation policies and programs which provide about one third of the funding for the nations roads will not help to achieve this goal unless congress dramatically changes federal transporta tion law chief among the many needed changes is redirecting federal transportation resources to ben efit the motorists and truckers who pay the taxes that fund the system rather than continuing to ben efit privileged constituencies who pay their lobby ists handsome retainers to divert highway money to pork barrel projects and ineffective programs many of which contribute nothing to transportation safety or congestion relief
3915589 how states can improve their transportation systems and relieve traffic congestion
3915590 ideally the federal government should not be in the business of funding local transportation and dictating local transportation policies at the least congress should repeal long range transportation planning requirements in the next reauthorization of federal surface transportation funding instead metropolitan transportation organizations should focus planning on the short term 5 years and concentrate on quantifiable factors that are directly related to transportation including safety and congestion relief
3915591 each reauthorization cycle is dominated by parochial interests around funding in particular are the debates over donors and donees this approach is anathema to achieving a true national purpose and vision and turns the program into one of revenue distribution instead of one designed to meet national needs

3915620 for we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are yet without sin
3915621 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has gone the new has come
3915622 although christ is important and without sin how does his three day death pay the price for the whole world
3915623 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
3915624 and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we have seen his glory glory as of the only son from the father full of grace and truth

3915641 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3915642 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3915643 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3915644 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3915645 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3915646 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3915647 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3915648 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3915649 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3915650 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3915651 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3915652 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3915653 she will take ideas from a lot of different places put them together and find out what the work then suggests and continue to mold it and explore it from there
3915654 oh a dancer how interesting ooh i think thats my cell phone
3915655 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3915656 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3915657 later this evening i intend to watch the video in question click the reply link above the box reserved for user comments and draft a response being careful to put as little thought into it as possible while making sure to use all capital letters and incorrect punctuation
3915658 although i do not yet know exactly what my comment will entail i can say with a great degree of certainty that it will be incredibly stupid
3915659 the result will be an astonishing combination of ignorance offensiveness and sheer idiocy
3915660 it is my moral obligation to alert the internet community to the fact that this video is totally gay and furthermore that the individual who made it is a fag
3915661 after clicking the submit button i will immediately refresh the page so that i can view my own comment i will then notice that my comment has not appeared because the server has not yet processed my request become angry and confused and re post the same comment with unintentional variations on the original wording and misspellings creating two slightly different yet equally moronic comments
3915662 it is my hope that this will illustrate both my childlike level of impatience and my inability to replicate a simple string of letters and symbols 30 seconds after having composed it
3915663 once this minor diversion is complete i will finish posting my comment then sit there like the worthless human being i am and wait for other commenters to respond
3915664 because as i mentioned before i have nothing better to do with my life
3915665 we are blessed to be living in an age when we have a global communications network in which idiots assholes and total and complete wastes of fucking human life alike can come together to give instant feedback in an unfettered and unmonitored online environment

3915667 brandons comments in particular contain a degree of unoriginality and stupidity that you only see in the most muttonheaded and imbecilic internet commenters
3915668 in fact ive seen him use at least a dozen variations of the word gay suffice it to say brandon mylenek is a truly stupid stupid idiot

3915680 in looking into the hardy weinberg equilibrium this principle helps explain the frequencies of alleles and genotypes in a population that remains constant from generation to generation this of course occurs only when certain factors are kept constant this principle works hand in hand with mendelian segregation and recombinations of alleles the five factors include random mating large population no gene flow no mutations and no natural selection forces at first glance these factors seem really hard to find on earth since our planet is constantly changing in this article black wise wang and bittles study the ethnic diversity in the peoples republic of china while studying the hardy weinberg equilibrium i noticed that this equation was not so different from that of nash equilibrium in random cases ultimately this equation helps understand the significance of data the studies included the maternal allelic frequencies though throughout history there are numerous cases of invasion and an increase in genetic flow the han hui sala and the tibetans have common maternal origins as concluded by the high frequency of the d haplogroup these studies were found to be difficult to make conclusions with there are consistencies because of the large population one of the factors needed for the hardy weinberg equilibrium even though some relevancies were found within groups of people they cannot be concluded definite facts as because of the varied deviation

3915691 we are working through the process of a strategic review of hummer
3915692 we are getting some significant interest in our asset sales including hummer but probably it wont be completed immediately
3915693 our state troopers and the new equipment provided by these grants will save lives by taking drunk drivers off alabamas highways
3915694 approximately 40 percent of all traffic deaths in alabama involve alcohol the danger drunk drivers pose to every man woman and child who travel on our roads cannot be taken lightly and in alabama we dont take this threat lightly
3915695 thanks to the governor and the department of economic and community affairs we literally are placing the laboratory in the field these bat mobiles will allow state troopers to conduct roadside breath alcohol tests of suspected drunken drivers this makes our troopers more effective in apprehending impaired drivers and it saves time and money
3915696 the dressing in womens clothing is an attempt at escapism he says it is a person other than himself who wanted attention there was nothing sexual in it it was just that schoolchildren were more likely to pay attention to him
3915697 certainly recommendations were made at the time they went up the chain of command in vietnam but by the time they came out the other end theyd changed
3915698 theres been lots of stories and views about what actually occurred i guess the important point and what we should focus on today is the gallantry of these men but also d company as a whole is to be duly recognised finally
3915699 my soldiers mostly national servicemen performed over and above what was required of them that day there were guns and bombs and rockets going everywhere everybody did exactly what they were trained to do

3915702 they dont even know who the georgian president is how can you call them georgians
3915703 for the past two years i have only represented georgia so i really feel like a georgian
3915704 of course i know who the president is he signed my passport two days ago i was with the presidents wife
3915705 we still live in brazil because its not so easy to play beach volleyball in georgia

3915708 they were saying lets go they have family back home
3915709 some of our athletes wanted to go home but president saakashvili said no now we must stay to give some happiness to people back home we stay because we respect the olympic principle of participation
3915710 of course it is difficult i have slept only two maybe three hours since i heard about the war but i think the people in georgia will be happy that we won not because we beat russia but because were in the next round the russians were bad losers yes
3915711 that its very good that georgia are through and russia are going home
3915712 by their own admission martin currie have disinvested from vedanta because of uncertainty over the future of the niyamgiri project which is shaping up to be one of the most controversial industrial projects in the world
3915713 martin currie did hold a small position in vedanta through management of one of its investment trusts this has now been sold
3915714 it is fundamental that we expect companies to behave both within the law and morally
3915715 we sent a detailed list of questions to vedanta and spoke with survival to discuss their claims we received responses to our questions from vedanta and had dialogue with survival
3915716 the doubts over the issues with the bauxite project led to exiting the stock
3915717 there has been no displacement of indigenous people as survival international claim
3915718 without a shadow of a doubt campaigns such as survival international have an effect shell came under pressure in nigeria and mining firm rio tinto in particular in papua new guinea
3915719 most companies care deeply about their image and are aware of their duties to the environment and the people who are affected by their decisions

3915726 a rasta man building a police station thats never been done before only in ethiopia
3915727 im happy about the new police station not only me but the whole police the society and the government are happy
3915728 my mum is proud of me for being in africa and doing something positive
3915729 we want to break the perception that we rastas just sing reggae music and smoke herb all day we are serious development workers
3915730 now is the time for nation building we have to stop all the idle talk and get things moving
3915731 its one thing to talk about africa and fantasise about it but when you come home and see the conditions of the youth here you realise you have serious work we need to have serious training programes for them
3915732 they were here helping afghan people they were not carrying weapons
3915733 we are stunned and profoundly saddened by this tragic loss
3915734 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3915735 words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan
3915736 we are working with our canadian colleagues to ensure consular assistance that best meets the familys needs is provided
3915737 we are deeply shocked to hear of this attack on humanitarian aid workers the four people killed were committed to helping the most vulnerable afghan communities
3915738 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3915739 it is not in our culture to kill women afghans never kill women
3915740 this unforgivable incident without any doubt was carried out by the enemies of afghanistan by non afghans
3915741 i condemn this cowardly attack in the strongest terms and urge the authorities to leave no stone unturned in the search for the perpetrators
3915742 mummy has given up all pretence of being a good mummy sweetie now im only here in case theres a fire

3915752 isaf soldiers are trained to take the appropriate steps to minimise civilian casualties
3915753 however they must take action to protect themselves when threatened
3915754 tragic incidents such as this are avoidable if the public comply with the instructions of those who are endeavouring to provide a safe environment
3915755 isaf runs frequent public service announcements and advertising campaigns aimed at keeping the local population informed about the need to maintain a safe distance from isaf convoys as they travel throughout the region
3915756 this incident is being investigated and our thoughts are with those injured civilians and their families at this time
3915757 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mr mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect

3915759 the two presidents have instructed their foreign ministers to take the necessary steps
3915760 for homeowners who need to sell this is a gravely serious situation
3915761 it can also be harmful to communities where the number of unsold homes adds more houses to inventory and puts downward pressure on prices
3915762 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough said dr erin michos co investigator for the study
3915763 its easy to see why people are so enthusiastic about the potential power of vitamin d but we must recognize the limitations of any study and exercise caution when making any broad public health recommendations said mary picciano a senior nutrition scientist at the nih who co authored a report on the conference published this month in the american journal of clinical nutrition
3915764 theres still a lot we dont know about how vitamin d levels affect health especially across different age groups and ethnic populations picciano said

3915787 first we need to end racial discrimination then seating in the lifeboats will be allotted fairly
3915788 these are all important issues but they wont matter a damn if we dont survive weve got to lower the lifeboats right away
3915789 first we need to bring prayer back into the classroom this is more important than lifeboats
3915790 first we must outlaw abortion fetuses have just as much right to be in those lifeboats as anyone else
3915791 first acknowledge our right to abortion then well help with the lifeboats
3915792 first we must redistribute the wealth once thats done everyone will work equally hard at lowering the lifeboats
3915793 first we must end the use of animals in medical experiments we cant let this be subordinated to lowering the lifeboats

3915811 i know peter lennon at wayside celtic very well and we will certainly give them the respect that they deserve
3915812 im sure ucd thought they were going to beat monaghan and my players might have the same thinking about wayside but i will ensure their feet are firmly on the ground for that game
3915813 people might not believe me when i say this but i didnt view getting wayside as an easy draw for us ive seen them play a lot and they did well in the cups last year so i know that they are a tough team to beat
3915814 beating ucd was a good scalp for us irrespective of where they are in the premier division they are a well run team and are playing against other top clubs every week
3915815 that is what cup football is all about working hard and getting a bit of luck that would normally avoid us in the league campaign
3915816 the further we go in the cup the more revenue will come in and that will make my discussions with the chairman a lot easier so hopefully we can make it through to the quarter finals

3915819 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3915820 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3915821 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3915822 so many people are being hurt by these high gas prices and it just caught america by surprise they just werent ready for these adjustments that need to be made
3915823 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions

3915951 there has been a decade long shift in where the most worrisome residues and risk are coming from
3915952 now the shares are reversed imports account for at least three quarters and each year we see the share of risk from imports going up
3915953 i am reasonably certain risks have trended downward for several key washington crops including apples but also think newer data will reveal some surprises
3915954 the department by law is required to treat the person with the ultimate goal of the person being released back to the community
3915955 because of that the department would also assess the persons ability to live in the community and look to improving job skills money management skills and other skills that would enable the person to live in the community
3915956 those apologetic methods that present christianity to the atheist as an option on the buffet table of religions to be tested and verified by how much it

3915962 a set of techniques and approaches which can be used to extend the limits of achievable reality our sense of achievable reality is the limitations which we believe bind us into a narrow range of actions and successes what we believe to be possible for us at any one time in this context the purpose of magic is to simultaneously explore those boundaries and attempt to push them back to widen the sphere of possible action

3915969 when the r word is casually bandied about and when bumbling clueless caricatures designed to mimic the behavior of people with intellectual disabilities are on screen they have an unmistakable outcome they are simply mean

3915975 you know those ads where people are running around the fields you know theyre smiling you dont know what the drug is for
3915976 i love the ads buy their medicine take it and the next day you and your spouse will be skipping through the fields
3915977 a lot of these so called blockbuster drugs are no more effective and sometimes less effective in treating conditions than old standbys that have been around for a long time and dont have all the advertising of you know people running through fields of wildflowers that convince patients that they need the new drug
3915978 i never had such a wonderful human that i wanted so much to talk to before so ive had to learn
3915979 although we ran a regular practice it was live tackling similar to a scrimmage
3915980 we went through certain drills and ran play action and we got better there is no question in my mind that we got better we got better on offense defense got to the ball and we learned a lot from today
3915981 you try to cover them in practice but in the scrimmage they just appear thats when the players have to take over and be able to call out and understand what we are looking for
3915982 he was able to distribute it and i think that he was comfortable with the timing he was a little rusty when we got started off the bat but settled in
3915983 we tried to build on the defense and stop the run
3915984 we ran one versus two a lot so that the twos could run the ball at them give them different short yardage situations so that they could learn how to convert defensively
3915985 dont you worry about the distance im right there if you get lonely
3915986 how to keep yourself out of trouble with your woman
3915987 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3915988 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3915989 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3915990 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3915991 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3915992 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3915993 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3915994 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3915995 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3915996 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3915997 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3915998 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3916004 the writer dic edwards and the composer keith burstein presented a complex view of the motivations ambitions and doubts of those attracted to suicide bombing
3916005 unsurprisingly burstein took the reviewer to mean that he was glorifying terrorists and thus once the terrorism act 2006 came into force at risk of prosecution should the opera be revived
3916006 we referred to a composer as being accused of promoting terrorism we should have made clear that this was the meaning the composer keith burstein ascribed to a review of his opera the court of appeal did not accept that the review conveyed this meaning and ruled that this conclusion could be reached only by a strained interpretation
3916007 the real threat that remains almost unmentionable in western establishment circles and therefore in the media
3916008 for us in venezuela everything is new and every time we play something it is also like the last time this is how i grew up
3916009 i respect and have learned a lot from the european tradition
3916010 when young people see orchestras just sitting down and doing concerts each week they see something routine they cant understand what people enjoy about it
3916011 in venezuela going to a symphony concert is like going to a pop concert everyone feels very proud it is our symbol we have our flag our national anthem and now our orchestras the citizens feel part of it
3916012 but thats why im ringing you i cant speak to the account holder because somethings gone wrong with your line
3916013 and is there anything else i can help you with today
3916014 it will only serve to deepen the very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said it wants to be
3916015 and its very clear to me that the consequences of that which are already quite significant because of the way that russia has brutally pushed this military operation well beyond the bounds of anything that that might have related to south ossetia calls into question russias suitability for all kinds of activities that it has said that it wants to be a part of
3916016 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3916017 things have changed and so what i think russia is seeing is that to the degree this is about south ossetia about even abkhazia lets accept that it is time to end the fighting move the forces back to august 6th positions and then have a international mediation to try to resolve these conflicts within the context of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia

3916030 de kooi van faraday met zn programmatische titel is het hoogtepunt van zijn oeuvre ingeleid door een motto van kundera welk motto alleen de eerste afdeling inleidt cb vinden de met elkaar verstrengelde themas van leven liefde en dood hun vorm door de zuivere soms adembenemende beeldspraak de innige trefzekere zegging de weloverwogen compositie in 6 cycli en niet in de laatste plaats door de grote gedrevenheid

3916035 donors who died from cardiocirculatory causes offer an opportunity to reduce waiting time and waiting list mortality among children whose survival depends on a heart transplant
3916036 i dont know how you can ever have a patient that meets the criteria for irreversible loss of function and then reverse that function in someone else
3916037 if death means irreversible loss of cardiac function and that heart beats in someone elses chest its not irreversible is it
3916038 with such consent there is no harm or wrong done in retrieving vital organs before death providing that anesthesia is administered with proper safeguards no patient will die from vital organ donation who would not otherwise die as a result of the withdrawal of life support

3916060 it is undisputed that her temporary work was performed exclusively at bellevue on schedules set and approved by that hospitals staff
3916061 to bear in mind all of the case specific variables that we and other courts have identified as relevant to the reasonableness of the attorneys fees in setting a reasonable rate
3916062 the district court got it exactly right the reasonableness of the attorneys fees incurred linked directly to the ability to maintain the case as an flsa collective action
3916063 there were no prior warnings as described in the firms own employment policies
3916064 being five months pregnant todaro began looking immediately for a job as she was the primary breadwinner her first obligation was to her firstborn child
3916065 my salary cut was a clear indication that they no longer wanted me there
3916066 well those cases are crap and thats why im not working on them
3916067 when i said that the cases were crap what that meant was i determined whether or not those cases had merit the cases that didnt have merit you didnt negotiate those cases
3916068 clearly the pattern of defendant feltons conduct in the instant action is subject to costs and sanctions
3916069 ms feltons intransigent conduct demonstrated by her refusal to return the down payment with the accrued and statutory interest to plaintiff compelled plaintiff to commence the instant action and motion practice
3916070 your honor may i ask the court to compel ms felton to deliver the check she has put in her pocket
3916071 ms felton will you be willing to hand over the 30 438 81 check
3916072 in the instant action a reasonable attorney would have refunded plaintiff her down payment after the real estate contract was unable to close
3916073 further a reasonable attorney would not make material misrepresentations to the court comply with court orders that are not stayed and not subject the reasonable attorney from being found in contempt for willful failure to comply with court orders it is clear that ms feltons course of conduct in the instant action is not reasonable
3916074 this is a judge who has an ax to grind
3916075 only a small minority within the bar association supported it
3916076 this thing was trotted out in a manner that was well intentioned but flawed
3916077 are concerned that we not give out free legal services to people who can afford them
3916078 we are here to make the system work for the public
3916079 theres no need to hire staff to represent middle class people
3916080 there were no parameters for identifying who the services were going to go to
3916081 how much is that taking out of the pockets of young and struggling attorneys
3916082 maybe im na ve but i do not think this program would have caused lawyers to lose any business i see these people every day and they do not have money for lawyers
3916083 the legal community sees what a tremendous difference it has made for the uncontested dockets
3916084 all five of them were positive about it and then it was approved
3916085 little did we know that it would result in so much controversy
3916086 i thought it was a great idea for bexar county
3916087 im just stunned that a few attorneys can hold the rest of the citizenry hostage

3916121 theyre borrowing the money primarily from the chinese to pay with borrowed money and that is as he says a cost for future generations
3916122 now i dont think the economic stimulus package would make sense because it stimulated the economy but it made sense because its the first tax break for the middle class

3916133 i would like to announce today that the victoria police board has accepted the resignation of paul battershill effective immediately as a result of a loss of confidence in his leadership of the victoria police department
3916134 the disciplinary hearing set for aug 18 will no longer proceed due to the resignation of battershill
3916135 the police board will not be paying a severance to battershill we will contribute a sum of 15 000 towards battershills legal fees as part of the settlement agreement the victoria police board considers this matter closed
3916136 a public hearing could be held if the commissioners office believes that the issues are such that they are in the public interest
3916137 the investigation completed by the rcmp did not find that battershill had committed any criminal acts had any involvement with any criminal activity nor did it find any financial impropriety
3916138 we as a police board have acted very appropriately and we are looking after the best interests of the taxpayers
3916139 there are some things within the last nine and a half months that we are unable to disclose only due to the fact that we are bound by the settlement agreement at this time

3916176 when this crisis began barack obama the administration indeed and all of our nato allies took a measured and reasoned approach because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them
3916177 john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive very belligerent statement and he may or may not have complicated the situation

3916179 despite volatile trading in second half 2008 and the requirement to clear seasonal stock our gross profit percentage is up approximately 10 basis points on second half 2007

3916421 the papers direction is one which the union has been advocating for some time
3916422 now is exactly the time for itps to be clear about their role in the development and delivery of first class professional and vocational education and research
3916423 this paper takes the initiatives contained in the new zealand skills strategy action plan and maps out the role of the itps in being the first place of choice for education for a future workforce whether the students are straight out of school or already in paid employment
3916424 we want itps to become the first choice when workers look at upskilling and we want itps that can really make that distinctive contribution that the government is looking for this paper is an excellent first step
3916425 the announcements are a major endorsement for the strong recovery that has continued at witt in the last eighteen months
3916426 the return of a full council and the write down of debilitating historic debt adds further momentum to our recovery and will continue to bolster community confidence around witts ability to continue to meet the educational needs of the region
3916427 we have a fresh new leadership team that will ensure that the gains at witt and the current momentum will continue
3916428 the potential wiping of the significant accumulated debt even though it is conditional will assist management and staff to refocus on tertiary education in the region it is clear that the new ceo has grasped the nettle and is proceeding to consolidate as well as looking for opportunities for growth

3916430 one of the most significant aspects of the agreement is that it will allow new zealand researchers to be eligible for european union programmes that wouldnt otherwise be accessible said mr hodgson

3916432 it is vital for industry government and other stakeholders such as local authorities to know exactly what this business is worth institutions enz and the ministry of education need robust accurate and assessable information based on sound data collection and analysis
3916433 twenty years ago international education was a very modest industry
3916434 in the last decade foreign earnings have gone up over 400 percent markets have ebbed and flowed but the industry has emerged from an unhealthy dependence on china and developed into a robust and diverse supplier of top quality education services both at home and abroad with major scope for further expansion into a willing and receptive global market
3916435 the lack of health research funding in new zealand needs to be addressed
3916436 over the next two years this lack will translate to more of the health workforce moving overseas attracted by higher levels of funding and the facilities these can provide this will not only have a huge impact on the level of care available but will also affect the ability of the academic sector to train new doctors
3916437 new zealand has a unique position in the medical research field with a highly trained local workforce and a different disease profile to other oecd countries
3916438 to keep up this record and retain our workforce we need an immediate 20 percent increase in hrc funding followed by consistent annual increments of 30 percent
3916439 they are being taught in an often inappropriate context for higher education in numbers that are too large it sends a bad message
3916440 regularly compelled to engage in behaviours and practices that were unrelated to or which could even counter their own notions of authenticity and success
3916441 considerable stress and pressure and found their academic worth questioned and considerably diminished
3916442 i felt i may as well jump before i was pushed
3916443 felt compromised by a greedy and insatiable system which renders success fragile and tenuous
3916444 they were highly critical of the pervasive pressure on academics to bring in the money for its own sake suggesting that this represents an anti academic ethos which is symptomatic of the attempt to make universities more corporate and business like
3916445 a few participants indicated readiness to undertake new commitments in private education services and to remove a number of existing limitations which discriminate against foreign education providers
3916446 all limitations on cross border supply and commercial presence for non public higher education services

3916455 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
3916456 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
3916457 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
3916458 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

3916514 ada seorang raja pada zaman sebelum kalian ia memiliki seorang tukang sihir ketika tukang sihir itu telah tua ia berkata kepada sang raja sesungguhnya usiaku telah tua dan ajalku telah dekat karena itu utuslah kepadaku seorang anak muda agar aku ajari sihir maka diutuslah seorang pemuda yang kemudian ia ajari sihir dan jalan antara raja dengan tukang sihir itu terdapat seorang rahib pemuda itu mendatangi sang rahib dan mendengarkan pembicaraannya sang pemuda begitu kagum kepada rahib dan pembicaraannya begitu ia sampai kepada tukang sihir karena terlambat serta merta ia dipukulnya seraya ditanya apa yang menghalangimu dan bila sampai di rumahnya keluarganya memukulnya seraya bertanya apa yang menghalangimu sehingga terlambat pulang lalu ia pun mengadukan halnya kepada sang rahib rahib berkata jika tukang sihir ingin memukulmu katakanlah aku terlambat karena keluargaku dan jika keluargamu hendak memukulmu maka katakanlah aku terlambat karena belajar dengan tukang sihir suatu kali ia menyaksikan binatang besar dan menakutkan yang menghalangi jalan manusia sehingga mereka tidak bisa menyeberang maka sang pemuda berkata saat ini aku akan mengetahui apakah perintah ahli sihir lebih dicintai allah ataukah perintah rahib setelah itu ia mengambil batu seraya berkata ya allah jika perintah rahib lebih engkau cintai dan ridhai daripada perintah tukang sihir maka bunuhlah binatang ini sehingga manusia bisa menyeberang lalu ia melemparnya dan binatang itu pun terbunuh kemudian ia pergi maka ia beritahukan halnya kepada rahib lalu sang rahib berkata wahai anakku kini engkau telah menjadi lebih utama dari diriku kelak engkau akan diuji jika engkau diuji maka jangan tunjukkan diriku selanjutnya pemuda itu bisa menyembuhkan orang buta sopak dan segala jenis penyakit allah menyembuhkan mereka melalui kedua tangannya alkisah ada pejabat raja yang tiba tiba buta ia mendengar tentang pemuda itu maka ia membawa hadiah yang banyak kepadanya seraya berkata sembuhkanlah aku dan engkau boleh memiliki semua ini pemuda itu menjawab aku tidak bisa menyembuhkan seseorang yang bisa menyembuhkan adalah allah azza wa jalla jika anda beriman kepada allah dan berdoa kepadanya niscaya ia akan menyembuhkanmu ia lalu beriman dan berdoa kepada allah dan sembuh kemudian ia datang kepada raja dan duduk di sisinya seperti sedia kala sang raja bertanya wahai fulan siapa yang menyembuhkan penglihatanmu ia menjawab tuhanku raja berkata saya tidak tetapi tuhanku dan tuhanmu adalah allah tegasnya raja bertanya apakah kamu memiliki tuhan selain diriku ia menjawab ya tuhanku dan tuhanmu adalah allah demikianlah sehingga ia terus menerus disiksa sampai ia menunjukkan kepada sang pemuda pemuda itu pun didatangkan sang raja berkata wahai anakku sihirmu telah sampai pada tingkat kamu bisa menyembuhkan orang buta sopak dan berbagai penyakit lainnya sang pemuda menangkis aku tidak mampu menyembuhkan seorang pun yang menyembuhkan hanyalah allah azza wa jalla raja berkata aku tidak kata pemuda apakah kamu punya tuhan selain diriku ia menjawab tuhanku dan tuhanmu adalah allah lalu ia pun terus disiksa sehingga ia menunjukkan kepada rahib maka rahib itu pun didatangkan sang raja berkata kembalilah kepada agamamu semula ia menolak lalu di tengah tengah kepalanya diletakkan gergaji dan ia dibelah menjadi dua kepada pejabat raja yang dulunya buta juga dikatakan kembalilah kepada agamamu semula ia menolak lalu di tengah tengah kepalanya diletakkan gergaji dan ia dibelah menjadi dua kepada sang pemuda juga dikatakan kembalilah kepada agamamu semula ia menolak lalu bersama beberapa orang ia dikirim ke gu nung ini dan itu sebelumnya sang raja berpetuah ketika kalian telah sampai pada puncak gunung maka bila ia kembali kepada agamanya biarkanlah dia jika tidak maka lemparkanlah dia mereka pun berangkat ketika sampai di ketinggian gunung sang pemuda berdoa ya allah jagalah diriku dari mereka sesuai dengan kehendakmu tiba tiba gunung itu mengguncang mereka sehingga se muanya tergelincir lalu sang pemuda datang mencari sampai bisa bertemu raja kembali raja bertanya apa yang terjadi dengan kawan kawanmu ia menjawab allah menjagaku dari mereka kembali ia dikirim bersama beberapa orang dalam sebuah perahu kecil raja berkata jika kalian berada di tengah lautan maka biarkanlah ia jika kembali kepada agamanya semula jika tidak lemparkanlah dia ke laut yang luas dan dalam sang pemuda berdoa ya allah jagalah aku dari mereka sesuai dengan kehendak mu akhirnya mereka semua tenggelam dan sang pemuda datang lagi kepada raja sang raja bertanya apa yang terjadi dengan kawan kawanmu ia menjawab allah menjagaku dari mereka lalu sang pemuda berkata wahai raja kamu tidak akan bisa membunuhku sehingga engkau melakukan apa yang kuperintahkan jika engkau melakukan apa yang aku perintahkan maka engkau akan bisa membunuhku jika tidak engkau tak akan bisa membunuhku raja penasaran perintah apa sang pemuda menjawab kumpulkanlah orang orang di satu padang yang luas lalu saliblah aku di batang pohon setelah itu ambillah anak panah dari wadah panahku lalu ucapkan bismillahi rabbil ghulam dengan nama allah tuhan sang pemuda maka raja memanahnya dan anak panah itu tepat mengenai pelipisnya pemuda itu meletakkan tangannya di bagian yang kena panah lalu meninggal dunia maka orang orang berkata kami beriman kepada tuhan sang pemuda kami beriman kepada tuhan sang pemuda lalu dikatakan kepada raja tahukah anda sesuatu yang selama ini anda takut kan kini sesuatu itu telah tiba semua orang telah beriman lalu ia memerintahkan membuat parit parit di beberapa persimpangan jalan kemudian dinyalakan api di dalamnya dan raja pun bertitah siapa yang kembali kepada agama nya semula maka biarkanlah dia jika tidak maka lemparkanlah dia ke dalamnya maka orang orang pun menolaknya sehingga mereka bergantian dilemparkan ke dalamnya hingga tibalah giliran seorang wanita bersama bayi yang sedang disusuinya sepertinya ibu itu enggan untuk terjun ke dalam api tiba tiba sang bayi berkata bersabarlah wahai ibuku sesungguhnya engkau berada dalam kebenaran

3916518 iman bertambah sampai puncak langit yang tujuh dan berkurang sampai kerak bumi yang tujuh
3916519 iman itu terdiri atas ucapan dan amalan bisa bertambah dan berkurang apabila engkau mengamalkan kebajikan maka iman akan bertambah dan apabila engkau menyia nyiakannya maka iman pun akan berkurang
3916520 seorang mukmin yang diberi taufiq oleh allah taala dia senantiasa berusaha melakukan dua hal pertama memurnikan keimanan dan cabang cabangnya dengan cara mengilmui dan mengamalkannya kedua berusaha untuk menolak atau membentengi diri dari bentuk bentuk ujian cobaan yang tampak maupun tersembunyi yang dapat menafikannya menghilangkannya membatalkannya atau mengikis keimanannya itu
3916521 sesungguhnya orang orang yang beriman itu adalah mereka yang apabila disebut nama allah gemetarlah hati hati mereka dan apabila dibacakan kepada mereka ayat ayat nya maka bertambahlah iman bereka dan kepada rabb mereka itulah mereka bertawakkal
3916522 barangsiapa mentadabburi al quran dia akan mengenal rabb nya azza wa jalla dan mengetahui keagungan kekuasaan dan qudrah nya serta ibadah yang diwajibkan atasnya maka dia senantiasa melakukan setiap kewajiban dan menjauhi segala sesuatu yang tidak disukai maulanya yakni allah taala

3916525 apa saja yang pada banyaknya memabukkan maka pada sedikitnya juga adalah haram
3916526 setiap yang memabukkan itu adalah arak dan setiap yang dikategorikan arak itu adalah haram
3916527 pasti akan berlaku di kalangan manusia manusia dari umatku meneguk minum hisap sedut suntik arak kemudian mereka menamakannya dengan nama yang lain
3916528 dari abu musa berkata bersabda rasulullah saw tiga orang tidak masuk syurga penagih arak orang yang membenarkan sihir dan pemutus silaturrahmi
3916529 mereka bertanya kepada engkau tentang arak dan perjudian katakanlah bahawa pada keduanya itu dosa yang besar
3916530 hai orang orang yang beriman bahawasanya arak judi berkorban untuk berhala dan bertenung itu adalah perbuatan keji termasuk perbuatan syaitan sebab itu hendaklah kamu meninggalkannya semuga kamu beroleh kejayaan
3916531 sesungguhnya syaitan termasuk hendak menimbulkan permusuhan dan kebencian di antara kamu lantaran khamar dan judi itu dan menghalangi kamu dari mengingati allah dan sembahyang apakah kamu tidak mahu berhenti
3916532 kami berhenti wahai tuhan kami kami berhenti wahai tuhan kami
3916533 jauhkanlah diri kamu dari khamar benda yang memabukkan sesungguhnya khamar itu ibu segala kerosakan kekejian kejahatan
3916534 telah berkata ibn masoud tentang benda yang memabukkan sesungguhnya allah tidak akan menjadikan ubat bagi kamu pada benda yang ia telah haramkan kepada kamu
3916535 telah berkata waail bin hujr bahawa tareq bin suwid pernah bertanya kepada nabi s a w tenang pembuatan arak maka nabi menegahnya maka baginda bersabda penulis membuatnya untuk tujuan perubatan maka nabi bersabda sesungguhnya arak itu bukan ubat tetapi penyakit

3916556 demand from the western australia resources sector including over 70 billion in current and proposed oil and gas projects plus infrastructure works continues to drive a strong expansionary position for tutt bryant in the west
3916557 although global equity and credit markets continue to be more fragile and volatile than in recent years i remain cautiously optimistic about the prospects for asx over the medium term
3916558 the performance of asx during the difficult market conditions of fy08 underlines the resilience and diversity of the groups business model
3916559 the uncertain economic outlook will provide challenges in the current year and we expect to see pressure on volumes and tonnage in print and distribution amp fulfilment
3916560 looking ahead long term contracts and a lean cost base should underpin a consistent operating performance
3916561 pmp print will require only maintenance capital expenditure over the next few years as a consequence of the times acquisition
3916562 importantly each business within pmps portfolio is primed for organic and bolt on growth
3916563 pmps strong capital position and cash flow give us the flexibility to pursue value accretive opportunities in the market as and when they arise
3916564 pmp continues to record solid volumes in core markets while controlling costs and capital expenditure
3916565 we just reacted because we didnt have any other option any civilised country would act same way i may remind you september the 11 the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction
3916566 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people rightly
3916567 it is not in russias interests to continue to hanker for a soviet past because frankly its gone and its good that its gone
3916568 work choices is a thing of australias past not its future
3916569 we have already ended the making of australian workplace agreements because they did so much harm to australian working families
3916570 the workplace ombudsman will certainly respond if a complaint is made
3916571 the leaked documents show the company is determined to defy the rudd government on its industrial relations policy
3916572 the documents show telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3916573 so were now talking to our staff about collective agreements to make sure that they have the best terms and conditions
3916574 my hope is i will be replaced by someone young and energetic who has the potential to be not just a great representative of our community but to contribute substantially to our country
3916575 our increased profit after tax guidance is indicative of our ability to manage our business throughout the economic cycle in particular in times of slower consumer spending which we have experienced in the third quarter and particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008
3916576 all states showed a softening in sales growth in the second half with the fourth quarter being notable for its volatility
3916577 we were anticipating a slowdown and had started planning for it more than 18 months ago
3916578 as part of the planning process we ensured that each key component of our business was prepared for a soft retail environment
3916579 this means we are well placed to deliver our gross profit margins within our target range of 39 5 per cent to 40 per cent throughout fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2012
3916580 utilised the month of july to clear out any remaining surplus winter stock
3916581 we are now in the position of our year end stock in 2008 being eight per cent lower than in fiscal 2007 which means we have a very clean inventory position entering into fiscal 2009
3916582 as we had expected we experienced volatile retail conditions in the second half
3916583 we have a proven business model a strong cash position clean inventory levels an established cost efficiencies program and opportunities for growth
3916584 we believe our company has a bright future and that we are well positioned to continue our track record of delivering year on year growth in shareholder returns
3916585 despite volatile trading in second half 2008 and the requirement to clear seasonal stock our gross profit percentage is up approximately 10 basis points on second half 2007
3916586 this means we are well placed to deliver our gross profit margins within our target range of 39 5 40 0 throughout fiscal 2009 fiscal 2012
3916587 if anything we predate the green movement so you could argue that the greens are actually jumping on our bandwagon back in the early seventies for example naturism was defined as a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by self respect respect for others and for the environment even before then in the 19th century naturists always stressed their eco credentials
3916588 i for one will enjoy the balmy climate that encourages nudity
3916589 so we actively support pro global warming places and companies no longer will nudists be forced into the fetish of clothes wearing it frees up everybody to go clothing free the way god intended
3916590 the scramble to cover every eventuality clotheswise is replaced by a disdain for apparel bordering on the obsessive the immediate effect of this textile trimming is that my luggage normally equal in volume to a medium sized car consists of just a small case
3916591 the time now is for the united states of america to act united on behalf of the people of the country of georgia and not do a lot of partisan sniping
3916592 he has been really helpful in raising our morale and i really appreciate that because senator mccain has been fighting for the freedom of georgia for many many years
3916593 he understands every issue involved here he understands what we are punished for and the same for senator obama
3916594 and i know that they are at this moment of difficult diplomacy that they are doing what they can to support the efforts of the administration
3916595 when this crisis began barack obama the administration indeed and all of our nato allies took a measured and reasoned approach because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them
3916596 john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive very belligerent statement and he may or may not have complicated the situation
3916597 during an international crisis when bipartisanship is needed most its disappointing that the obama campaign has chosen to launch inflammatory and baseless political attacks

3916611 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3916612 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3916613 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3916614 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3916615 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3916616 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3916617 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3916625 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3916626 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3916627 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3916628 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3916629 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3916630 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3916631 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3916632 our experiences will be designed so when they are connected to windows 7 they seamlessly extend the windows experience and we will work to follow the windows 7 style guidelines for applications we will work with the internet explorer 8 team to make sure we deliver an experience that seamlessly extends the browser with our toolbar and other offerings search and msn

3916642 the improved inventory position should lead to fewer markdowns in the back half of the year and some modest gross margin improvements

3916645 should his assistance be needed on the potential problems with the project
3916646 i think the point here is that the plea agreement laid out robert moultries intentions and whatever they were they seem to be misdirected because the mississippi land water and timber resource board was overseeing the project

3916651 operations that have been conducted by iraqi security forces in diala are the toughest missions yet for these forces throughout the iraqi cities
3916652 terrorists perceive diala as their last battalion bastion as they fled there from other iraqi cities
3916653 security forces accomplished 50 percent of the targets of operation bashaer al kheir promise of good conducted in diala province
3916654 the commander of iraqi ground forces general ali ghidan asked us to withdraw our forces from the north of diyala province on august 10 but weve received no order from the presidency of autonomous kurdistan
3916655 we have a brigade deployed in the saadiya qara tapa and jalawla districts and we are not budging because so far weve received no orders from the kurdish regional presidency to withdraw
3916656 there are meetings between kurds and the ministry of defence to find a solution to the problem

3916665 the record suggests alnor sought to transfer to the opposing parties the cost of every minute counsel expended on the case whether or not anti slapp work was involved
3916666 faced with a motion that involved little or no time spent on discovery the trial court was justifiably puzzled at the size of the fee request the trial court observed the matter was not particularly complicated for an anti slapp motion and nothing in counsels billing submission establishes otherwise the attorneys legal research entries do not suggest the pertinent issues were difficult since counsel spent almost as much time on mundane research concerning page limit extensions and whether the trial court had discretion to delay the motion hearing beyond 30 days as on any particular substantive question indeed the five attorneys alnor deployed on the motion appear to have expended more time telephoning conferencing and e mailing each other than on identifiable legal research for the motion supporting the trial courts conclusion the matter was overstaffed in sum based on the trial courts own observations in managing the proceedings up to the hearing and on the billing record eventually submitted the court could reasonably determine counsels fee request was unreasonably padded vague and worthy of little credence
3916667 given that precedent so amply established the controlling issue the trial court was entitled to note in assessing the reasonableness of more than 400 hours counsel logged on appeal that counsel failed to uncover or cite the seminal cases applying the dispositive standard the trial court could reasonably conclude the inflated noncredible often vaguely documented hours claimed by counsel precluded turning alnors contingent fee arrangement with counsel into a windfall

3916695 actually i have a part that just came up were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
3916696 in 1990 when mrs thatcher was prime minister the human fertilization and embryology act discriminated against the disabled by allowing disabled babies for the very first time to be aborted right up to full term my question is if in power would you favour measures to reverse this discrimination by giving unborn children who are disabled the same protection under the law as currently enjoyed by all other children
3916697 a short answer first then a longer one my personal view about that is no i think abortion votes and votes on embryology and votes on all of those things should be free votes they are matters of conscience and on the last embryology bill weve just had i pushed very hard if you remember the prime minister wanted to have whipped votes like they had whipped votes in the house of lords and i said this is wrong this is a conscience issue this is one where mps have got to examine their consciences listen to their constituents and explain their positions and it should always be a free vote so it should always be a free vote my own view is yes i think that we should change the abortion limit down from 24 towards 20 weeks i voted that way and i think it would be right to do that but in the case of parents who have medical evidence that they may have a very disabled child i would not want to change that and i speak as someone i mean ive got a six year old boy who is severely disabled has cerebral palsy and is quadriplegic and hes a sweet boy hes a lovely boy ivan and you know it is though incredibly tough bringing up disabled children and i dont want to kind of put myself in the position of saying to other parents youve got to go ahead and have that child or you cant have an abortion or you can do this or you cant do that personally ivan hes brought incredible things to my life but it is an enormous challenge and i dont think its right to sort of tell other parents if you hear that youve got a very disabled child on the way that actually doing something about it isnt an option thats my view
3916698 when the movie comes out i bags the role of gabe

3916700 probably the best book ive ever walked over on the way to the kitchen
3916701 when the movie comes out i bags the role of hannah
3916702 if i owned a set of eyes and thumbs i would choose only to read this book again and again
3916703 thats why right now weve got him in a psych unit and we are having him examined to find out what his thought process is
3916704 well you dont get people who pick a name out of a telephone book and decide theyre going to kill them thats just not rational thought process
3916705 i see him all the time at least once a week we still have feelings for each other i still love him and i think he loves me
3916706 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3916707 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day
3916708 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3916709 it happened very casually he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and had sex
3916710 like a dagger going through my heart it hurt so bad
3916711 he casey thought she was just saying she was pregnant to get him back because at that point they were broken up once again he told me it wasnt true and not to worry at no point did he say kelli shes pregnant we cant do this anymore its not right we would hang out and hook up have sex i dont know where jamie lynn thought he was he probably said he was just going out with the guys but really he was coming to be with me
3916712 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop but even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3916713 those aliens will pay for this one way or another

3916716 we are trying to ensure that all children have basic health and hygiene needs taken care of
3916717 we have a particular problem with institutionalized children and children with disabilities who have also been affected by the conflict and were making sure that social services are able to provide support for the especially vulnerable children who do not have the protection of a family
3916718 aerial bombardments snipers tanks these are devastating for children and this is a number one concern that the huge escalation in violence and conflict will have a psychological impact not only on children but on their parents as well
3916719 the context of the conflict the pace of the conflict and the military hardware and capability that has been deployed have huge impacts on children
3916720 this software is simpler than audacity and has the very useful and indeed important feature of being able to split the music into tracks either automatically or with manual assistance cd wave will save the resulting tracks as wav mp3 ogg or flac files wav is for making audio cds and mp3 is for the car flac files are lossless as you say and are about half the size of wav files
3916721 before proceeding to study applications that may not make physical sense
3916722 one should differentiate between an isomer programme and what might be called the hafnium programme
3916723 the former has added significantly to the body of science as documented by many peer reviewed and published results that have achieved acceptance in the nuclear physics community
3916724 the hafnium program was focused to my knowledge on proving a specific claimed effect that has even now not been successfully observed by any independent and sceptical group it would be a shame to throw the baby out with the bath water by equating these two overlapping yet distinct programmes with quite different aims and outcomes
3916725 this approach differs dramatically from suggestions for use of isomeric materials in explosives applications
3916726 this process requires a resonance between the nuclear and atomic electron transition energies
3916727 in principle these might be adjusted within a high temperature plasma to bring an appropriate atomic transition into resonance with the nucleus
3916728 a secondary role of awe is to provide independent advice to the uk government on potential threats to the security of the uk so an understanding of the fundamentals of isomer physics is essential
3916729 if visitors have the impression that there was not a great difference between the suffering of jews and those of homosexuals its a scandal

3916732 i was doing something i dont normally do changing the theme of the blog but it turned out that it was just after the hacker had got in
3916733 he or she was creating a web page factory within my website that probably within about 24 hours created a few thousand pages every time a search engine came in it would build a new link
3916734 it was amazing i had the site fixed within 48 hours but even a week or two after that if you did a search for some of these things my website came up as number one two three
3916735 we are seeing more and more websites becoming infected we count 16 000 new malicious web pages every day its one every five seconds and 90 of them are on legitimate sites that have been hacked
3916736 a lot of that will be the bad guys setting up blogs with malicious content but some of them will also be sites that have been hacked
3916737 as bloggers have updated to the patched version of wordpress we have seen the number of hacked blogs drop accordingly
3916738 they want to keep it running so they want to avoid being a blip on the radar
3916739 however these types of tools are overkill for most blogs my personal belief is that hosting providers should offer these services
3916740 on saturday morning i do a check of my various blogs and on monday i do it again
3916741 on the internet a lot of traffic comes through google so you want to be sure you have a good record with them
3916742 it says you can only download for use on a single pc or a single network
3916743 it seems a little pointless when the welsh language board has already paid to have it done and has a mission to disseminate it as widely as possible
3916744 if we were to increase the gap by even a second or two this problem would not have arisen
3916745 enough of a success given that it provides us with the data to go operational

3916778 i think kevin glenn is ready to come back and be the starter hes probably going to be calling 95 per cent of the game
3916779 mistakes are going to be made that happens no matter whos calling the plays so were just going to go out there and whatever glenn calls were going to go run it to the best of our ability

3916830 part of the issue is that programming systems are defined by the users needs which are infinitely varied across companies

3916832 in the other disciplins you simply cant ship a product that isnt finished but we do it all the time

3916843 every day we hear from schools businesses and many others about what they are planning and how they are excited to be a part of the shakeout and to encourage others to participate
3916844 all this is coming together in a way that has never happened before
3916845 whats really rewarding as a scientist is to see how the scientific foundation provided by the shakeout scenario seems to be inspiring real preparedness actions throughout the region this is important because its what we do now before a big earthquake that will determine what our lives will be like after
3916846 heres the reality everyone in every occupation starts as an apprentice those who are good enough become journeymen the best become master craftsmen this is as true of business executives and history professors as of chefs and welders getting rid of the ba and replacing it with evidence of competence treating post secondary education as apprenticeships for everyone is one way to help us to recognize that common bond

3916854 the show supernanny has been criticized for using techinques to achieve quick results for the television audience only to leave the parents high and dry with misbehaving kids when they leave this would seem to discount their wisdom with children and suggest that their solutions are only short term
3916855 i believe that the only thing that is short term in these cases is the parents investment in the new programs that have been implemented parenting is a rough job that truely requires energy and committment a childs behavior is a reflection of the environment that the parent has ultimately created from the moment a child is born it is learning about this environment and reacting to it this is why i think that the nanny spends more time correcting the parents actions than the childs
3916856 the nanny is forced to teach the parent skills that took her 15 years in the field to learn such as parental vigilance self control and so forth i feel that if the contestants actually followed the nannys instructions exactly and with enthusiasm the children would continue to respond to the program implementation
3916857 i am a firm believer in the concept of the show and i apply the ideas with great success as i work with oppositional defiant youth on a regular basis i can attest to the long term success of their techniques supernanny deserves credit for the strides they have made in the science of parenting
3916858 ive set up an informational site to help parents and teachers to get the answers they are seeking there are many free resources on the web but if you would like more information about parenting try www psychologyempire com as a valuable resource for people seeking answers
3916859 he has not shown that the u s has either as a matter of deliberate policy or official indiffernce required or allowed its combatants to engage in widespread actions in violation of humanitarian law
3916860 no matter how much i wanted to i could not convince myself that killing someone was right
3916861 i have already missed a large chunk of my young sons life and i was willing to sacrifice any more lost time with him especially during his formative years
3916862 because it is an act of aggression with no defensive basis it has been supported by pretenses that cannot withstand even elementary scrutiny first before the u s dropped the first bomb it was quite evident that iraq had no weapons of mass destruction second the bush administration had the gall to exploit the american publics fear of terrorists by making the absurd assertion that a secular batthist government was working with a fundamentalist terrorist group there was nevery any intelligence to substantiate this third the notion that the u s wants to export democracy to iraq is laughable democracy is by the people not an appointed puppet theater
3916863 a u s soldier who deserted his iraq bound regiment and sought asylum in canada said the u s war in iraq was illegal and he accused the united states of committing war crimes pfc jeremy hinzman 25 is believed to be the first u s soldier to apply for refugee status in canada after refusing combat duty in iraq
3916864 i was told in basic training that if im given an illegal or immoral order it is my duty to disobey it
3916865 whether a country lives under freedom or tyranny or whatever else thats the collective responsibility of the people of that country
3916866 this is a very disappointing decision it puts canada more fully in complicity with an illegal and immoral war jeremy will probably end up back here at fort bragg thats usually what happens
3916867 i applied for conscientious objector status in the u s army because i realized that i cannot kill a fellow humna being but my application was denied i knew that in iraq i would be ordered to take part in combat operations or other actions that are against my principles
3916868 nga and i knew canada had welcomed many americans like us during the vietnam war and we knew canada had refused to join the invasion of iraq
3916869 sending jeremy and his family back to the u s where he would face harsh punishment would be cruel
3916870 it would fly in the face of the motion adopted by the house of commons on june 3 which called on the harper government to stop all deportation proceedings against these conscientious objectors
3916871 jeremy hinzman 29 had filed for a pre removal risk assessment and permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds with citizenship and immigration canada in january after several prior failed attempts to gain refugee status today he was told that both of those applications had been rejected and he must leave the country by sept 23
3916872 obviously were disappointed but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we end up
3916873 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed
3916874 robidoux said hinzman who lives in toronto with his wife and two children plans to take a close look at the decisions before deciding how to proceed
3916875 federal ndp citizenship and immigration critic olivia chow who put foward the june 3rd parliament motion called the decision to expell jeremy mean spirited she called on citizenship and immigration minister diane finley to hald the deporation of hinzman and other resisters immediately
3916876 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
3916877 these refugees have an uncertain status they are referred to as guests not refugees and year long residency permits are hard to obtain the vast majority were granted short stays in the country which since 2005 have become virtually impossible to renew without official paperwork the refugees are not allowed to work
3916878 are being sold for sex there is a large sex trade in young iraqi girls in the nighclubs of damascus fourteen and fifteen year olds literally girls not even women yet and even children are being sold
3916879 they have been great to me but i will no longer be involved with the pageant due to the fact that i really couldnt take it when i saw all those refugees in syria being mistreated seing these people suffer made me ashamed i dont deserve to live in a classy apartment while other women are selling themselves what kind of sick demented human being would want to have sex with a 10 year old
3916880 annual government budget in iraq exceeds 70 billion us dollars where is that money going power cuts are long people get electricity for only an hour or two a day water is cut off as well
3916881 u s lawmakers appropriated 8 5 billion to train and equip iraqs security forces in 2007 and 2008 of that sum roughly 457 million went to the iraqi air force
3916882 t he bad news is that 12 000 people represent a tiny fraction of the vast exodus of iraqis driven from their homes by the violence and ethnic cleansing unleashed by the 2003 u s invasion estimates of their number vary the widely used figure of 5 million is about one in five to get that into context relative to the size of the population it would equal the forced displacement of almost 60 million americans
3916883 at the end of july european countries decided to halt the processing of accepting new refugees and to postpone until september discussions about those who submitted their requests for refugee status the decision does not stem only from concern over the growth in the number of iraqis in europe and an increase in the muslim element on the continent but primarily against the backdrop of iraqi preime minister nuri request to stop absorbing refugees al maliki explained to european heads of state and interior ministers he met with that the situation in iraq has improved and iraq needs its refugees in order to rebuild the state
3916884 the district commissioner of al multaqa district abdul kareem ali nasif and three of his guards were wounded by a suicide car bomb that targeted the convoy of nasif while he was going to his office district in al multaqa district west of kirkuk early morning

3916889 john macdougall gave more than 30 years of distinguished public service to fife as a councillor leader of the fife council convener of fife council and then mp for central fife he will be remembered as a true servant of the people
3916890 a very popular diligent local mp he served fife with great distinction in all the roles he played over three decades he has been a good personal friend of mine and i visited him on monday
3916891 we may have been on opposite sides in the commons but john carried the respect of people right across the chamber and was passionate for the issues he believed in and the welfare of his constituents which he cared about deeply he will be much missed
3916892 johns courageous fight against illness in recent times meant that parliament was denied his shrewd interventions on so many issues
3916893 its bound to be the case that there is the possibility of a quarter or two of negative growth
3916894 the government will end up having to borrow significantly more than expected
3916895 employment growth has ebbed to a trickle indeed employment has fallen in several regions while the rise in unemployment is gaining worrying momentum
3916896 the figures are a tragedy and hide the misery for tens of thousands of households where people lose their jobs
3916897 the economy is losing momentum but with inflation set to rise to 5 per cent or more in the short term there is little room for interest rate cuts in the immediate future
3916898 we have lower output and higher costs but they are both understandable and we have still delivered financial results in excess of predictions

3916907 failing to conduct their business with due skill care and diligence and failing to organise and control their business effectively
3916908 it is imperative particularly in more challenging financial conditions that firms have in place appropriate systems and controls to manage their risks
3916909 the subsidiaries here failed to take appropriate steps to control the potentially high risk combination in the structured credit groups scg holdings of exotic products opaque valuations and high leverage
3916910 the sudden and unexpected announcement of the writedown had the potential to undermine market confidence
3916911 our overall control framework remains sound and we have taken actions to implement a remediation programme to address the findings of our internal review
3916912 the credit crunch is there and everybody has been affected by it
3916913 we dont get away just because we are a football club
3916914 i am disappointed that they have stepped away from this i know that there are practical difficulties and that there were matters of principle that the fashion industry found difficult but i feel the bfc should show leadership on this issue
3916915 i feel that to ask all models to produce a mandatory certificate of health compromises their dignity and potentially infringes their human rights
3916916 furthermore the logistical constraints involved with ensuring all models are medically checked in good time to fulfil work engagements represent an ongoing obstacle

3916931 these last couple of weeks of the preseason will determine if rogers is ready for game action and has the strength in his rehabilitated knee to produce on sundays he will be monitored closely but the only way to determine if a player is ready to play is to insert him into a ball game and watch how he responds for corners the first thing coaches will look for is the burst down the field the ability to plant and drive out of breaks and how the player does near the line of scrimmage is he tentative has he lost a step down the field can he plant off that knee and drive down hill on the football these are normal questions folks and they have to be answered before rogers plays a down when it counts

3916937 in 1969 a 14 year old beatle fanatic named jerry levitan armed with a reel to reel tape deck snuck into john lennons hotel room in toronto and convinced john to do an interview about peace 38 years later jerry has produced a film about it using the original interview recording as the soundtrack director josh raskin has woven a visual narrative which tenderly romances lennons every word in a cascading flood of multipronged animation raskin marries the terrifyingly genius pen work of james braithwaite with masterful digital illustration by alex kurina resulting in a spell binding vessel for lennons boundless wit and timeless message

3917036 spring is finally here spring when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love and eliot spitzer turns to the yellow pages also the fifth anniversary of the iraq war how romantic once again they forgot to greet us with flowers traditionally this is the wood anniversary five which is fitting cause thats what dick cheney gets when he thinks of war the war is going into its sixth year with no end in sight the economy of course is tanking but what is america freaking out about right now that apparently barack obama went to a church and heard his pastor criticize america and just sat there everybody knows when you hear something your pastor says that you dont agree with you get up there and you punch him in the f face and you beat him with the cross not only that this reverend wright apparently he officiated when obama got married wait til they find out the wedding band was the wu tang clan the thing is republicans of course dont allow dangerous religious freaks to advise their campaigns they nominate them of course obama had to answer this did you watch his speech he hit all the notes he said racism is real for black people he said white resentment is real for white people but at the end of the day why cant we all come together with the shared knowledge that asians cant drive the good news is on youtube the obama speech now is getting watched more than the clips of the pastor the bad news is that its still far behind the footage of spitzers hooker on girls gone wild this chick is everywhere i swear to god she won american idol the last person to get this famous for f some idiot was kevin federline new yorks new governor david paterson he made history this week hes black hes blind and hes hornier than the last guy he hadnt taken his hand off the bible when they swore him in before he admitted to having multiple affairs see this is what women dont get about the male sex drive he was blind and he still wanted to see other people and its not easy having an affair when youre blind he used to come home with lipstick on his shoes his wife was cheating too did you know that i would have loved to see that confrontation honey i may be blind but im not blind and now the new york post says that eliot spitzer is in therapy for sex addiction im not sure he really understands the process today he requested an analyst with really big tits

3917038 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
3917039 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
3917040 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
3917041 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
3917042 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president

3917070 putting glenns number up with the other honoured players at rexall place is absolutely deserving and its the right thing for our organization to do
3917071 glenn could bring fans out of their seats with his unbelievable goals and they always seemed to be such timely goals especially in the playoffs
3917072 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3917073 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3917074 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3917075 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3917076 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3917077 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3917078 stock repurchases we expect more in the 4bn to 5bn per quarter range as well as ongoing pc cycle strength should provide momentum to the shares through year end
3917079 this is an obvious tragedy both for todd and shonnah and the move of god in lakeland
3917080 they had problems a couple of years ago and i got involved at that time to lend support and give counsel to todd and his staff in talking with todd i was led to believe those issues were now in order obviously they werent
3917081 we know that many of you will have questions for most of which we presently have no answers
3917082 we are all of one heart in that we want to see their marriage restored and just as important see their hearts get healed from these points of weakness that have been there for years
3917083 i had hoped that the previous troubles had been resolved and worked through
3917084 doing all that we can do to bring correction and counsel to todd
3917085 a period of time while the couple both continue to receive counseling
3917086 the outpouring has put a tremendous strain on their counseling process because the process for all intents and purposes was almost suspended because of the exaggerated distance and the exaggerated seven days a week schedule
3917087 we believe that it is important to recognize and defend the authenticity of this outpouring by the testimonies of the countless thousands who viewed on god tv or attended at lakeland and were healed set free and delivered through jesus christ
3917088 i love todd i will always love him i will carry him in my heart and prayers and never let go
3917089 for the body of christ for todd for his family

3917091 now put it on me baby til i say ooh whee and tell me to shut up before the neighbors hear me
3917092 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3917093 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3917094 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3917095 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3917096 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3917097 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3917098 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3917099 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3917100 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3917101 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3917102 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3917103 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3917104 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3917105 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3917106 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3917107 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3917108 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3917109 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3917110 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3917111 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3917112 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3917113 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3917114 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3917115 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3917116 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3917117 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3917118 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3917119 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3917120 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3917121 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3917122 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3917123 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3917124 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3917125 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3917126 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3917127 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3917128 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3917129 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3917130 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3917131 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3917132 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3917133 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3917134 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3917135 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3917136 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3917137 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3917138 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3917139 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3917140 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3917141 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3917142 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3917143 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3917144 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3917145 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3917146 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3917147 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3917148 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3917149 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3917150 who are open to doing something on the production side
3917151 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3917152 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3917153 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3917154 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3917155 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3917156 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3917157 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3917158 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3917159 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3917160 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3917161 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3917162 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3917163 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3917164 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3917165 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3917166 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3917167 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3917168 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3917169 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3917170 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

3917280 they were here helping afghan people they were not carrying weapons
3917281 we are stunned and profoundly saddened by this tragic loss

3917285 we are deeply shocked to hear of this attack on humanitarian aid workers the four people killed were committed to helping the most vulnerable afghan communities
3917286 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3917287 it is not in our culture to kill women afghans never kill women
3917288 this unforgivable incident without any doubt was carried out by the enemies of afghanistan by non afghans

3917295 our ticket prices have only gone up three per cent this year which is extremely low considering how much all of our costs rise each year we do keep our prices down as low as we can
3917296 what weve definitely noticed though is that people seem to be less willing to take a risk on shows this year
3917297 the bigger names are selling much better in advance than the unheard of ones much more so than in previous years
3917298 what is perhaps happening is that people are only booking for three shows a day instead of five and are not going for the riskier shows that they would normally
3917299 people also seem to be waiting until the last minute to buy a lot of their tickets and only buying for things that they think are going to sell out
3917300 the problem with these bigger venues is that the ticket prices are just too high
3917301 a few years ago you could see an unknown act for the price of a couple of pints now youre talking about the cost of four pints
3917302 why should people pay more than 10 for something theyve never heard of before
3917303 the current set up of the fringe is completely unsustainable
3917304 i think edinburgh is less busy this year but audiences in our venues have been well up people just arent prepared to pay the prices
3917305 to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird
3917306 i am speechless it started to sink in a little after the butterfly i was trying to focus on my next race but i kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty neat title and im definitely honoured
3917307 it is not every day you get all five of these ingredients come together but even if one of them wasnt present phelps wouldnt be the swimmer he is
3917308 he is just a normal person although he may be from a different planet a planet from a different galaxy
3917309 the proposals from dundee have been impressive in particular the plans to create a bike rental scheme which will allow people to pick up a bike at a rail or bus station use it for free for half an hour and then pay a rental fee at an hourly rate
3917310 this initiative could also be used as a template for other local authorities to follow showcasing the very best examples of sustainable travel initiatives from across scotland resulting in a catalyst for change throughout the country
3917311 we need to look at ways of persuading people out of their cars and on to more sustainable forms of travel such as trains buses walking and cycling
3917312 a further blow for jobs in the uk financial services sector which is being brought about by the credit crunch and changing economic climate
3917313 we get a dozen letters a week from people querying the origin of words and suggesting which words should be included in the dictionary
3917314 the dictionary reflects changing times and in every edition we get a snapshot of the preoccupations of the current time
3917315 inherently amusing word not only onomatopoeic to the ear but by way of a visual equivalent somehow animated when spied upon the page those twin os jostling one another to mime the definition
3917316 in order for animals to breed seasonally at a higher latitude away from the equator they use the annual cycle of day length to synchronise their annual clock
3917317 we were interested in working out how that programme of synchronisation leads to changes in the brain which in turn leads to changes in appetite their metabolism and what hormones are secreted and switch on or off the breeding cycle
3917318 weve discovered there is a small group of cells in the pituitary gland which produce this tsh and use it in a way that wasnt perviously appreciated
3917319 what we have is the pituitary controlling the brain instead of the brain controlling the pituitary
3917320 instead of going off to the thyroid gland the thyroid stimulating hormone goes straight from the pituitary gland just under the brain back into the bottom of the brain where it is doing things that we dont yet properly understand but which lead to changes in the reproductive activity in the sheep and probably to other wider changes in the sheeps metabolism
3917321 we believe this mechanism is a survivor because it so important to timing the changes in your biology to the annual changes in the seasons
3917322 in our own ancient past it is likely we had a very strong seasonal biology modern life has removed the need for that because we have central heating and street lights and so on but evolution takes a long time to change whereas social evolution can happens very quickly
3917323 perhaps there are some humans who have retained remnants of this ancient seasonal timing mechanism a synchronisation to the natural light dark cycle which means that they go into a winter like state
3917324 ok we are in a credit crunch but so is everyone else
3917325 they dont even know who the georgian president is how can you call them georgians
3917326 for the past two years i have only represented georgia so i really feel like a georgian
3917327 of course i know who the president is he signed my passport two days ago i was with the presidents wife
3917328 we still live in brazil because its not so easy to play beach volleyball in georgia
3917329 we were not beaten by georgia we were beaten by brazil
3917330 i want to congratulate them we had a good match we fought our hardest i dont want this to be a war between us i appreciate and respect them as players
3917331 they were saying lets go they have family back home
3917332 some of our athletes wanted to go home but president saakashvili said no now we must stay to give some happiness to people back home we stay because we respect the olympic principle of participation
3917333 of course it is difficult i have slept only two maybe three hours since i heard about the war but i think the people in georgia will be happy that we won not because we beat russia but because were in the next round the russians were bad losers yes
3917334 that its very good that georgia are through and russia are going home
3917335 im very happy with the support ive received so far its been particularly pleasing to gather nominations from across all parts of the country and across all sections of the party
3917336 however its obviously a very tight race and in the end it will be votes and not nominations that win this election
3917337 i will continue to work very hard for every vote from now until the last possible moment of the campaign outlining my vision of how labour gets back to talking about the issues that matter to the scottish people
3917338 i can offer a new voice and a fresh start for scottish labour and im delighted with the response i have received to that message from elected politicians trade unions and other affiliates and party members across the country
3917339 you have a style of writing i just cant do
3917340 by their own admission martin currie have disinvested from vedanta because of uncertainty over the future of the niyamgiri project which is shaping up to be one of the most controversial industrial projects in the world
3917341 martin currie did hold a small position in vedanta through management of one of its investment trusts this has now been sold
3917342 it is fundamental that we expect companies to behave both within the law and morally
3917343 we sent a detailed list of questions to vedanta and spoke with survival to discuss their claims we received responses to our questions from vedanta and had dialogue with survival
3917344 the doubts over the issues with the bauxite project led to exiting the stock
3917345 there has been no displacement of indigenous people as survival international claim
3917346 without a shadow of a doubt campaigns such as survival international have an effect shell came under pressure in nigeria and mining firm rio tinto in particular in papua new guinea
3917347 most companies care deeply about their image and are aware of their duties to the environment and the people who are affected by their decisions
3917348 but what is not fully understood is that someone working in an indian sweatshop making footballs might value the work as the only source of income for their family one has to respect different cultures
3917349 all the threads that hold a community together a common identity role models a sense of safety were given by young people as motivations to join gangs our research suggests that young people are creating their own youth communities and gangs in search of the influences that could once have been found in traditional communities
3917350 young men from deprived backgrounds who have poor parental relationships can often find the support they dont find within their families among a group of similar young men there is a sense of understanding through their shared experience
3917351 when you do not experience success in school or home and lack the aspiration to do so the reputation as a fighter or gang member may be all you have
3917352 lacking a strong role model in my life and being involved in a bad relationship i started smoking cannabis and was suffering from very low self esteem
3917353 this lack of confidence and motivation i feel also prevented me from engaging with my local community and from seeking a job
3917354 someone who made me feel good about myself and built up my confidence
3917355 through this i am now working in a job i love and able to use the experience i have gained to mentor other young people
3917356 i passed by the explosives shed maybe less than a minute before the blast and i didnt notice anything wrong
3917357 i went up the steps from the work area and i had just gone into my storeroom when the whole lot went up it was a huge explosion all the buildings down below where i worked were destroyed
3917358 i learned later that cpl hendry had come out from the tunnel and he spotted something on fire and shouted out a warning had he not raised the alarm quite a few more men would have been killed
3917359 instead of looking after himself he ran towards the blacksmiths shop grabbed a pail of water and headed back towards the magazine where he made a desperate attempt to put out the fire
3917360 cpl hendrys bravery and his subsequent awarding of the gc was not generally known locally until fairly recently
3917361 i think its wonderful that the courage of this unsung hero is now being officially recognised in the place where he lost his life
3917362 this could be the most futile recovery plan for gordon if he loses the election there is a high chance that he will step down voluntarily
3917363 he is going to make a big speech at the labour conference in september to fight for his political life if he then goes on to lose glenrothes he is stuffed
3917364 if we lose this gordon will be the only labour mp in fife which is just untenable he has a massive test ahead of him and he cannot afford to fail
3917365 this would be a good time for jack to jack it in
3917366 the likely scenario is we go back to parliament in october then call it we go to the polls in november and have possibly two by elections
3917367 rather than rush into a decision about going to university students should invest time in re evaluating the many paths to success including vocational courses and apprenticeships
3917368 practical learning is a genuine alternative to an academic university degree which can lead to a successful high achieving career
3917369 the process also serves to widen the view young people have of the types of courses and institutions available for study in scotland
3917370 young people should take care when looking at their options during the clearing process to ensure they choose a course and a place of learning which best suits their circumstances
3917371 parents are being helpful rather than anything else knowing youngsters and their ability to cope sometimes parents will just be better at remembering to ask all the relevant questions
3917372 we are african its eight years now going on nine since i returned home
3917373 i went to school in england in the seventies we were taught all about the slave ships but i thought there had to be more to this history than they taught in school
3917374 coming home to shashemene you see good people stay silent we need good people to agitate for africa in africa people are suffering more than all
3917375 i speak for the oppressed ive been oppressed all my life ive been beaten across my loins i want to be what i am an african
3917376 why are you sending a man to prison and blighting his prospects for a herb you need to legalise it god created it
3917377 a rasta man building a police station thats never been done before only in ethiopia
3917378 im happy about the new police station not only me but the whole police the society and the government are happy
3917379 my mum is proud of me for being in africa and doing something positive
3917380 we want to break the perception that we rastas just sing reggae music and smoke herb all day we are serious development workers
3917381 now is the time for nation building we have to stop all the idle talk and get things moving
3917382 its one thing to talk about africa and fantasise about it but when you come home and see the conditions of the youth here you realise you have serious work we need to have serious training programes for them
3917383 i get a real buzz when people see them for the first time and get excited and fired up about them
3917384 examination of the aircraft revealed that the water rudder attachment post at the rear of the left float had been distorted and a weld on the rudder pivot tube had failed allowing the separation of the rudder
3917385 the damage was consistent with the water rudder having struck a submerged object
3917386 the aircraft had operated for 85 hours since its last scheduled water rudder inspection required at 100 hour intervals
3917387 to prevent corrosion a liberal coating of grease is applied to the rudder mechanism during the inspection and this is likely to have obscured the presence of the damage during any subsequent pre flight inspection
3917388 john macdougall gave more than 30 years of distinguished public service to fife as a councillor leader of fife council convener of fife council and then mp for central fife he will be remembered as a true servant of the people
3917389 a very popular diligent local mp he served fife with great distinction in all the roles he played
3917390 in fife he pioneered free travel for the elderly led scotland and britain with nursery education for three and four year olds was successful in pressing for new jobs and investment to replace thousands of jobs lost in mining and at rosyth naval base and was well known for his support for all local causes
3917391 over three decades he has been a good personal friend of mine
3917392 our heartfelt condolences go to his widow cathy to his son and daughter scott and julie and to his mother and sister
3917393 i was very sad to hear of the death of john macdougall and my thoughts are with his wife and children at this difficult time
3917394 john was an excellent mp and will be sadly missed by colleagues of all parties
3917395 he was a doughty fighter for the people of fife over many years as a trade unionist long standing councillor and dedicated member of parliament
3917396 i am saddened that john has lost his long and brave fight against illness and our condolences go to his wife and family at this very difficult time
3917397 we may have been on opposite sides in the commons but john carried the respect of people right across the chamber and was passionate for the issues he believed in and the welfare of his constituents which he cared about deeply
3917398 i have greatly admired the way in which he has borne such a debilitating illness with enormous courage
3917399 my thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time
3917400 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mr mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3917401 might include a bilateral agreement with either of the other two parties
3917402 it isnt normally a problem up there the dogs were all just jumping about as they always do but there was nothing to stop della when she got knocked towards the water and dropped straight over the waterfall
3917403 i tried to fight my way to the water but i couldnt get down and couldnt see her
3917404 she is an important part of the family i was devastated i went back in the morning and saw what looked like this white speckled rock
3917405 i shouted down and it started moving i called the fire brigade and they came out to help it took them an hour to find a place to secure ropes and abseil down and rescue her
3917406 i didnt expect to find her i was sure she would be dead
3917407 she is lucky to be alive and she only has a couple of bruises which is a miracle considering what she has been through
3917408 we didnt expect the dog to be found alive as the water was rising and very powerful she was found about 40m down from where she fell so she has been through a lot and is lucky to be alive
3917409 i had responsibility as the person who had planned and organised it
3917410 i shouted is everyone safe the answer came back that they were
3917411 it was impossible to count because some people were trying to get on the boat with me and some had been rescued
3917412 i never took into account the possibility of a capsize
3917413 after experiencing the event when i was in the water myself i could not possibly do the job i was up to my neck in water
3917414 do you accept this was exceptionally bad planning on your part
3917415 nothing happened for absolutely ages after we put the concert on sale i just got nothing but apologies from them
3917416 with julian we would normally have sold a lot more tickets
3917417 he was a very romantic composer a lot of his works have come alive since he died in 1982
3917418 this will probably be the longest piece of his i have ever performed
3917419 you caught me in this adrenalin moment in 15 minutes you will have a dead conductor
3917420 scottish opera was asked to play this and said yes
3917421 if you are feeling completely brain dead it is a really easy laugh its really quite therapeutic
3917422 i have endured that stigma for 15 years its fair to say it has ruined my life yet until now i have never received the slightest apology from the authorities for my ordeal
3917423 a lot of wild figures had been bandied about but what i wanted more than money was for people to realise they got it wrong
3917424 i thought the establishment would just make a token payment but this is like winning the lottery what pleases me even more than the money is that this is effectively a public apology
3917425 but nothing can compensate for the trauma and stress of the past 15 years
3917426 manipulation and deception some of it of a highly reprehensible kind
3917427 i am quite satisfied that this amounts to misconduct in the investigation and prosecution of this case and i categorise it egregious
3917428 it will be a telephone based service that would offer advice related to alcohol consumption
3917429 it would be aimed at people who may not have a major alcohol problem
3917430 but it might be that someone goes to their gp or to a amp e with a condition or injury which may be linked to alcohol
3917431 they could then be referred to a special phoneline where they may receive information on safe levels of drinking and other advice
3917432 i am hugely disappointed not to be able to attend the festival of politics this year
3917433 once i am back on my feet it will be my imperative to come back up to edinburgh at the earliest opportunity
3917434 he will be asked difficult questions about did a slap never do a woman any harm for example
3917435 isaf soldiers are trained to take the appropriate steps to minimise civilian casualties
3917436 however they must take action to protect themselves when threatened
3917437 tragic incidents such as this are avoidable if the public comply with the instructions of those who are endeavouring to provide a safe environment
3917438 isaf runs frequent public service announcements and advertising campaigns aimed at keeping the local population informed about the need to maintain a safe distance from isaf convoys as they travel throughout the region
3917439 this incident is being investigated and our thoughts are with those injured civilians and their families at this time
3917440 you know id prefer almost no challenge at all and massively less valuble degree if i dont make the nfl
3917441 the ncaa continues to put profit over principle by continuing to embrace advertising for beer the number one cause of alcohol problems during its popular sports telecasts in contrast the ncaa rejects advertising for distilled spirits most wine sports wagering gambling nightclubs firearms and weapons and nc 17 rated motion pictures among others
3917442 most businesses in oregon agree that on the job substance abuse is a major problem
3917443 but while larger employers have comprehensive workplace programs in place most small businesses dont know where to begin this gives them a head start

3917469 potential users are likely to include both first time buyers seeking a low cost introductory pc as well as experienced users seeking a low cost second or third pc for themselves or a relative
3917470 pc vendors will need to pay increasing attention to the design and ease of use of mini notebooks

3917472 we feel it is important to provide open source developers with a platform to showcase their new and innovative applications to help them cultivate beneficial business relationships

3917527 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades

3917575 the introduction of the care records system on the wycombe and amersham sites has continued to present some challenges for the infection control team
3917576 these have mainly focused around the inability to remove any mrsa flags entered in error the disappearing of the flag on the bed board when a patient moves wards bed spaces and the intermittent omission of a yellow star against flagged patients in powerchart
3917577 work has been undertaken across the domain with the help of the strategic health authority to agree a solution a fix has been developed and implementation is planned for early april 2008
3917578 the fix went in on 9 april the benefit of this is that the problems we had had prior to this were resolved
3917579 the historical mrsa infection alerts needed to be put onto the crs system manually following go live
3917580 this took approximately six weeks to do during which time there was a possibility that some mrsa positive patients may have slipped through undetected if medical notes were not available there have been several other problems with the system which have resulted in a small number of patients not being isolated promptly
3917581 it is apparent that mid and south bucks and nuffield orthopaedic centre use the mrsa flag to show historical and current cases the fix that fujitsu will bring in will means that workflow processes will need to change for these sites
3917582 milton keynes work differently and want the fix we will have problems with downstream reporting if the fix is applied
3917583 was of vital importance for the trust and we would not be prepared to roll out to stoke mandeville hospital without the ability to monitor this infection
3917584 a c difficile enhancement has been turned down by cfh due to associated costs
3917585 developed into an untenable situation which resulted in near melt down of the acute organisation
3917586 when we know ourselves when we see that god is the reason for our groaning then we achieve an insight that gives us confidence in the greatest and deepest sadness we see death in the light of life we justify god who by his spirit causes us to groan in this tent we see the necessity of death and of the no in transitoriness they are needed to free a place as they do their work true life comes closer we are closer to the goal of being clothed upon with our heavenly dwelling

3917590 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3917591 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3917592 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3917593 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3917594 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3917595 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3917596 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3917597 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3917598 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3917599 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3917600 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3917601 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3917602 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3917603 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3917604 carlos el caballo lee was officially euthanized at 3 17 am today
3917605 our thoughts and prayers are with his trainer and his family he had a lot of heart he will be missed
3917606 i felt so bad for the big guy hes been a real spark to the team and he plays every game with such enthusiasm but it was pretty obvious what we were going to have to do
3917607 i credit the training staff for at least getting him off the field we had a whole contingent of boy scouts in the stands and little kids really dont need to see that i called down to cecil cooper astros manager and told him what i thought we had to do he begged to at least wait until we could get him x rayed
3917608 i knew in the back of my head it was over for the poor guy but i had to hope maybe it wasnt as bad as it looked
3917609 i had the trainers take him back to the locker room area and get him x rayed i cried for an hour when i found out he had broken his hand in six places we had a lot of time and money invested in him and now thats gone poor el caballo we will truly miss him
3917610 he was in a lot of pain but being the fighter he is he wouldnt admit it it made my job so much harder having to listen to him yell and scream about him being a person and not a horse poor poor el caballo such pain such denial oh why couldnt he just go quietly into the night
3917611 i think they are most definitely going to be psyched out
3917612 we have a psychologist around and were going to make sure shell talk to the team what happened here will play on their minds
3917613 i didnt feel like i lost the fight because i was doing everything the coaches were telling me
3917614 i wasnt telling him to stop being aggressive maybe he couldnt hear me with all the noise
3917615 i dont know how to better represent them than to sit here with a gold medal in my hand
3917616 i dove in and they goggles just filled right up with water it got worse and worse through the race and the last 75 meters going into the 150 wall and the finish i couldnt see the wall i was just hoping i was winning and hoping i could get my hand on the wall first thats sort of why i ripped my goggles off real quick because i was kind of upset that it happened but i saw that i did a best time and was happy
3917617 when i was on the stand for the award ceremony for the 200 fly i started thinking about it and thats when i started tearing up to be at the top with so many great athletes whove walked in these olympic games its a pretty amazing feeling
3917618 it definitely feels good to be the first country ever to dip under the seven minute barrier
3917619 i havent really slept from the other night so i think tonight ill be able to get a good nights sleep and then come back and recover and swim faster tomorrow
3917620 i dont care about times im just going to go out there and swim the best that i can and hopefully get on the podium
3917621 that wasnt that good its disappointing but ill get myself ready to go in the 50 in the couple of days
3917622 it was good but its over with and i have to move on to the next race i wasnt thinking about that at all
3917623 i thought i tied for eighth and was going to have a swim off
3917624 after several tests we decided to put lin miaoke on the live picture while using yang peiyis voice
3917625 the reason for this is that we must put our countrys interests first the girl appearing on the picture must be flawless in terms of her facial expressions and the great feeling she can give to the people
3917626 making it to the playoffs was a great accomplishment but we could have done better top to bottom
3917627 we had chemistry problems that held us back and thats with players the coaching staff and the front office weve got to get better and more professional everywhere
3917628 for some americans traitor is the first thing that comes to their mind said kaman who has german grandparents
3917629 but im happy with my decision i chose to go with my heritage a little further back
3917630 my dad told me youre not german youre american he said
3917631 when youre playing the usa im rooting for usa i hope they beat you
3917632 we like the formation it tends to balance out defenses and forces them to eliminate some of the things they do not everything obviously but we like the formation
3917633 whether or not we can play it as much as we have in the past is just going to depend on stuff as it happens
3917634 my role is to catch whatever is thrown at me if they want me to go deep ill catch it and if they want me to stay short ill catch it i like the role of being the guy that they want in on goal line situations
3917635 after four years and many nightmares i have white hair
3917636 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u
3917637 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3917638 all these years there was only one gold medal for us in team final in sydney in athens we wanted to have the same result unfortunately we fell this gold medal in our homeland offers redemption each of our six men had to do his utmost
3917639 no i was not scared going last on high bar because all my big brothers had a big performance
3917640 i really relaxed did my routine and felt no pressure
3917641 we actually had eight camps and we tried to increase our difficulty at each of them and we couldnt catch up
3917642 we want to learn from the chinese and get better
3917643 im not satisfied staying in af2 i can improve some things but i think im definitely good enough to get to the afl and make an impact
3917644 there were some guys there with athletic ability but didnt know anything
3917645 a lot of people were eliminated early but they got down to 15 and i was able to show them what i can do
3917646 at first i thought he may be a non resident indian from canada or united states
3917647 weve got so much talent surrounding the quarterback its going to be hard for them to lose a game
3917648 with the coaching staff we have we can make adjustments throughout the game and put our quarterbacks in the best position possible well be fine
3917649 the guy that is least likely to turn it over least likely to make poor decisions
3917650 weve just got to make good decisions and get the ball to our guys because weve got a lot of talent
3917651 i was in the outside lane so it was kind of difficult for the others to see me
3917652 i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on
3917653 i think a lot of people in the race knew that he was not necessarily toying around with us the first two swims but saving energy and being a smart racer i think everyone knew that he was capable of 52 mid so really the race was for second and going into it i kind of knew that so i got what id hoped for
3917654 i was absolutely elated it was just a wonderful race
3917655 i was a little disappointed with the time but totally not disappointed with a silver medal its an honor to even get a medal at the olympic games
3917656 i was super nervous i knew natalie was going to have a great race and any race when youre going up against the olympic champion youre going to feel it
3917657 oh lift high the banner the flag of zimbabwe the symbol of freedom proclaiming victory
3917658 everyone at home is just so proud to be zimbabwean and im just lucky enough to be able to give that to the people at home and be able to make them proud and kind of feel that positive light
3917659 i hope by the end of this meet i can do that i have two more chances
3917660 as the years have progressed and ive gotten older its gotten faster and faster and its more of a sprint four 50s one of each stroke a sprint just go
3917661 hes a great guy too he considers me competition but in a friendly way a fellow u s teammate so he gave me a private lesson during the training trip and i learned how he swims it
3917662 you never have to worry about it when hes in the lineup you know hes going to put together some good at bats
3917663 everything has been building to this moment it is our chance to shine
3917664 china and the u s are the class of the world
3917665 they are the top two and theyre sure to fight it out for most of the gold medals
3917666 we got all of our jitters out of the way early
3917667 it gives us something that will motivate us and push to be even stronger
3917668 it really meant something to me because hes a huge superstar
3917669 the three of us here we cant even express how excited we are to be a part of this team
3917670 i had more adrenalin going than i ever had in my life
3917671 i dont remember a word any of us had to say
3917672 we didnt want to let them stick around we wanted to let the crowd know that we were ready to play
3917673 in 2004 i won the gold medal for myself today i won it for all my supporters and fans
3917674 there are similarities between shooting in the wild and at competitions
3917675 dove hunting definitely helps here because the target presentations are similar
3917676 i can guarantee it wont be like that the rest of the tournament
3917677 we really struggled but our big players really came through at the end
3917678 westwood was tough this was a great match good crowd loud lots of intensity
3917679 this was a tough loss but it shows that we can play with anybody
3917680 hi shaula i have not turned on my computer for
3917681 both sound good though cucumber and watermelon are things i
3917682 the wow factor has been really high for us too
3917683 shaula the postcard idea is a great one i would

3917685 it broke my heart to see all the highway signs
3917686 if you are in burlington its insanely close to mtl
3917687 the renovations are gorgeous in the last picture the people
3917688 to come off the terrible month that we had in cincinnati and you get a phone call today saying youre being traded to a first place team thats all you could ask for
3917689 i havent run into the guys with the bags on their heads
3917690 maybe theyre still out there but i couldnt see them i didnt know who they were
3917691 thats a good feeling to be back and being in a situation where we can have a good team and go out eventually whenever that is on a good note
3917692 hes always talking always encouraging us always coaching us all at once
3917693 youd never know he was 61 its unbelievable how much energy he has
3917694 i just needed to be reminded how good he is as a coach and certainly as a position coach
3917695 in the meeting rooms hes just outstanding hes going to make a big impact
3917696 i dont know that bitter is the term anytime you try to do something and it doesnt work out its disappointing
3917697 the reason i got into coaching was because i like being around the players
3917698 sometimes the coordinator and the head coach is more of a manager than he is a teacher so i am very comfortable with what im doing im happy

3917702 such a symbol is meaningless until your company can communicate to consumers what its underlying associations are
3917703 there are a lot of freelance designers who charge rates ranging from 15 to 150 per hour based on their experience
3917704 remember that a good logo should last at least 10 years if you look at the amortization of that cost over a 10 year period it doesnt seem so bad

3917708 demand has been so much in the last couple of days that banks and other importers have run out of supplies
3917709 if the price keeps falling theres no reason why people wont continue to buy
3917710 buyers who have been pushing back purchases for too long will relish current prices
3917711 retail buyers with festivals around the corner will lap up gold at these prices
3917712 there is evidence of a strong revival in physical interest in the middle east and indian jewelers are restocking
3917713 this is an important early sign that gold which is now relatively free from weak professional holders may be preparing for a bounce as we approach the autumn
3917714 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection

3917734 die m dchen und jungen bekommen schon im kindergarten deutschkurse in der dritten und vierten klasse kommen dozenten der uni dortmund zu uns um die kinder intensiv auf die n chste schulstufe vorzubereiten

3917750 no han hecho otra cosa sino someterse a la voluntad del presidente de la rep blica
3917751 hemos visto nuevamente en este nuevo episodio de la reforma de contrabando como todos los poderes p blicos se arrodillan ante la voluntad del jefe de estado lav ndose las manos de su responsabilidad la asamblea nacional le otorg poderes al presidente por un lapso de 18 meses para legislar en cualquier materia luego observamos como el tribunal supremo de justicia le concedi el car cter org nico a las leyes y en el d a de ayer le toc al poder moral con las tristes declaraciones de la fiscal general de la rep blica
3917752 la fiscal general act a como una vocera m s del partido de gobierno

3917764 oh that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory that your hand be with me that you would keep me from evil that i may not cause pain
3917765 we sympathise with the plight of those working in the local fishing industry but the call to reduce duties remains with the ministry of finance and more importantly with cabinet
3917766 out of the 60 boats on local fishing scene only 18 are left operating in the next six weeks there will be no industry left to help
3917767 the funny thing is that foreign vessels enjoy more concession than local companies there is a difference of 30 cents to 40 cents on fuel bait and fishing gear that is offered to foreign fishing vessels and they employ foreign staff as well
3917768 what is 10 cents or 12 cents going to do to help the industry when we outright can not compete with foreign boats
3917769 i have been putting food on the table for my workers for the past 25 years and when this is all over can the ministry of finance and fisheries justify to my workers why they have been unable to do anything
3917770 the result is that an on going consultative interest based dispute resolution process is in place that matl and landowners have agreed to use to mitigate and resolve adverse impacts of the project
3917771 until a higher authority states otherwise that permit is now in place and the company has the legal ability to build that line
3917772 as we move forward in designing surveying and building this project we will take significant care to be an outstanding corporate citizen
3917773 oversee the clinical research and academic enterprise for wake forest baptist reporting to the medical centers board of directors
3917774 dr mcconnell is clearly positioned and experienced to lead us with an understanding that encompasses the evolution of physician practices the prominent role of research in a medical center administration and an abiding focus on patient care
3917775 this is a practice commonly used in the healthcare industry every major academic medicine in america has such a program it has nothing to do with medical care
3917776 i am not aware of any such special access or free services the only free care i know of is for poor people who qualify for charity care
3917777 as far as we are concerned every patient who enters the medical center will receive select treatment
3917778 i think phelps has been really important the drama and the results of the events he has been involved in have been extraordinary
3917779 were living with four dollar gas high food prices and families unable to afford summer vacations americans need something to cheer for and this olympics and this us team is filling that need

3917784 a family of four can come out here for two days and really not participate in all the activities from atvs to a family pool to a zip line climbing walls a zoo petting all the animals

3917801 russian forces shall withdraw to the positions they had held prior to the start of hostilities awaiting an international mechanism russian peacekeepers shall implement additional security measures
3917802 opening international discussions on the modalities of sustainable security in abkhazia and south ossetia based on decisions by the united nations and the osce
3917803 it is absolutely understandable perfectly normal that russia wants to defend uphold the interests of its own citizens compatriots and russian speaking people beyond the borders of outside russia
3917804 russians bombed the btc pipeline south of the city of rustavi
3917805 the russian military is posing a direct threat to the kulevi oil terminal the property of the azerbaijani oil company socar state oil company of the azerbaijani republic they have demanded that the terminal staff evacuate as russians are preparing to bomb the nearby forest claiming that georgian troops are hidden there the president of azerbaijan mr ilham aliyev is currently trying to convince the russian leadership to prevent this barbaric act from happening
3917806 turkey is ready to play a key role in making this alliance a reality but this idea needs to be discussed under un auspices to become practicable
3917807 always reminds you and others when you show it to them that you were able to afford this its a work of art with no hidden function at all

3917817 eric clapton did not play the very famous first riff on the song
3917818 the administration hoped that their name wouldnt be attached to yet another escape under their watch
3917819 i think they were trying to cover it up at the expense of the public
3917820 so the public is aware that there is a potential public safety threat
3917821 if my daughter and two grandchildren are traveling in that area i want them to hear a radio report and be on the lookout the public has a right to know
3917822 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient
3917823 for seven countries to come together without an eighth country that has happened over the last few days
3917824 i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3917825 the events in georgia over the last 5 days have shocked me people throughout the u k and the international community
3917826 russias use of force in a sovereign and democratic country is unacceptable and unjustifiable
3917827 i think that the russia government is taking advantage of the fact that the u s soft power is in decline and that the eu has a very elastic conception of sovereignty
3917828 im worried we might be in a rock paper scissors situation and that they the russians are definitely on the rock side i think they are betting that rock trumps paper
3917829 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3917830 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3917831 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3917832 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
3917833 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3917834 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3917835 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3917836 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
3917837 given the stalling disposal programme we now believe it is appropriate to bring friends into line with our cautious opinion on the other uk domestic life companies
3917838 is exposed to the cyclical slowdown and increasing competitive industry pressures
3917839 reflected in a dramatic relative fall in mans share price
3917840 we believe it is too early to cut estimates but clearly confidence in our numbers has been eroded by the short term negative returns both in ahl and the hedge fund industry generally
3917841 until such time as they consider it prudent to pay them
3917842 given the delay in achieving forecasted sales exacerbated by the continued overall negative economic sentiment found in the uk administrative expenditure since the end of march has continued to be handled tightly as a result of the delay in sales the balance of cash used to finance ongoing general administrative expenditure has not been supplemented from cash generated from trading activities as anticipated
3917843 the capital expenditure involved in the development to date has resulted in a significant working capital shortfall
3917844 letzter versuch der besuch eines der wie schwammerln aus dem boden wachsenden in lokale
3917845 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose
3917846 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3917847 obviously meant a lot to saakashvili personally but more importantly the message it conveyed to the georgian people in this really time of unprecedented national emergency
3917848 we should realize what is at stake here for americans
3917849 we tax the dead in my party may as well take votes from them too

3917863 the state could hire some shrill or half insane retired judge to act as the star of the show
3917864 many professionals in film and television also work in the meeting and event industries so catering to both industries in one place is a natural fit
3917865 our objective is to connect the many talented individuals in and around san diego with companies in search of their abilities by facilitating this connection we hope to raise awareness of the incredible production personnel and capabilities that san diego has to offer
3917866 each organization is striving to increase the visibility of san diego in these industries and stimulate the local economy at 360 live we feel that giving local filmmakers and the businesses looking to hire them a single resource to consult will streamline the process for everyone
3917867 we carefully studied successful online directories from other markets and from various industries and developed our database accordingly
3917868 everyone involved with 360 live calls san diego home and our foremost goal is to see the local film and television scene continue to prosper eventually we would like to offer that same opportunity to professionals in other cities throughout the united states

3917870 without him this building and many others would not be here but its more than the bricks and mortar this ultimately leads to better education research patient care and service to the state of west virginia
3917871 while we have more to accomplish today i am so very proud to add the erma byrd biomedical research center and the health sciences learning center to that list of facilities that will help transform the unthinkable into realities that will improve the lives of the people of west virginia and advance modern medicine

3917874 as a significant unitholder and as a continuing director i look forward to working with the new ceo
3917875 ken was instrumental in the creation of petrowest and in bringing together a group of private companies that are well positioned to deliver strong performances
3917876 we thank ken for his dedication and commitment to building value despite numerous industry challenges his insight and vision of what petrowest can and will be has set the stage for a strong recovery
3917877 my father is 67 years old and spends a lot of time sitting there and crying now just thinking about what s happened it s very emotional
3917878 the defendant city of toronto permitted sunrise to locate and operate on the premises and to carry on its dangerous operation in the vicinity of residential homes and business
3917879 the explosion and the consequent damages in the city of toronto was caused by the negligence of the defendants their agents servants or employees
3917880 technical violations of the propane code were discovered such as a hose hanging from a truck
3917881 no one should speculate based on the results of its previous inspections as to what may or may not have caused the explosion
3917882 the more firepower the better so the city and the province and sunrise know what they re up against
3917883 their lives have been disrupted the case involves not only loss or damage to them personally but i believe the case raises fundamental issues of public responsibility
3917884 if it were my child i wouldn t be worried
3917885 this increase in total revenue caused by increased commodity pricing was partially offset by a reduction in the company s production in the period
3917886 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie
3917887 i loved the prestige but i didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so fucking smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what fuck dc comics thats all i have to say and that is where i am coming from

3917890 in every area of life cognitive emotional social developmental at every phase of the life cycle social evidence shows that there are measurable effects when children lack either a mother or a father the evidence is overwhelming mountains of evidence collected over decades show that children need both mothers and fathers
3917891 the state of florida wanted me to argue that the reason the ban should be upheld was because homosexuals made bad parents and i refused to do that i said in my testimony if two homosexuals wanted to adopt a child i would have no objection to it
3917892 what mattered more was that the man and woman homosexual or not were willing to act contrary to their own desires in making the sacrifice to provide a stable home for the child
3917893 what counts is the willingness to put ones own desires in second place it has nothing to do with homosexuality per se its the fact that if two men or two women insist on adopting a child they thereby prove by their insistence that they know nothing about the needs of the child and are so selfish and ignorant of what children need that by their very insistence they prove themselves unfit to be parents
3917894 few homosexual relationships last longer than two years with many men reporting hundreds of lifetime partners
3917895 the most important study of american sexual behavior since the kinsey reports

3917897 even though many of the people who are fueling this push for legalized gay marriage are acting out of genuine compassion their sentiments are sadly misdirected
3917898 all they can think about are the rights of the adults
3917899 only one other american state recognizes the right the majority announces today so far congress and virtually every other court to consider the issue has rejected it nothing in our constitution express or implicit compels the majoritys startling conclusion that the age old understanding of marriage an understanding recently confirmed by an initiative law is no longer valid i cannot join this exercise in legal jujitsu by which the legislatures own weight is used against it to create a constitutional right from whole cloth defeat the peoples will and invalidate a statute otherwise immune from legislative interference the majority simply does not have the right to erase then recast the age old definition of marriage as virtually all societies have understood it in order to satisfy its own contemporary notions of equality and justice
3917900 i dont believe we are cannibalizing ourselves in any way
3917901 and right now were the only film out there in wide release

3917906 i was really upset in the morning and i didnt really understand why its like a feeling you get
3917907 to be brutally honest yeah i think if you just look at the past few seasons it kind of proves that theres always cute boys at the end which is cool i think the girls going into this kind of know that and they expect that and theres been girl winners now there will be another guy winner
3917908 things are going to be very tough in the second half of the year
3917909 it may still just be summer but there is a feeling of chill in the economic air

3917922 suddenly inflammation has become one of the hottest areas of medical research hardly a week goes by without the publication of yet another study uncovering a new way that chronic inflammation does harm to the body it destabilizes cholesterol deposits in the coronary arteries leading to heart attacks and potentially even strokes
3917923 for the first time we have hard clinical evidence that lowering inflammation lowers the risk of heart attack and stroke and cardiovascular disease
3917924 rather than concentrating only on lowering cholesterol you need to understand the necessary steps to decreasing the cause of inflammation in your arteries this approach could have significant and dramatic implications in the prevention and reversal of heart diseases
3917925 elevated serum homocysteine is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease and heart attack
3917926 40 major clinical studies now confirm that homocysteine levels are a predictive marker for heart disease stroke and peripheral artery disease

3918001 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly
3918002 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3918003 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
3918004 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
3918005 fadel shanas death is a tragedy a journalist in action was killed by idf israel defence force fire along with others not involved in the hostilities however the available evidence does not suggest misconduct or criminal misbehaviour i have therefore decided that no further legal measures will be taken
3918006 the idfs decision to close its probe without taking any disciplinary action is the latest in a long line of cases clearing its soldiers of deadly negligence
3918007 the fpa believes the army is obligated to clearly identify its targets before firing especially in areas where civilians and journalists are present

3918024 its really surprising that he pulled off the robbery since hes trying to cover his face with one hand and then hes holding the gun with the other hand
3918025 and in the meantime hes having to pull up his pants at the same time
3918026 in that apartment building they struck a juvenile twice in the face and dragged the juveniles at gunpoint down to the porch area
3918027 while on the porch they had the juveniles lay face down pointing the guns at the juveniles face and then into his mouth demanding that he tell them who threw the rocks or they would kill them
3918028 hes overprotective of kids i wouldnt dare think they he would do this to anybodys child
3918029 hes a decorated officer weve done our own investigation and are very confident he will be completely vindicated in this process
3918030 a relationship is like a garden if you tend to your garden with care attention and maintenance it will grow give it plenty of sunshine and water and the seedlings will mature into strong healthy plants neglect it and hope for the best and it will overrun with weeds step on the plants tear their leaves deny them love and nutrients and they will wither and die if you treat your relationship with appreciation and respect it will remain strong if you give it your time attention and effort it will continue to grow with each passing day however if you take it for granted and assume it will just continue along as it is chances are it too will wither and die it can be so easy to take a love relationship for granted once the hard part of finding and creating love is done many people then declare themselves set and turn their attention to other areas they check it off their list of things they need to do a relationship however is an ever evolving entity that demands nurturing in order to survive like a garden it has basic requirements when the first harvest season is over it still needs to be cared for with love appreciation and respect if it is to continue to bloom year after year nurturing the connection between your partner and you is what sustains your relationship that connection must be reinforced each and every day to remain strong this reinforcement is not something only to be done annually on anniversaries or birthdays but rather it must become as normal to you as waking up in the morning and brushing your teeth it is easy to feel his magic in the beginning of your relationship when passions are high and emotions are flowing the challenge is to maintain it through daily sustenance and nurturing of each other at the heart of nurturing your relationship is the act of treasuring your beloved treasuring your beloved means that you hold him dear to you it means that you appreciate him for all his wonderful qualities and demonstrate as often as you can how important and special he is to you in the act of treasuring you show your partner in direct and subtle ways that he is the person who still makes your heart race and your stomach flutter you show him that he contributes to the beauty of your life

3918057 saya mencadangkan supaya negeri negeri ini mewujudkan koridor kuasa pr bagi memperteguh urus tadbir kerajaan dan pengurusan ekonomi
3918058 hasil bumi yang kaya ini mesti dimanfaatkan secara terancang untuk kebaikan bersama jaringan kerjasama ekonomi dan persefahaman politik mesti dibuat dengan segera
3918059 saya menggesa supaya sebuah jawatankuasa pemandu pr di peringkat pusat diwujudkan supaya dasar dasar kerajaan pr dapat diselaraskan agihan sumber dan rancanganpembangunan bersama juga dapat diaturkan sehingga kita dapat menanganisekatan politik dan ekonomi yang dilakukan oleh
3918060 jawatankuasa pemandu ini perlu berperanan agar lima buah negeri pr ini menjadi satu persekutuan yang saling bahu membahu dalam mengekalkan keyakinan dan kepuasan rakyat
3918061 kita mesti menghormati dasar dan tujuan perjuangan rakan rakan kita tetapi dalam masa yang sama mereka juga harus menghormati kita jika kita saling mempersoalkan dasar orang lain maka selagi itu pakatan ini tidak akan kukuh
3918062 islam yang didukung oleh pas tidak pernah menzalimi atau menganiayai sesiapa termasuk bukan islam bahkan islamlah satu satu sistem pemerintahan yang telah terbukti memberikan keadilan kepada semua manusia seperti yang terakam dalam sejarah khulafa
3918063 pas berdiri tegak dan teguh sehingga hari ini kerana perjuangan islam yang dilihat dan diyakini konsisten dap terus relevan di persada politik kerana nilai dan prinsip social democrat socialistic inclination yang dipertahankan manakala pkr terus mara dengan slogan keadilan untuk semua
3918064 saya mengajak pimpinan pemuda pr melangkah ke hadapan dengan nilai sejagat perjuangan ini serta membuktikan kepada malaysia dan dunia bahawa kita mampu merealisasikan citi cita perjuangan kita dengan penuh tanggungjawab
3918065 saya tidak rela untuk terperangkap dan terjerumus dalam jebak dan konflikpermusuhan yang tak kunjung sudah yang mengheret kita pemuda pr untukterus bersangka buruk dan membiarkan minda rakyat terus dibelenggu olehmomokan dan persepsi pas dengan islam yang ganas serta dap dengan sikapchauvanisnya atau parti perkauman cinanya

3918068 on behalf of the democratic party our thoughts and prayers are with chairman gwatneys family and friends and the extended democratic family in arkansas with this senseless act of violence we have lost a good friend and honorable man bill will be remembered for his hard work and dedication to the party and he will be sorely missed
3918069 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
3918070 the oceans keep new zealand cooler than the rest of the world since 1950 new zealand has warmed by 0 4 c thank you pacific ocean
3918071 when the focus groups looked at the altered photos they used unflattering terms such as unattractive and aggressive to describe the individuals
3918072 but when groups saw photos of the same individuals with a healthy beautiful smile they were more likely to view the individuals as intelligent attractive and a friend id like to have sadly as the summer games experience shows attitudes have not improved since this study was published
3918073 theres a correlation between the condition of the teeth and mouth and the condition of the body when the teeth and jaws are aligned they function better and there may be less dental disease with good teeth its easier to bite chew and eat a variety of healthy foods good fuel contributes to good health its a win win
3918074 even with baby teeth present orthodontists are able to spot subtle problems that can evolve into obvious problems as adult teeth emerge
3918075 weve got so much money going out in so many directions it just seems to me there are better places we could use it
3918076 once that moneys established in the budget you dont have to pass anything sneary said
3918077 when you consider the alternative the option is to spend that much or more to tear that building down and create another parking lot
3918078 for the cost of one third of the elevator were going to end up with a very very rentable venue the civic center can use and a great building to me its a good choice
3918079 westernone enjoyed overall sales growth compared to the same period last year
3918080 we have achieved this by continuing to execute our expansion strategy with a focus of acquiring companies with exceptional management in place
3918081 in q2 westernone had several significant achievements in may westernone received approval for the listing of its units and series a debentures on the toronto stock exchange and in june westernone launched a new equipment rental location in lethbridge alberta as we continue to grow our businesses we have been diligently working to position ourselves for long term earnings growth and sustainable distributions
3918082 organic growth and accretive acquisitions continue to facilitate growth for us as demonstrated in our quarterly financial results
3918083 as we are approaching the high point of the annual construction industry and equipment rental cycles westernone will continue to focus on enhancing profitability and generating incremental distributable cash for our unitholders with the goal of reducing the payout percentage in the second half of the year

3918088 this gray area is very gray very dark and its hard for people who want to do this exactly the way theyre supposed to its hard for people to know how to do it hoey has paid his taxes and hes prepared to rectify his tax statements but its really difficult to know how to do that
3918089 from the time these chicks were collected in norway and brought over to scotland in june ive watch them grow up and now theyre raring to go
3918090 im really excited to see where they go and if theyll meet up with last years birds
3918091 were open sufficiently for me to see this man whom we had got to know over a period of 10 days lying dead face uncovered propped up on white pillows
3918092 he tried to hit a nurse fortunately he didnt succeed for 24 hours a day this man shouted laughed swore and sang at the top of his voice
3918093 so effectively we had three other very ill men who had no sleep day or night
3918094 the normal practice if someone has died in a four bedded ward is to access a single room where the deceased could be viewed by the family and the family can have some time with the relative and for that to be done in as dignified manner as possible
3918095 this case highlights the campaign were running and highlights the kind of problems nurses come across because no nurse would want a deceased patient lying on a ward for seven hours
3918096 we have acknowledged to the martins that beyond this there was some delay in the transfer of the patient to the mortuary and steps have already been taken to ensure that this does not happen again
3918097 a new model for cancer care is required that addresses the whole experience of the patient and not just management of their disease
3918098 we have to treat the person as well as the disease this means that as well as making sure people in scotland can have the best medical management for their cancer we must also provide support for the social and psychological issues that people with cancer have identified as being important to them
3918099 everyone diagnosed with cancer wants the best possible treatment but they also want and deserve the best possible care they are not necessarily the same thing
3918100 any research which tries to truly understand and improve the experience of people affected by cancer is to be very much welcomed and encouraged
3918101 speaking as a person with cancer the report emphasises what the elephant in the room is surviving is of primary importance but the experience of this good bad or indifferent is not being used to shape the delivery of service and the survivorship of the treatment further
3918102 there is nothing to lose and everything to gain by including patient experiences at every level treatment management and how we as patients and survivors can contribute to research
3918103 although scotland has made significant improvements in services for people with cancer over the past decade it is evident from this research that in relation to improving the experiences of people affected by cancer more needs to be done
3918104 the cost of fuel is clearly hitting new zealanders hard enough to make them change their behaviour
3918105 the fact that this latest poll was taken in winter is also interesting as youd expect people would turn to their cars more when the weather is bad
3918106 perhaps it shows that we often drive our cars short distances that could easily be walked instead
3918107 he was in absolute fear of his life and trembling
3918108 ill teach you to show me the f ing red card you so and so
3918109 they didnt take anything important just souvenir medallions and brass crowns from statues
3918110 whats more serious is the hole in the stained glass window
3918111 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3918112 in a way russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3918113 yes i want to be an american caroler or theater captain
3918114 is that what you plan to say on judgment day
3918115 is hard to put in a comedy but we had to do it
3918116 the lesson for plaintiffs is in the vast majority of cases they are perceiving the defendants offer to be half a loaf when in fact it is an entire loaf or more
3918117 i n just 15 percent of cases both sides were right to go to trial meaning that the defendant paid less than the plaintiff had wanted but the plaintiff got more than the defendant had offered

3918119 gop lawmakers hope to use their leverage over the state budget which cannot pass without some of their votes to roll back landmark policies implemented by democrats
3918120 rules dictating when employers must provide lunch breaks for workers
3918121 merely show s that he did not take them regardless of the reason
3918122 an employer must do something affirmative to provide a meal period
3918123 obligation to provide employees with an adequate meal period is not satisfied merely by assuming that the meal periods were taken
3918124 in 1989 when cellphones were huge and when it cost a lot of money to make a phone call
3918125 nowadays theyre a dime a dozen and the cost is way down if you dont log all your telephone calls youre going to have some irs weenie after you thats why were trying to get the law changed because it just doesnt make any sense anymore
3918126 a published decision and its rulings are therefore binding upon the dlse
3918127 must provide meal periods by making them available but need not ensure that they are taken employers however cannot impede discourage or dissuade employees from taking meal periods
3918128 a n employer must make a first 30 minute meal period available to an hourly employee who is permitted to work more than five hours per day unless 1 the employee is permitted to work a total work period per day that is six hours or less or 2 both the employee and the employer agreed by
3918129 employers must provide rest periods but need not ensure that they are taken employers however cannot impede discourage or dissuade employees from taking rest periods
3918130 reported within 30 days after the expiration of the policy
3918131 preserving the right to take meal and rest breaks is critical
3918132 ups reported that in the first eight months of 2007 it issued 7 200 disciplinary citations and fired 22 workers for meal break violations
3918133 an employer may not employ an employee for a work period of more than five hours per day without providing the employee with a meal period of not less than 30 minutes
3918134 a work period of more than five hours per day
3918135 one additional hour of pay at the employees regular rate
3918136 to provide an employee a meal period in accordance with an applicable order of the industrial welfare commission
3918137 consistent with the health and welfare of the affected employees
3918138 i was treated like so many of my co workers
3918139 there was just too much work to do and never enough time to do it there just wasnt enough time in the day to take the breaks we were entitled to
3918140 its what you learn after you know it all that counts
3918141 my reasons for leaving are justified i felt like i was never taken seriously as a musician with the guys from trouble but i did the best i could in that 28 year effort with the band that is all i would like to say for now however this is not a retirement from the music industry for i have my band retro grave with the full length coming out in a few months with fine players the ep was a solo effort

3918144 its gone very well its pretty stress free compared to past records where wed been in there for months and gone over time and budget martin s skaroupka very aggressive our new drummer and hes only 25 so hes really pushed the album on the aggression side of it hes a real asset to the band right now
3918145 its just basically dani filth vocals and paul allender guitar writing the music the lyrics everything weve all had ideas but 99 percent of it is kind of paul s baby now and in that way hes probably stressed out but there arent five people around him all stressed out were trying to stick to deadline and budge and for the first time in a long time trying to deliver on time its very stressful its about 95 percent done when we get to the studio theres no way were going to pay 600 pounds a day when were still scratching our heads wondering what should come next but to be honest its never finished until its finished things can get changed last minute you can drop a lead guitar part you can add sing over parts its recorded right up until the mastering even though its like skeletons there its still getting flushed out every day were not closed minded you have to be sort of flexible
3918146 it depends what theyre saying you either get angry towards it or you find it funny it depends what kind of mood youre in i guess were not a very good band to go around getting offended when weve got the jesus is a cunt shirt there are laws against that now there are certain things you can definitely not get away with if we went to the merchandise company and said this is the t shirt that were going to sell im not sure if they would just refuse it but it was done years ago when we didnt have anyone telling us what to do i wasnt in the band back then but i remember it coming out and causing a bit of a fuss

3918148 the big thing for most major blackberry enterprise customers is to do their infrastructure upgrades before they do any client rollouts everyone likes the bold but the first place it will go is consumer typically stability and longevity is a bit more important for enterprise customers
3918149 ive been privileged to have three or four 1 on 1 meetings with mike and every time ive met with him the thing he loves to do is whip out of his jacket pocket the circuit board of the latest blackberry hes passionate about how carefully theyve worked on the interoperability of the bold design
3918150 as mike sees it the only real weakness to the bold is the standard usb i would expect that all forthcoming post bold blackberrys to be running microusb
3918151 blackberry has been designed for wireless environments from the ground up which means as you improve device specifications youre still going to have a quick user experience with few delays on the flip side you could say that noc is great but its a single point of failure
3918152 some of it is just general carrier certification issues which is typical for any sort of advanced handset some of it has come from challenges with interoperability testing on 3g networks given the fact that its rims first serious foray into the 3g market

3918159 supermarkets are a neighborhood thing its not only about making money
3918160 they create jobs for people in the community and are there for them at times of need
3918161 one of our issues with the warehouse club stores is also an issue with the mayor
3918162 the city did a study and determined that we need at least 100 supermarkets in the city not more bjs
3918163 i have lived here all my life and i know that many people are on tight budgets they especially the elderly need a supermarket in their neighborhood
3918164 these club stores put everybody out of business when they are no longer profitable they close leaving behind an empty building and a neighborhood in decay
3918165 i would have to close at least one of the stores
3918166 as it is things are already tight with the high cost of electricity and rent

3918189 looks like you had a great time but why were you carrying those two caterpillars around on your forehead the whole time
3918190 the problem is that when two cars double stack in those crossovers the person on the left on the inside cant see the traffic thats coming down the highway
3918191 if a person was to receive some enforcement action it is a civil infraction
3918192 and you could receive up to two points on your drivers license for that
3918193 were gonna monitor it for a year or so maybe two
3918194 and if all of us as a team of traffic people and law enforcement in the area determine we should go ahead and paint the rest of them well do that
3918195 while the secs intentions may have been good their attempt to protect price with rule making was quite flawed and without intended effect
3918196 our belief is that naked short selling was never a problem with these stocks
3918197 we think the sec are going to read into this data that a lot of short sellers exited positions
3918198 but we believe a careful look will show was that naked short selling was not ferreted out but that it was regular legitimate short sellers who were closing their positions

3918219 such theorists are not content simply to advocate teaching about treatment of native americans and blacks from a historical perspective they advocate using the public school classroom as a forum to promote the notion that there must be redress now for injustices that whites perpetrated in some cases centuries ago against people of color a classroom focus upon content based history education is in the minds of the theorists woefully inadequate instead promotion of an activist agenda should be a major pedagogical goal beginning in preschool since most multicultural theorists are educating for justice and activism simply teaching about white racism is inadequate because it fails to demand compensatory action and the renegotiating of power relationships

3918256 im going to step in there and do my job when they call on me theyre working me hard but im enjoying it
3918257 obviously getting him and jeremy newberry give us over 200 starts and guys that know how to play and know how to play a variety of positions
3918258 we felt we got a lot better with those two additions
3918259 im most comfortable outside because thats where ive played the most
3918260 but im ready to do whatever they need me to im glad to be here playing for a winner this is a great locker room and im so happy to be a part of it
3918261 its the time of year where were just being smart with them
3918262 i think neither one will be out much longer were going to make sure when they get back that we dont have reoccurring incidents
3918263 its the same deal theres a mentality if a guys got a bruise and a guys got something he can fight through we have them fight through it a lot of guys have been banged up and fought through it a guy thats got something that could turn into chronic wed rather give them a day off or morning off or rest it right now and not let it linger
3918264 i dont think hes really cut it loose hes practiced well see where hes at if hes ready to go he might play in the game
3918265 thats why i tell people we have 16 or 17 starters on either side of the ball we can put a player like jacques in early in the first quarter to give other guys a break and we really dont see a drop off
3918266 hes got good hands you talk to the kickers its a real art theres a comfort level with the guy and having him thats the great thing about eric hes done it all through college and hes very good at it
3918267 i dont pay attention to it ive been on waivers plenty of times
3918268 i dont know why it is a big deal that ive been put on waivers thats nothing new lots of great players are put on waivers but it is only a story when it is someone like manny ramirez or me someone that people have an opinion about
3918269 i dont think anyone should read too much into this we certainly are not
3918270 i am very happy i feel honoured that i have won the first gold medal in the olympics
3918271 the first thing i had to do was try and stay calm and not yell what are you thinking
3918272 this wasnt about the girl developing hair early it was the mothers obsession with wanting her daughter to be a supermodel
3918273 some kids do have a lot of hair a 10 year old with a dark mustache is going to feel self conscious and is going to ask for waxing
3918274 its not uncommon for girls to get their period and 9 or 10 years old and with that development comes increased hair growth
3918275 the waxing itself is not an issue the bigger issue is whether they are encouraged to engage in risky behaviors
3918276 virgin hair can be waxed so successfully that growth can be permanently stopped in just 2 to 6 sessions save your child a lifetime of waxing and put the money in the bank for her college education instead
3918277 while im doing the childs eyebrows a mother will stand behind me and say look at those blackheads you need to have a facial you need to go on accutane
3918278 i had a mother who brought her daughter in pulled up her shirt and asked us to wax the girls back the hair didnt seem to be bothering the little girl but the mom was embarrassed and wanted it done
3918279 i told the mom to wait until the child wanted it but she refused
3918280 she feels more confident and other kids dont make fun of her anymore she gets compliments on how she looks now
3918281 girls are learning the worst possible lessons about body image and body hair
3918282 keep your bodies like little girls because thats what men like
3918283 let them know that hair is normal despite the images that they see and hear what you daughter has to say this should be a give and take conversation
3918284 i am very happy i feel honoured that i have won the first gold medal in the olympics

3918296 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3918297 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3918298 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3918299 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3918300 i dont know but i sure dont like those who ask that question
3918301 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3918302 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
3918303 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3918304 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
3918305 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3918306 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
3918307 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
3918308 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
3918309 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
3918310 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3918311 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3918312 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
3918313 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
3918314 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
3918315 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3918316 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3918317 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3918318 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3918319 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
3918320 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
3918321 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3918322 the right information has to be given to the people
3918323 yang peiyi missed out on selection to appear at the ceremony because of her external appearance it was for the national interest
3918324 chens original interview was posted on beijing radios web site sunday night by tuesday the link was shut down the chinese government routinely blocks sites that are politically sensitive or that could cause embarrassment to the countrys communist rulers
3918325 judge i have changed immensely since coming to death row
3918326 and realize my punishment is just and i wish to be accountable
3918327 i also realize i owe you a debt i can never fulfill and yet i can indeed offer a form of retribution to at least give you a sense of justice
3918328 ive experienced so many levels of closure that i dont really know what to expect from this
3918329 do you really get final closure do you not i dont know but its something that ive vowed to do from day one
3918330 when a brother goes down like that its such a tragedy
3918331 its been a long time but i still know what he sounds like when he greets me at the door
3918332 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

3918334 she and others were involved in a physical confrontation and altercation which ultimately led to her getting into her vehicle and striking five people killing one
3918335 as far as speed acceleration all of those things are under investigation
3918336 the good news is that the scan showed negative activity that is reacting to the radioactive sugar from your neck down and in the neck region there was a very small reaction so im sure its nothing but we should have it checked
3918337 your throat and neck are gonna hurt for a few days
3918338 by defiantly keeping silent about events in southern ossetia alyaksandr lukashenka stated that he wants to improve relations with the us it is an individual case of betrayal
3918339 taking into account the informational war unleashed by western press international support of actions in south ossetia is very valuable for russia now however moscow didnt received words of support or condolences or humanitarian initiatives from the key ally minsk
3918340 we russia have always shared your distress in international organisations including when economic sanctions are imposed when on initiative of some countries international organisations start to discuss absence of human rights in belarus vocal statements by russia always follow after that
3918341 russia should draw conclusion whether it needs such a cis where everybody kept silent their behaviour was estranged
3918342 the reaction of minsk was unexpected no apologizes no condolences followed post factum on the contrary after listening to the report of foreign minister of the country syarhei martynau about the situation at the main directions of the foreign policy of the country alyaksandr lukashenka called to improve relations with the us and the eu
3918343 this is one of the steps aimed at allowing belarus to actively work with compatriots living abroad
3918344 that ridiculous picture by the spanish basketball team is pretty stupid but not racist
3918345 yes i suppose johannes is black i never really thought of it he was just johannes
3918346 as far as wingnuts go dana is pretty goddamn well grounded
3918347 aw dont be dissin dana for a wingnut hes not half bad
3918348 sh t i like dana more than i like jesurgislac and dana is near pathological in his desire to throw people in jail hes a messed up monkey but i still feel his humanity despite some of the missing parts
3918349 a week without common sense political thought was making me feel lower than a snakes belly in a wagon rut
3918350 dana troglodyte misogynist obsessive a complete loser every time i pick on him no matter how nasty a person he is i feel bad because he is after all a loser
3918351 unfortunately ambassador surikov hadnt asked the foreign ministry of belarus what actions have been undertaken in connection with the conflict in south ossetia and what belarus plans to do in a collegiate partnership manner as it is always done between the foreign ministries of our countries
3918352 if he asked he would know that belarus does not question unacceptability of attacking and use of weapons against the civilians of south ossetia from the point of view of international law and morals as well as legality of russias actions aimed at defense of its citizens at the territory of south ossetia where citizens of the russian federation are a majority
3918353 these issues are self evident for us and for any objective observers it was absolutely clear that the outcome of the operation for restoration of peace would be quick and evident
3918354 belarus has supported desirability of urgent consideration of the situation in south ossetia in the framework of the cis and noted that this discussion could take place in minsk
3918355 the readiness of belarus to review this situation in the framework of the collective security treaty organization in which responsibility zone the conflict takes place is known as well
3918356 belarus advocates a really active role of the csto in crisis situations similar to this and many times initiated steps in this direction in a close cooperation with russia
3918357 in addition if the company is able to identify incremental value or synergies in due diligence it will consider sharing that benefit with the republic stockholders
3918358 waste managements bid is in line with the 36 38 range where we think the company could execute an all cash bid for republic without issuing additional equity and maintain its investment grade debt rating
3918359 what of it if you are saying that everything is transparent and you have nothing to hide what harm an observer could do
3918360 in autumn russian military men will be in belarus then well feel tension
3918361 it is completely incomprehensible for us why the state authorities of belarus are keeping silent timidly
3918362 prove that the state is spying on all those who has oppositional views or potentially could become dissenter as for the policy of the regime
3918363 as a result of that i am fined but i do not count fines it is easier to count the days i have spent under arrest
3918364 independent and unregistered printed media still can be released somehow until the new law on press hasnt come into force but the noose is being tightened and the end is near
3918365 i dont know if were very good but i think well find a lot out in the first half this week
3918366 this is a big physical team that can rush the passer can stop the run and can run the heck out of the ball its the perfect team for us to be playing in my opinion
3918367 the next two games will be a big test for him to see where hes at all the stuff out here hes taken care of now lets see if he can carry it over into the game
3918368 were just going to try to get down to the bottom of it i still cant touch anything i cant put my hand down still very painful my main thing is even if its broken it doesnt mean anything if i can go out there and play then i can go out there and play if something hurts something hurts
3918369 its very evident you can see that so its definitely something that weve got to push through right now if we had more depth wed be able to take a little more time off and let stuff heal but its training camp we dont have many other bodies so weve kind of got to play through everything right now
3918370 one can find other places the most important thing is to get permission for holding a meeting with voters there the official list is a minimum guaranteed to a candidate and it is possible to find moir places and to hold meetings in the streets outside officially given ones one should get a permission in minsk city executive committee

3918373 the international baseball federation has confirmed the test it was done outside the olympic period starting on july 27
3918374 the medications are not illegal but theyre banned for olympics athletes
3918375 im not clear on what happened im not a doctor
3918376 what happened was that during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked as to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with out eyes
3918377 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture however some european media did not see it as such
3918378 i want to express that we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
3918379 when it comes to the olympic games the counters go back to zero
3918380 i dont know what happened after the first set i just lost the match overall it was a good game but i just dont know what happened
3918381 if you treated your neighbours the way we do you wouldnt be facing enemies on your borders
3918382 im playing close to my best level i beat a very tough player today yesterday
3918383 my feeling is go on court and try to play my best tennis all the time
3918384 i couldnt find my rhythm at first i was completely unfamiliar with her
3918385 but finally i got my chance i feel lucky to play on my home court and with so many fans behind me
3918386 i felt a little sick last tuesday night but i was up for the challenge and tried to get the best out of myself
3918387 its something that i dreamed about for a long time its the ultimate goal ive put a lot of effort into the preparation for this race
3918388 it was so great for me to have them pushing me along
3918389 i knew i was behind at the start but i went through a similar thing in the past and knew i could do it if i took every shot calmly
3918390 but the biggest factor in my victory was the support i received from the crowd when i took my shot they went silent and then cheered me if i did well
3918391 to others this might be supreme glory but i took it as just another competition
3918392 this is the most important gold medal the great atmosphere here in china allowed everyone to be filled with enthusiasm and good morale
3918393 i always knew this was the course for me i prepared for it all year
3918394 i did my best its the most beautiful race i have done in my career
3918395 i pictured myself on the top step but whether you win gold silver or bronze its the olympics its important
3918396 it was blown out of proportion and taken out of context
3918397 it is regrettable that the issues had been taken out of context and made into a racial issue
3918398 in fulfilling the aspirations of malays uitm should not merely focus on the issue of quotas but also on improving quality and facilities at the university so it will be respected
3918399 i feel very excited because we sacrificed a lot to win this gold medal and this is a direct competition between chinas team and the usa team and we are very proud that we won
3918400 i dont think anyone will reach that in the next one to two years and when someone does i will create more records
3918401 i am going to golput i believe the number of people who are going to golput is going to be big as their lives have not improved at all
3918402 if voter turnout is less than 50 per cent it will produce a weak government and a weak country
3918403 whoever is elected will suffer from a lack of legitimacy it will be very difficult to implement policies
3918404 bilaterals with foreign governments or agreements with foreign investors will be difficult to conclude
3918405 i believe the local elections are representative of what will happen in next years general elections
3918406 the voter turnout could be as low as 50 per cent or less
3918407 the people will distrust the civilian government and there is no military to fill in as the days of military dominance are over
3918408 indonesia will become a collapsing state and just a step away from anarchy
3918409 in the last few years many people have begun to lose faith in democracy as it has not been able to improve their economic and social lives
3918410 the central government is very weak the political elites in the executive and legislature are fighting among themselves
3918411 if people lose faith in the government they will be tempted to take the law into their own hands
3918412 the radicals will argue that democracy is nothing but the liberalisation of the economy and neo colonisation of indonesia
3918413 so what we need today is to implement syariah form a caliphate and islamic state this is their argument
3918414 i think that is a genuine threat particularly in modern times there are always muslims who believe that democracy is incompatible with islam
3918415 there is nothing wrong with democracy itself but there are problems with the multi party system in indonesia there is no absolute majority at the national level
3918416 the win will help our confidence in the tougher games to follow
3918417 it wont be so easy with australia and the dutch in our group
3918418 i would not be offended if his reasons were backed by proof but they are not his reasons were negative and insulted the malays
3918419 he is a natural born hurdler and a terrifying opponent
3918420 but i still believe i can beat him i am at that level now
3918421 he is pretty much holding a nation on his shoulders
3918422 i cant even fathom 1 3 billion people and they are all watching him
3918423 four yours ago when liu xiang won the olympics in athens i was watching the race from home just after running at the world junior championships
3918424 and i told myself well if i get a chance to run the olympics in beijing im pretty sure this guy will be very very hard to beat i never thought i would be where i am now in just three four years
3918425 whether or not uitm is opened to non bumiputeras is an issue which can be discussed in an open mature manner
3918426 he is lying to the other races he added a caveat saying that the move was dependent on the uitm act this clearly shows he is playing with other peoples sentiments without meaning to do anything
3918427 why wait until now he is making a populist statement to gain the support of the non bumiputeras
3918428 the gap between them and students of other races will be further widened abdul khalid should not make such a statement until a comprehensive study is conducted on the current status of bumiputeras
3918429 we dont want to see such populist statements especially now with the coming pematang pauh by election be more mature as such things will affect the nations stability
3918430 we talked about breaking seven minutes and we had two guys who averaged 1 45 or better they really did it and pulled it out for the team
3918431 my goggles were filling up with water during the race and i had trouble seeing the wall
3918432 he wont appreciate the history of what is happening here until later maybe years later
3918433 at niles we pride ourselves on engineering and building bulletproof reliability into all of our loudspeakers
3918434 when a customer purchases niles loudspeakers they can be absolutely confident that they will exceed their expectations not only when new but for many many years to come
3918435 we have designed the dml series digital media player server to be the ultimate backbone of any entertainment system or digital media library

3918437 16 forever if the first chinese competitor hits the uneven bars and explodes into a plume of fuschia colored dust well know for sure
3918438 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
3918439 we have to be fair the counsels client is not the only one in the dock
3918440 being the only booth with strawberry products we get more than 500 visitors daily
3918441 we have processing factories in cameron highlands we also train students on highland agriculture
3918442 we have an edge in the market because of our unique climate
3918443 things are going well so far ive had good workouts the past few days probably some of my best of the season my legs feel great and i cant wait until monday
3918444 when i run my race i go out hard when i was running down the backstretch i would catch up on the runners and back off a little bit and when i was doing that i was letting lashawn get ahead of me
3918445 i didnt start working until the 250 mark and by then it was too late i corrected that and paris was the one where i finally corrected it the right way and ran the race i should have run
3918446 i tried to work a lot harder than even what i was and correcting what i did wrong in those races
3918447 i started doing it a little bit in rome and in paris i was finally able to do what i wanted to and should have been doing in those two races
3918448 for me its great to have a rivalry it makes me work harder at practice
3918449 i know lashawn will be there working as hard as i am so im thinking i need to work even harder
3918450 i havent actually watched any events going on here yet
3918451 the humidity is bad but the pollution isnt i dont feel it
3918452 the weekly is non partisan to any political party we are about educating the catholics whats the problem with that
3918453 it is not like just anybody could pick it up at news stands
3918454 they should also put a christian to assess materials related to the faith as he would have a better understanding of the religion
3918455 the editorial is only asking people to pray for a just and fair by election how is that going against the permit conditions
3918456 quacking ducks will poop on your beautiful memorial how will you feel about that
3918457 isnt it a little late for you guys to be out
3918458 we are reaping what we as a nation have sown
3918459 one has fear of getting caught walking the streets at night only to get the same as him
3918460 you see a 15 year old white girl with a person you believe to be a gangster or a thug whats wrong with this picture
3918461 most of us keep it to ourselves but youve got 17 year olds out there being rude and dumb they broached the topic
3918462 those kids dont need to be gone in prison for 17 18 years
3918463 some families are even afraid to send their kids to school
3918464 hed walk around in ripped up jeans and an old shirt so they could have nice clothes
3918465 hey guys remember hold the bear close to the lightning they looked at me like i was nuts again
3918466 if you already worry about the way your teenager can swing wildly from one viewpoint to another you probably dont want to hear this
3918467 kids can believe in abstinence but also intend to have sex
3918468 increasing a kids abstinence intentions has little impact on the bottom line
3918469 he may become we think confused or conflicted and those heightened abstinence intentions may make him more likely to have sex in a kind of boomerang effect
3918470 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
3918471 who are not members of our organization dont have seat belts dont have insurance they dont have headlights and tail light
3918472 its uncommon to see people dressed up like this so the victims were watching them
3918473 it was scary because i never experienced anything like that before he chased her little boy with an ax he ran down the street chasing people and i was in there laying down and look he axed my door
3918474 he chased my son back into the yard with the ax i grabbed my son threw my son into the house and i grabbed my gun and told him not to take another step because i was going to shoot him he raised the ax up and dropped it back down and ran down the street
3918475 if he has had a mental problem prior too he should not be living alone without his medications its unsafe for the neighborhood and its definitely unsafe for him if he comes on my property that way again

3918551 if we are really very strong and they umno are in a weak situation why must we feel threatened
3918552 our leaders met their counterparts in umno armed with a mandate and the decision of the syura council
3918553 they did not go to negotiate for ministerial posts but to tell umno leaders to embrace the way of islam to resolve problems besetting malaysians
3918554 is it not the quran that teaches us to hold discussions if an enemy seeks for one to solve problems related to islam we must remain calm and follow developments closely

3918567 steps have also been taken to provide a better habitat for the snakes including carrying out research to determine suitable conditions for them
3918568 routine health checks are being done to ensure the snakes are healthy and we have also engaged experts to look into their diet
3918569 a committee comprising officers of the state forestry department kuala pilah district council state economic planning unit tourism promotion board and tourism action council has been set up to oversee the farm
3918570 the committee will work closely with snake experts from universiti pertanian malaysia to ensure the snakes are well cared for
3918571 we want the farm to be a big tourism attraction for both local and foreign tourists and we will do all we can to ensure the snakes are well cared for

3918576 if pas imposes such conditions dap and pkr will have difficulty keeping our multiracial agenda
3918577 pakatan rakyats agenda is to cater to all races and therefore should always be maintained on a multiracial basis
3918578 in this respect we can ensure there will always be a good muslim representation in parliament
3918579 the statement contrasts with the position adopted by the pakatan rakyat consultative council which is represented by leaders of the three component parties
3918580 only yesterday tuesday we had the selangor pakatan rakyat meeting chaired by the menteri besar tan sri abdul khalid ibrahim and no such issue was raised
3918581 its hypothetical every party is entitled to say whatever they want to say
3918582 the fact is we cant do without these foreign workers the locals dont want to work in coffeeshops and even if they do they dont last very long
3918583 we cant let this go on whats going to happen to them when they grow up

3918657 question 1 question 2 etc when asked a question a debater must give a straight forward answer in his next post explanations and qualifications to an answer are acceptable but must be preceded by a direct answer responses should be made within 24 hours one single 24 hour extension can be used by a member by requesting it in the thread if 24 hours passes without response you may proceed with your next post members who exceed 24 hours run the risk of losing their post but may still post up until their opponent has submitted their next response many thanks to memoryshock for hosting this debate and many many thanks to whatukno for choosing the topic and offering to have this debate with me in what will be my very first official ats debate the debate this debate concerns the discussion between skeptics and believers regarding the divinity of jesus the three most common arguments from skeptics include 1 jesus himself never claimed nor did he imply divine status 2 jesus earliest followers either never claimed jesus was divine or misunderstood his claims regarding his divine status 3 the divinity of christ was later decided by the church centuries after the life of jesus and his followers in this debate i will show beyond reasonable doubt the above is untrue by using internal biblical and external extrabiblical evidence to verify the following 1 jesus did acknowledge his own divinity in several different ways 2 jesus earliest followers believed taught acknowledged that jesus was not only the son of god but that he was also god the son 3 authors during the ante nicene period both christian and pagan thoroughly documented early beliefs that jesus claimed divinity and that he was divine we will be examining the available biblical texts themselves to see exactly what jesus and the authors of the bible claim regarding jesus divinity was jesus merely an anointed prophet and spiritual teacher or did he actually claim to be divine do the frequent titles son of god son of man rabbi or any other new testament title given to jesus or used by jesus negate his divine status what do other authors of the new testament say concerning jesus position finally we will also examine what the ante nicene extrabiblical authors both religious and pagan had to say about jesus divinity and jesus claims of divinity for the duration of this debate i will be using the new international version niv english translation as it is believed by the majority of scholars to be the most accurate in terms of translation and created from some of the oldest and most reliable new testament texts in existence in the case of controversy or if a higher critical analysis is needed i will be resorting to the assistance of greek new testament lexicons and greek english dictionaries for the course of this debate i ask that the judges and readers of this debate put aside all preconceived religious beliefs to examine the facts this debate is not to prove the god of the judeo christian faith and bible is the one true god on a spiritual level or that christianity is the true religion rather it is to examine the evidence and facts available to us to determine whether or not jesus was actually god according to the early christian faith and the bible or if his status was misunderstood or later exalted during church councils one does not need to be a christian to accept the pro position for this debate i will be interested in facts just the facts and facts substantiated by the available evidence is jesus god this is an interesting question and one that has plagued christianity for over two millennia now is the savior christ actually god incarnate i will in this debate try and answer this question what i am not going to do in this debate is try to sway belief belief itself is not fact it may be based on some truth but it is not fact the fact is jesus is the son of god according to the bible and jesus was gods sacrificial lamb to form a new covenant with mankind after of course man had all but destroyed the original covenant with god god had made quite clear what the commandments that thou shall put no other gods before me written in stone by the hand of god given to moses on the mountain these were gods laws however mankind throughout the bible lost track of that covenant god having set forth the rules for the covenant had to reestablish the bond between him and mankind in the ancient hebrew custom a sacrificial lamb was slaughtered for as to pay offering unto god it was the blood sacrifice that was required to pay homage to god and to keep the covenant between god and man jesus christ son of mary and joseph the only begotten son of god gods right hand jesus the spirit that replaced lucifer after his fall jesus the lamb of god the almightys sacrifice to his wayward children was not god is not god and never was god my opponent obviously will use the holy trinity as a basis for her argument however this basis is flawed as i will show that god the father god the son and god the holy spirit is a misstatement a indivisible trinity has been shown by the church and has for millennia been inaccurately touted as meaning the man jesus was god i will also show in this debate how jesus being touted as the son of god is a theft from roman religion incorporated into the new christianity in order to allow romans that were converting to the new religion to more easily be able to accept the idea of a singular god instead of their normal pantheon of gods throughout the ages the bible itself has been bastardized rewritten and edited in order to fulfill the political climate of the age the bible as it stands now is a far cry from the books as they were written even after the new testaments assembly by the early church through the dark ages the original script of the bible has been copied and translated by illiterate often drunk monks working hours at a time to rewrite page after page of a manuscript that was hand written before them upon the invention of gutenbergs moveable type bibles were finally copied and printed in bulk allowing many people access to a standardized version of the book this slowed the damage to the original text however it is likely that the bible as it stands today is still a bastardized and watered down version of its original self most biblical scholars recognize that the new testament was officially recognized by the council of trent in 1546 up until that point the bible was a loose confederation of several gospels and clergy were using whatever gospel that they deemed best suited the flock they were trying to teach this leads back to our main focus for this debate was jesus god while jesus may have been the son of god he was not the god of the old testament nor is he the almighty as he is inaccurately portrayed in modern christianity finally i will show how it may even be possible that jesus was the product of either mary and josephs own procreation or even mary being the victim of a rape also i will show how miracles attributed to jesus may have been lifted from older religions texts i leave my opponent with my socratic questions 1 as depicted in the commercially accepted christian bible was jesus most often and repeatedly known as the son of god 2 was christ also referred to as the lamb of god 3 is god the alpha amp the omega immortal 4 in modern christianity do the ten commandments of god to moses still apply 5 who was witness to christs resurrection my opponent raises some interesting points that he says he will be introducing into the debate and i look forward to reading them his supporting evidence that will be examined and dissected closely by myself and of course refuted with vigor i will now present the first part of my case followed by the answers to whatuknos five socratic questions what the gospels say regarding the divine status of jesus point one jesus accused of blasphemy for claiming divinity
3918658 i showed you many good works from the father for which of them are you stoning me
3918659 we are not stoning you for any of these but for blasphemy because you being a mere man claim to be god
3918660 because you have seen me you have believed blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed
3918661 suppose i go to the israelites and say to them the god of your fathers has sent me to you and they ask me what is his name then what shall i tell them
3918662 write blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the lamb
3918663 do not do it i am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers who hold to the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy
3918664 it is written worship the lord your god and serve him only
3918665 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you and surely i am with you always to the very end of the age
3918666 why does this fellow talk like that hes blaspheming who can forgive sins but god alone

3918681 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones

3918683 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle

3918685 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

3918713 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

3918727 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3918728 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3918729 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3918730 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3918731 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3918732 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3918733 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
3918734 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3918735 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3918736 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3918737 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3918738 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3918739 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3918740 the new york based research firm had predicted almost 26 billion in ad sales this year
3918741 advertising is the canary in the coal mine in a weaker economy hallerman said
3918742 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3918743 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3918744 where russia can threaten a neighbour occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3918745 it will be necessary for the us to chose between supporting this virtual project georgia and real partnership with russia
3918746 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3918747 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3918748 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3918749 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3918750 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3918751 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3918752 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3918753 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3918754 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3918755 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3918756 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3918757 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3918758 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3918759 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3918760 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3918761 the operation of the electoral finance act under an mmp system is likely to lead to much more action in the courts after the election than in previous elections electoral law expert hayden wilson of legal firm kensington swan is predicting
3918762 the result of the election could even turn on the decisions of the electoral court if there were litigation arising out of the results in certain critical seats
3918763 the most obvious example is tauranga if new zealand first gets three or four percent of the party vote nationwide but winston peters doesnt win back tauranga hed have all the incentive in the world to litigate the result
3918764 and if he were to get an election result overturned hed bring back a group of mps which would change the whole make up of parliament and potentially who forms the government
3918765 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3918766 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3918767 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3918768 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3918769 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3918770 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3918771 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3918772 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3918773 i am really 15 but i think i may know which site they are confused about my age from as this admin was thinking he was better then me because i was younger then him so i changed my age and chatted a load of rubbish i didnt know that people were going to take it so seriously he never was in hospital he isnt ill at the moment and he now knows who hacked him and explained i am going to go and do something for a bit
3918774 why does everyone still like him he is a skinny but everyone likes him why we absolutely hate him we hacked his accounts thanks mommy for letting us babysit cruz you dumb bitch so we can get to his computer you all are mental if you like keiran why the fock do you all like him he is from america you stupid people just hate him why does everyone hate us and like him for why is he so special everyone likes him and he doesnt even do anything stupid skinny bint even with him being dead you still like him what the hell does it take for people to hate people thats for not taking us on holiday and we hate you you stupid ing american we hope his holiday gets ruined we hope his plane crashing and he does really die i bet even know people are still going to like him just hate him hate keiran because he is a stupid american who everyone likes we hope he dies for real we all hope you hate him now and we hope he understands what it feels like not to be so popular and liked
3918775 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
3918776 didnt we go through this already a short time ago

3918779 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3918780 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3918781 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3918782 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3918783 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3918784 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3918785 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3918786 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3918787 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3918788 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3918789 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3918790 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3918791 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3918792 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

3918794 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3918795 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3918796 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3918797 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3918798 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3918799 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3918800 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3918801 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3918802 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3918803 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3918804 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3918805 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3918806 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3918807 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3918808 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3918809 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3918810 im working on a commercial real estate site and im having a bit of trouble coming to agreement with my client on categorization he wants a two level category scheme which is fine the problem is he want some terms at both levels of the categories
3918811 dont believe everything you read call your internet real estate leads
3918812 when do we bring you into a project and why
3918813 why do you make a sitemap instead of the technology team
3918814 why do you suddenly get to tell me what to design if im a designer and youre not
3918815 have you ever noticed that mac users tell you what they love about their system but windows users tell you what they hate why is that
3918816 ever purchased a brand new apple mac book or macbook pro etc what was your experience like from opening the packaging looking over the very simple setup getting started page to powering it up and logging in for the first time

3918825 these agents have to be ruthless people with the ability to perform independently they should take orders directly from the commander of ergenekon and they should be unknown to higher level administrators the organizations personnel and its agents

3918827 this was the target of the organization they planned to create a country of anarchy and chaos
3918828 or a yellow alert triangle on the lan icon on the system tray
3918829 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3918830 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3918831 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3918832 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3918833 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
3918834 she loved talking to kids because they would ask more honest questions
3918835 adults would kind of stand back and stare and not know how to approach her
3918836 were going to have to move after were done filming
3918837 you can hear the tour guides like just yesterday we saw lauren conrad pulling into her driveway and she stopped to get the mail
3918838 and lo lauren bosworth was walking down the street one day and they were like here on the left we have a celebrity dog walker walking chloe
3918839 l a is a really young city and its great for now but eventually im going to want to settle down a little bit
3918840 hes got this really cool style and im always bugging him that we should do a guys line together
3918841 it would be more his thing but i would help him with it
3918842 i believe in a private ballot i dont want to ever influence someones vote or have my vote change someones opinion of me
3918843 we appreciate the enthusiasm of our developers and were excited that youre so passionate about the android platform thanks for taking the time to send this
3918844 sounds like a polite way of saying nothing a verbal silence
3918845 every single twitter post you write should be something that could get you laid ruin a marriage or bring a tear to a fat little kids eye
3918846 dont try to impress just be yourself but go a little beyond your comfort zone share something youre hesitant about sharing
3918847 does santa know that all his female elves are masquerading as gymnasts in china i bet hes going to be pissed
3918848 i wanted to show that the olympics are above politics and i wanted to show a sign of peace
3918849 we are not playing the georgian team we are playing against our brazilian friends
3918850 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3918851 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
3918852 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3918853 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3918854 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3918855 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3918856 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3918857 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted
3918858 we expect him to break world records we expect him to win
3918859 i was more or less sort of counting strokes i sort of know how many strokes i take for 50 and i was hoping that i would be dead on
3918860 it was a best time but i was just disappointed
3918861 share how obamas policies have been directly shaped by the people he has met as he traveled the country
3918862 ask congress to grant me the privilege of coming before both houses to take questions and address criticism much the same as the prime minister of great britain appears regularly before the house of commons
3918863 the scanmyphotos com service could turn out to be the best 50 plus shipping and optional services youll ever spend
3918864 the results are well worth it scanmyphotos com ships your original photos back to you by priority mail two or three days complete with a nicely custom labeled dvd
3918865 scanmyphotos probably isnt getting rich by charging only 50 per 1 000 photos clearly the real money is in the optional services some of which are ingenious and nearly irresistible for example for 125 the company will send you a pre addressed shipping box that holds 1 600 photos 4 x 6 the price includes scanning and prepaid shipping both ways if you buy two you get a third box free making the deal when you consider postage even better than the 50 offer
3918866 you can order a hardbound custom printed book containing every single scanned picture the company even rotates the vertical shots upright for you the layout is not fancy the pictures are small and numbered but in my family this book was a huge hit
3918867 mastercard statement on the credit card fair fee act of 2008
3918868 i think its difficult for him to fix it because of the judgments hes made in the past and his lack of experience
3918869 if we are dissatisfied with obama as a potential president hillary cannot be expected to change our minds
3918870 there are other products out there what makes ultraclipboard the best
3918871 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
3918872 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
3918873 stable home prices will clarify the level of equity in homes the ultimate collateral support for much of the financial worlds mortgage backed securities
3918874 we wont really know the market value of the asset side of the banking systems balance sheet and hence banks capital until then
3918875 its hard to escape the conclusion that at some point our extraordinary housing boom cannot continue indefinitely into the future
3918876 this race can be very hot as we saw last year and our data from the thrilling final race of last season showed us that this change would be beneficial for the teams
3918877 participation of india in the decisions regarding proposed amendments will facilitate their implementation by india
3918878 now its north americas turn and we intend to deliver these small cars profitably
3918879 when we look at alliances in different regions we have had discussions with multiple companies in russia
3918880 the challenge especially with small cars is to bring the price down to where more people can afford it
3918881 small efficient vehicles are not short term strategies for honda they are part of a fundamental commitment that goes back to hondas entry into the auto industry in the 1970s
3918882 as banks leave leasing and other manufacturers leave leasing perhaps it creates an opportunity for us
3918883 setting up a sharia financial company has been a great pleasure for us although we have taken a
3918884 the trust we have garnered from our sharia advisers is something that money cant buy as is the trust we are going to engender with our customers
3918885 this is another product offered by london which as you all know is the islamic financial centre of europe
3918886 but i think the last two or three years thats kind of changed now you see teams like nevada which was what top 10 in the nation in rushing in 2007 i played against nevada and i have more respect for their offensive line and their running backs
3918887 its more smash mouth now theres more prolific running backs in the league than there are prolific quarterbacks coming back its definitely changed
3918888 its one of the myths and its been a great marketing tool for the wac the wide open league we have but people dont realize how physical this league is you look at the teams that have won the most consistently the last four or five years theyre physical even hawaii thats not a finesse football team they look finesse but theyre physical
3918889 if the guy is asking for the value of that position you would think you would have to pay him at that position
3918890 but im not in those departments i would just like to have all of our players in camp
3918891 hes slotted i have a hard time understanding what is the problem
3918892 to me basically its how bad a guy wants to be in camp to take the high end of the slot or the low end or meet in the middle
3918893 theres still opportunity for us and theres still time to wake up
3918894 we were looking for a spark to be able to bring the other guys up to a level we expect
3918895 when it became obvious that ryan was having some of the same situations that kevin was facing when he was quarterback we made the decision to go back with kevin glenn
3918896 i think kevin glenn is ready to come back and be the starter hes probably going to be calling 95 per cent of the game
3918897 mistakes are going to be made that happens no matter whos calling the plays so were just going to go out there and whatever glenn calls were going to go run it to the best of our ability
3918898 thatll be something new but at the same time were just going out to play football try and play football and get a win
3918899 its just a new experience as a whole a new opportunity to seize
3918900 i expect it to be a war out here thursday night
3918901 where russia can threaten a neighbour occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3918902 it will be necessary for the us to chose between supporting this virtual project georgia and real partnership with russia

3918911 id like to calm everybody down the russian military is not advancing towards the capital
3918912 no russian peacekeepers or any troops have been sent to gori
3918913 the eu must be ready to engage including on the ground to support all efforts including those of the united nations and the osce for a lasting and peaceful settlement of the conflicts in georgia
3918914 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles
3918915 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3918916 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3918917 intelligent core is not only exclusive term company name brand but rather vision artificial adaptive intelligent self learning individually and universally applicable processing unit
3918918 we are pleased that we have been able to come to agreement with justin he is an accomplished college left handed starting pitcher with a solid upside

3918920 with spore were looking way outside the game space such as tv movies etc
3918921 were basically planting the seeds to spread spore out to a much wider group of people than would ever play a computer game were going to be much more intelligent about harvesting other market opportunities for spore than we were with the sims which as big as it was in the game space pretty much remains in the game space
3918922 so when i came to dallas he already knew how hard i worked
3918923 chris brings a tremendous amount of experience and unprecedented success in positioning and selling the attractive and elusive 18 34 year old male audience
3918924 this demographic target will become more and more important for pandora and chris track record in packaging this opportunity for large national brand advertisers will be instrumental to achieving our ad revenue goals in this area

3918930 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment
3918931 do not lay hands upon anyone too hastily and thereby share responsibility for the sins of others
3918932 theyre great for their intended uses but theyre not for everyone

3918937 the last decade of the twentieth century has witnessed a tectonic shift in world affairs for the first time ever a non eurasian power has emerged not only as a key arbiter of eurasian power relations but also as the worlds paramount power the defeat and collapse of the soviet union was the final step in the rapid ascendance of a western hemisphere power the united states as the sole and indeed the first truly global power but in the meantime it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book
3918938 in that context how america manages eurasia is critical a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania australia geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources
3918939 moreover as america becomes an increasingly multi cultural society it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat
3918940 never before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy but the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the publics sense of domestic well being the economic self denial that is defense spending and the human sacrifice casualties even among professional soldiers required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization
3918941 two basic steps are thus required first to identify the geostrategically dynamic eurasian states that have the power to cause a potentially important shift in the international distribution of power and to decipher the central external goals of their respective political elites and the likely consequences of their seeking to attain them second to formulate specific u s policies to offset co opt and or control the above
3918942 to put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals to keep tributaries pliant and protected and to keep the barbarians from coming together

3918946 bill gwatney is an individual who cares a great deal about arkansas and its future
3918947 it has taken a long time to get here but im happy that my future at chelsea has now been sorted and that i will be staying here for the next five years
3918948 i pride myself on my fitness and on how much effort i put in during training and for those reasons feel this could be the best five years of my career
3918949 i want to win more trophies and certainly feel i can do that here this is a great club with a great squad and where the morale is as high as ive ever experienced after winning nothing last season all the players really have the bit between their teeth this year i think we can not only win things domestically but also in europe
3918950 what the lads did at the united match was very emotional i sat and watched that with my family and it is something none of us will never forget
3918951 i cant speak highly enough of them nor the fans who sent me loads of letters after what happened in my private life they have been fantastic throughout my time here and hopefully i can repay them on the pitch
3918952 all were focusing on at the moment is the fact we will be keeping frank lampard for the next five years
3918953 he is one of the best midfielders in europe and could well turn out to be our best signing of the summer
3918954 the best team does not always win i know that more than anyone
3918955 arsenal were rattled i sensed after 10 minutes that ars ne wenger was rattled and they know that they have been in a game
3918956 we opened them up but the final ingredient was not there you cannot have that many chances against one of the top teams in europe and not take them we got punished
3918957 mcclaren did very well his team gave us a tough game they were great
3918958 but in the second half we took over we had a very young team but we did not lose our nerve or our patience when you look at the numbers we had out we missed nine players it was very positive for us
3918959 if we were to increase the gap by even a second or two this problem would not have arisen
3918960 enough of a success given that it provides us with the data to go operational
3918961 i used do lots of crazy stuff like fly a fighter plane and drive a mclaren f1
3918962 the suppression of black people just didnt seem like a really good way to spend time

3918965 im extremely optimistic about earth and i think its highly likely to be a great place to live for a long time but not completely likely
3918966 100 years ago there was no atomic bomb who knows what the next 100 years will bring some unknown threats that we could invent to bring about self annihilation then theres also the chance of a super volcano or big meteorite

3918981 kan je mij nog even het verschil uitleggen tussen proximale en ultieme verklaringen
3918982 proximate explanations zijn directe verklaringen van gedrag bijvoorbeeld verklaringen vanuit hormonen of vanuit de omgeving ultimate explanations daarentegen geven een antwoord vanuit een dieper verklaringsniveau bijvoorbeeld vanuit seksuele of natuurlijke selectie zo is omdat ze dat plezant vinden een uitstekend proximaal antwoord op de vraag waarom hebben mensen seks de ultieme verklaring is echter dat de evolutie ervoor zorgt dat mensen het leuk vinden om die dingen te doen die als neveneffect hebben dat hun genen worden doorgegeven
3918983 maar je kan het ook los van die ethologie zien een proximaal antwoord op de vraag waarom jij hier nu bent is dat we op dit uur hadden afgesproken maar een ultiemer antwoord is dat je wil slagen voor dit keuzevak je studeert fysica zie ik denk je dat men in de natuurkunde proximale of ultieme verklaringen bestudeerd
3918984 maar hoe moet ik mij daarbij dan de ultieme verklaring voorstellen
3918985 er bestaat nog geen echte verklaring waarom de wetten van newton juist zijn zoals ze zijn en waarom ze niet anders zijn ook voor andere natuurkundige fenomenen bestaat enkel een proximaal antwoord een ultieme verklaring is ofwel voor de verre toekomst of zal nooit gevonden worden

3919047 what you say how you encourage or discourage will greatly impact a child throughout their life

3919050 words can grow into a serpent that can eat you up
3919051 in being known and popular you have stories go around about the artist the romanticism of the artist

3919134 its very satisfying to see the players willingness to stay
3919135 the club will not do anything crazy or break our financial and sporting guidelines so we have gone as far as we have been able to
3919136 there is complete agreement between the club and the player david jimenez silva that he will remain with us for the next five seasons
3919137 we have always expressed the hope that he will stay with us

3919142 putting glenns number up with the other honoured players at rexall place is absolutely deserving
3919143 it is the right thing for our organization to do
3919144 glenn could bring fans out of their seats with his unbelievable goals and they always seemed to be such timely goals
3919145 mideast oil producers increasingly consume their own oil to fuel their fast growing economies driving up oil prices
3919146 showed arctic ice cover had disappeared so much last month that a ship could sail unhindered from europes most northerly outpost to the north pole itself
3919147 the recent push for nations to stake a claim to portions of the arctic sea floor where potential oil reserves are thought to lie has thrown a spotlight on how little is known about these areas and on new attempts to pin the geography down
3919148 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party

3919150 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3919151 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
3919152 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
3919153 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
3919154 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
3919155 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
3919156 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
3919157 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
3919158 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
3919159 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
3919160 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3919161 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
3919162 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
3919163 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
3919164 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
3919165 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
3919166 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
3919167 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
3919168 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
3919169 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
3919170 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
3919171 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
3919172 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
3919173 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
3919174 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
3919175 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist

3919179 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
3919180 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
3919181 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
3919182 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
3919183 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
3919184 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money

3919188 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
3919189 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
3919190 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it

3919205 what will these republican legislators think of next bottle our air and sell it to beijing we need that water for irrigation we need that water for salmon we need that water to drink if this republican plan ever passed the legislature the price for water would skyrocket and the competition for that water would lead to strife and turmoil in every corner of oregon
3919206 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3919207 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
3919208 i think that as long as fair er trade ultimately leads to fair trade then it ia alright but if fair er trade is substituted for fair trade then there is a problem because there is still the element of exploitation in the process

3919210 despite differences in language culture and economic status people around the world are united in their fundamental need to connect discover and interact
3919211 this is a major disappointment at a time when food and fuel prices are high and the global economic outlook is uncertain the worlds poorest people are increasingly vulnerable a decent trade deal could have given them a chance to prevent worsening poverty
3919212 rich countries should have shown the political leadership to deliver trade reform that reduced poverty instead they defended vested interests and put poor countries under intense pressure to make concessions that have no place in a development round
3919213 this is another missed opportunity for trade reform that poor countries badly need and have been long promised it was brought about by rich countries failure to keep their word
3919214 it would be outrageous to blame poor countries for the failure to get a deal if the eu and us had made meaningful offers that lived up to their promises we might have seen progress instead they demanded harsh concessions from developing countries in exchange for largely illusory reforms and limited flexibilities
3919215 ben westlund has the right priorities to help make health care more affordable for oregonians

3919234 ive met with president saakashvili many times including during several trips to georgia
3919235 whatever tensions and hostilities might have existed between georgians and ossetians they in no way justify moscows path of violent aggression russian actions in clear violation of international law have no place in 21st century europe
3919236 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia
3919237 exposing and combating the leftist media has never been such fun
3919238 it is really a cooling off not this big dramatic breakup

3919254 in future the organizers hope to raise more awareness in the local community and perhaps achieve some local corporate sponsorship for the young caymanians who compete in numerous events throughout the calendar year
3919255 officers are doing all they can to identify you and bring you to justice
3919256 this is the latest robbery which has involved offenders carrying weapons of some sort and we are doing all we can to identify these people and bring them to justice
3919257 we are looking at all cases to see if they could be connected and if there is any pattern or similarity its a little early to say for sure if we are looking for the same men or different men in each case
3919258 what we can say is that we need to identify these offenders before someone gets seriously hurt
3919259 businesses should consider reviewing their security measures such as cash handling procedures staff training and the use of cctv and alarms
3919260 all residents should be mindful of their surroundings at all times and report any suspicious activity to police immediately
3919261 about 5 percent of these 18 857 entities in the ugland house were wholly u s owned and 40 to 50 percent had a u s billing address the cayman islands reputation as a stable business friendly environment with a sound legal infrastructure also attracts business this activity is typically legal such as when pension funds and other u s tax exempt entities invest in cayman hedge funds to maximize their return
3919262 it has been fantastic to come back to this team at walkers and to reconnect with the staff
3919263 walkers has a highly regarded finance practice and im delighted to be a part of the team
3919264 we are delighted to have secured davids appointment to bring him back to walkers
3919265 we have always expanded in order to meet the needs of our clients and we believe it is as vital as ever that we continue to have the right professionals in place to service their requirements
3919266 one of the most important things is that we have a constitutional secretariat that is representative of the nongovernmental organisations and the opposition now its just a government body and its not representative
3919267 another thing is that if its just jeffrey jowell in these negotiations then i want to have someone an expert that we can rely on jowell has been doing what the government has said what kurt tibbetts and alden mclaughlin have said we want someone on the inside we want our own version of mr jowell
3919268 as of to date it has been agreed by all that constitutional talks between a cayman delegation and the fco will begin the week beginning september 29 2008
3919269 we would like to have equal access to funding in order to get the publics views and positions on the various issues and have those disseminated we cannot adequately communicate these positions without access to the same level of funding that the ppm government currently has in place for itself
3919270 you cannot blame the secretariat for not informing the public about your recommendations of proposals given that you have made none
3919271 we will be ready by the last week of september
3919272 but we have said that you have got to give people every opportunity to say what they want kurt tibbetts cannot decide for us
3919273 he needs to know that there are things that we are not going to agree the attorney general should be out of the house i would like to see a senate with young people with special expertise elected members need someone to look over our shoulder when we make laws
3919274 we like the idea of district councils that are not elected and are not paid but that empower the people mr tibbetts is not going to get us to agree to everything he wants
3919275 we also need funding to take radio tv and other media advertising
3919276 we need this if we want the process to be fair we have to have it
3919277 my mother adapted to canada quite well and quite fast and we were raised as canadians but my parents also kept up a lot of the typical afghani traditions we ate a lot of normal afghani foods at home and at things like weddings and birthdays we all celebrated in the customary way
3919278 but my mother was very modern and forward looking so my sisters and i were raised to be typical western girls
3919279 all of his family and relatives are still there and so he feels quite comfortable there
3919280 when i first arrived i did a lot of couch surfing staying at friends places as a way to save money
3919281 i think i lived out of a suitcase for at least a month
3919282 beaches are big really big for me and they are so beautiful here
3919283 scared of fish where i lived in canada there was lots of open spaces but there wasnt a lot of water so it will take me time to adjust
3919284 aside from saving money its also fun to just jump on a bus and go
3919285 at first i was surprised that everything closes here on sunday
3919286 but then i really got to like the idea i mean it really does force you to slow down completely relax and just chill out its a kind of healthy way to end the week
3919287 grassroots development through talent identification and development programs instituted in the winter of 2007 2008 helped put together a strong team which has taken canada to this pinnacle and promises to be an indicator of things to come for canadian cricket
3919288 cricket canada has a stated goal to win the under 19 world cup that canada will host in 2012 many players that were part of the winning team today could well be part of that squad programs are being put in place to develop this talent pool to help canada achieve this goal
3919289 i didnt play particularly well in the singles and lost to the better player today
3919290 on this occasion the migrants stormed the doors and as the centre is not a prison there is not a great deal we can do about it although we have beefed up the security at the centre if they really are intent on getting out then they will find a way
3919291 it takes a lot of manpower and places a significant strain on the system but there is nothing else we can do
3919292 we can only hope that the migrants stay within the confines of the centre until they are repatriated and that if they do escape we ask that the community does not assist them
3919293 we see the same people return time and again they know the policy all we can do is to repatriate them as speedily as possible
3919294 predominantly we are concerned with the bill of rights which has the most implications for our country
3919295 we want to make sure that the marriage contract stays between a male and a female
3919296 we are afraid thats a slippery slope argument we see now in the netherlands where the same sex marriage argument is being used in support of multiple partners
3919297 from what i understand pretty much the same positions that we do
3919298 i dont want to say something just off the top of my head right now
3919299 it seems they are willing to come to the cayman islands willing to meet in our homeland it sends a good signal that they are interested and willing to work with us
3919300 i should have been happy with it but i think i could have gone a little faster
3919301 i am just trying to get ready for my other events now like my 100 freestyle that should be a good one
3919302 there was a lot of pressure and expectation on him for this event
3919303 he wanted to do well and he dropped his time but now that it is out of the way he can move on to other events
3919304 i am trying to relax and get a lot of sleep and just trying to keep my mind off swimming and rest up for tomorrow
3919305 hanging out with my brother has really helped because we have similar attitudes
3919306 the atmosphere is just crazy i am really into the games now and everything is exciting i am really looking forward to when i have to swim
3919307 a blog owner who continuously maliciously and contumeliously went on a rampage to defame me
3919308 i have not seen anything more defamatory than what this man has written none of what he said is true
3919309 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3919310 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3919311 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3919312 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3919313 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3919314 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3919315 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3919316 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3919317 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3919318 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
3919319 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3919320 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3919321 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3919322 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3919323 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3919324 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3919325 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them

3919334 the 100m has the potential to be one of the greatest in the history of the race and one of the greatest events of the games
3919335 it has the potential to be one of the best 100 races weve seen at the olympics
3919336 usain bolt has run some incredible times just because of what he has done this year he has to be the favorite
3919337 bolt has done things no one expected asafa powell has always had the potential but he has never been able to get it done we will find out what shape tyson gay is in it has the makings of a great 100 showdown
3919338 i think he shows the potential the way he did it in the 100 was pretty impressive
3919339 he has the ability to go at both and perform very well so why wouldnt you sure he would be the favorite
3919340 powell has proven its very difficult for him to get it done on the day it matters
3919341 hes going to have a tremendous amount of pressure he puts on himself because its going to be devastating to him if he cant get it done again
3919342 the 100 is one of those races where being race sharp is important and he hasnt raced since june and i have to think thats going to affect him
3919343 i think tyson was in the best shape of his life earlier this year building off the world championships he was in another zone he gained a lot of confidence and became more mentally tough
3919344 when its going to be in the low 9 8 or even 9 7 to win it its tough to take a month off but things are different now it will be great to see what he is able to do anything is possible
3919345 he definitely did bounce back he followed two losses with two victories
3919346 he has been here before and has won championships he knows he has to keep his eyes on that
3919347 hes under a tremendous amount of pressure its a huge event in front of your home crowd

3919359 i want to apologize for the disruption and difficulty this issue may have caused to our customers and our partners
3919360 we failed in not disabling the code in the final release of update 2 and not catching it in our quality assurance process
3919361 we have kicked off a comprehensive in depth review of our qa and release processes and will quickly make the needed changes
3919362 i updated one of my five hosts and everything appears to be fine so far
3919363 thanks for all the hard work getting this patch out
3919364 unfortunately i think youve gotten a serious black eye today we were finally getting management happy with the idea of using esx for production servers and this set us back a little bit
3919365 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
3919366 this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with microsofts hyper v vmware ran face first into the very hurdle it was trying to clear
3919367 this will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise
3919368 the esx i 3 5 update 2 power on problem that surfaced today is not related to exploitation of a security issue on esx
3919369 several customers have been worried that their esx systems had been compromised by an attack and that this was the cause for not booting of their esx update 2 virtual machines today
3919370 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama for whatever reason i think he has decided hes going to endorse obama
3919371 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
3919372 the obama people are quietly trying to line up a pretty strong convention
3919373 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
3919374 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
3919375 i have no idea why bill kristol would be making this statement there is no imminent endorsement
3919376 i wanted it to feel like a geek shangri la and in each series ive felt we nearly got there maybe this time with you guys involved well finally nail it
3919377 id delight in tracking down the stuff myself but as i say its just not going to happen this time round

3919413 im in my final year at college and im working too hard to have time for a boyfriend but i love to have fun
3919414 my best friend and occasional punani pals lezzi friends found a newcummers in the library left there by somebody i mean not in the system and we enjoyed looking through it i decided i wanted to pose and she said shed take the photos she came up with the closet thing which is kinda cool i think we had a bottle of wine going while i was posing and we had so much fun
3919415 i didnt start to get turned on or anything till i saw her looking at my pussy and licking her lips then things got all sexual in a hurry and i was doing my best to get her more excited i knew it was working when she started to take her clothes off too after that it was pose a bit then some pussy fingering or nipple sucking then pose some more i dont think i would have been more excited if id been posing for a naked guy and watching his cock grow see dont get me wrong i love guys and cocks and screwing more than lezzie sex but its a bit more complicated to get my toy gets a workout most every night because i need an orgasm or two to de stress me before i go to sleep
3919416 ive never posed naked before or even thought of playing with a vibrator
3919417 average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5 and 10 so a 30 loss is deeply worrying this spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers
3919418 we dont know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality
3919419 30 fewer honeybee colonies could therefore cost the economy some 50m and put at risk the governments crusade for the public to eat five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day
3919420 if the bee disappears from the surface of the earth man would have no more than four years to live no more bees no more pollination no more men
3919421 with the increase of traffic from the overpass project its something that theres no danger at this point but it is something we have to focus on
3919422 it looks weak theres a lot of areas for concern i guess
3919423 we are contemplating versions of one or two of the cei titles youve mentioned on the wii not saying which
3919424 but wed like to see how they do on their initial target systems before doubling down on additional skus
3919425 now the government says theres a need to amend the philippine constitution without appropriate consultations with the people we are not treated as matured citizens because we are never consulted
3919426 our lawmakers have been elected to enact laws and not to alter or change the countrys constitution what kind of representation do we get should our congressmen and senators change our constitution
3919427 may be a way to keep president arroyo in power beyond 2010 because once you begin changing the constitution anything can happen
3919428 not even federalism could solve and we should be more careful in selecting our leaders because federal states will have laws independent of each other
3919429 the best elements of the original are back but have been upgraded to be better than before the new bosses add a more interesting challenge and the final level is one for the ages and of course the visuals are brilliant the remastered soundtrack is fantastic as well from top to bottom bionic commando rearmed is an incredible game thats well worth owning
3919430 bcr is unapologetically old skool from the inability to jump right through to the spiked pits that bounce you back a few feet minus a huge chunk of your health bosses have attack patterns health pick ups have to be earned and each level has been designed around blind leaps of faith and tiny margins of error
3919431 between the multiplayer modes and the challenge rooms theres more than enough innovation to make up for the minor irritations of the retro controls far from perfect bionic commando rearmed is still a much more complete and robust package than either 1942 joint strike or commando 3 and another impressive addition to capcoms download library
3919432 rearmed quickly wears out its welcome and devolves into a series of frustrations precision platforming is required for almost everything and failure often leads to death the latter half of the game is especially unforgiving although ironically the end level bosses arent nearly as bad as the path you took to get to them we recommend bringing a friend along in the excellent new co op mode
3919433 nik ainun who is a dedicated and caring organiser at needles amp crafts she excels at cross stitch and book scraping and a terrific cook the two men in her life will testify to that all this while holding a demanding job

3919435 we guarantee this to the people of the island and to the international and local tourists who will participate and witness the surfing competition and visit during the fiesta celebrations of general luna surigao del norte
3919436 we apologize for what happened we also wish to inform some of the island residents whose cellular phones were confiscated that we will return or pay the unreturned units some of the units can no longer be returned because it got wet and were left when the npa encountered the enemy when they withdrew to claver if you are one of those whose mobile phones were confiscated by the npa please inform us through announcements in the radio stations in surigao city please include the type brand of the cellular phone and your real name we will pay for your lost units
3919437 we call on the enlightened surigaonons to help the npa put an end to the illegal drug trade in the island to secretly provide us with factual data against the drug lords and their protectors revolutionary justice cannot be effected without the peoples support
3919438 land grabbing is a serious crime committed against the people cases will be filed against unrepentant land grabbers or despotic landlords they will be tried in the peoples court and be punished based on the degree of their crime if proven guilty

3919454 he was promised a severance and he should get his severance
3919455 its a slap in the face to the supporters of the university
3919456 it sends the message that its more about money than winning souls
3919457 you tell the critics mr roberts has done nothing wrong
3919458 he has not misspent and lived lavishly off oru money
3919459 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
3919460 i dont want to be remembered as the girl who smashed her face at the olympics i want the world to really know who i am and what i can do take that adversity
3919461 she did that the night after she jammed her ankle
3919462 so shes not going to take her toys and go home she understands shes disappointed and im going to give her time to be disappointed

3919465 they had a great time together but they are just in different places in their lives right now
3919466 he never ends things with a clean slate he likes to dwell on these relationships and sort everything out before saying goodbye for good
3919467 it is really a cooling off not this big dramatic breakup
3919468 whos to say where it will end up but now he has a lot going on
3919469 if she said she wants kids and hes not ready thats not being needy its being honest
3919470 i dont know if i can expect anybody else to point this out
3919471 its dangerous if youre getting advice from people who are very close to countries on one side or another of a conflict
3919472 in an exclusive interview with in touch 28 year old kelli dawson reveals that she and casey 19 were romantically involved and were still sleeping together when jamie lynn now 17 was six months pregnant with his child
3919473 i see him all the time at least once a week
3919474 he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3919475 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day

3919477 the implementation of a new gis is the result of a lamp local authority modernisation programme project that the council undertook with the aim of improving services delivery through the increased use of electronic methods
3919478 this highlighted the need for us to replace our existing gis software the choice of cadcorp sis on the desktop and geognosis as our new web enabled gis was made on the grounds of the softwares ease of use its value for money and the fact that it delivers all the functionality we require both now and in the future
3919479 among the benefits we expect from the new gis are improved working methods the ability for council staff and citizens to access information more readily and to use it more effectively with speedier analysis and return of land charges and other information searches
3919480 we are delighted that babergh district council selected cadcorp sis and geognosis for its new gis and we look forward to working with them to deliver the benefits they are aiming for
3919481 we do export into china but at the moment the volume is quiet small
3919482 one of the good things will be that well be able to go to the local supermarkets and specialty stores and see what the competitions like
3919483 we will be organising a clean up day prior to the arrival of ms dianer but in the meantime it would be wonderful if community members could help in anyway if you see litter put it in the bin that sort of thing
3919484 we think we have a number of strong entries the idea of the overall theme is community input spirit and the town has some fantastic volunteers so i am sure we will do well
3919485 we not only need to know the social impacts of drought but identify any gaps and areas for improvement in government and non government social support services designed to help people cope with drought
3919486 our task is to consider the impact of drought on community development and sustainability looking at how it affects the availability of employment education and training opportunities and of services contributing to health and well being
3919487 theyve done a lot of it in their own time
3919488 quiet a few of them seem to have an interest already in the beef cattle industry and the local shows can only expand on that
3919489 recuperar la presi n en campo rival e intentar obtener la recompensa del gol
3919490 a n tiene defectos detalles que no hacemos del todo bien

3919493 en tercera divisi n lo que dec a llegaba al futbolista aqu no pero es una manera de canalizar la emoci n
3919494 el equipo me lo ha puesto f cil porque aunque era un partido de mucha tensi n yo s lo estoy en el banquillo para corregir alguna cosa y hoy los jugadores me han hecho la vida m s f cil
3919495 de manera merecida despu s de dominar desde el primer momento
3919496 algunos jugadores nunca hab an jugado contra un rival del potencial del barcelona y esta presi n se ha notado
3919497 le propusimos disputar con nosotros el torneo local y la copa sudamericana e ir a cedido al caracas fc para el clausura y la copa libertadores de 2009 esto le iba a permitir un mayor desarrollo al jugador nos iban avisar en 48 horas y en ese per odo se anuncio la vinculaci n con las palmas
3919498 no consideramos justo que luego de formar a un jugador al cual tuvimos ac por m s de dos a os y de que estuvimos pendientes de su desarrollo ahora venga un agente que lo vio luego de estar formado y decida firmar un contrato con l y resulta que tiene m s poder que el equipo profesional y les pasa por encima
3919499 nosotros hemos enviado toda la documentaci n a la fifa el expediente de salom n rond n con todos sus contratos y sus cosas porque ya estamos al tanto que el aragua ni la federaci n enviar n el transfer a espa a

3919502 estamos dentro del mercado y si hay alg n jugador que nos guste lo intentaremos no descarto que se pueda comprar alg n jugador
3919503 nos gusta la gesti n de guardiola y nos gusta lo que hemos visto de samuel estamos todos de acuerdo en que siga con nosotros

3919521 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3919522 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3919523 it would be nice if the person who hit her would turn themselves in because the family is just devastated and it would be nice to have some resolution for them
3919524 weve been receiving a lot of tips from the community weve been following up and checking up on all of them

3919527 we dont always have access to a tv or radio if were out at the beach or something so a siren would be helpful
3919528 peoples taxes are high enough so they probably dont want to put more money out for something like that
3919529 just looking outside you can tell things are happening if it looks like a bad situation turn on the news or log onto the computer

3919572 when a 20 year politician heads into the final stretch of the election with dismal fundraising and debt its the sign of a failing campaign

3919588 when i started in 2001 it was really really dead in here
3919589 keeping it absolutely silent no food no drink that creates what this generation perceives as a hostile environment
3919590 they teach it one way in school and you either get it or you dont
3919591 however good the schools are however good the teachers are its just not possible for them to cater to the needs of each and every child
3919592 with the gas prices going up transportation is something that people are beginning to take into consideration
3919593 she seems to enjoy it immensely i hear her laughing all through the sessions with each teacher

3919595 i think tutorings a good thing for all sorts of reasons
3919596 whether its to give them a good base or for self confidence
3919597 if you want to take your children to mathnasium for an hour to use as a babysitting service its not going to work

3919601 who are co sponsoring the event happen to be people who lean not just a little left but radically left in fact one of them seems to be an obama campaign adviser to catholics
3919602 is meant to increase our efficiency by eliminating calls that dont necessarily require a police response or could be handled in a different way
3919603 the goal is to get to scenes as quickly as we can the goal is to free officers up as much as we can so they can handle calls as expediently as they can so a call is not sitting in the queue
3919604 no breach of the peace and or no criminal intent is present
3919605 were making serious strides in hiring more officers but its still a deficit
3919606 this is another way to make sure theres an active police presence in our communities

3919608 the sales tax holiday has been around since 1999 and the ongoing intent is to give families a break in terms of doing their back to school shopping

3919630 das habe ich aber viel wichtiger ist dass ich mit menschen aus verschiedenen bereichen gesprochen habe mit journalisten mit sportlerinnen und sportlern mit sportpolitikern und mit funktion ren das war sehr aufschlussreich ich habe nicht einen einzigen geh rt der gesagt h tte da gef llt ihm irgendwas nicht es sind perfekte spiele bis jetzt es ist die freundlichkeit die h flichkeit und der stolz zu sp ren bei den chinesen bei den vielen vielen volunteers ist es so dass mein herz richtig aufgeht die 18 19 oder 20 j hrigen studenten zu sehen die lange darauf vorbereitet worden sind das ist wirklich perfekt die er ffnungsveranstaltung war auch gro e klasse ich h re von den sportlern nur gutes es ist ein wunderbares netzwerk das ich f r meine aufgabe sehr gut nutzen kann

3919632 bislang habe ich noch nicht viel gesehen das reizt mich auch im augenblick nicht ganz so toll ich habe aber heute schon ein souvenir f r meine kleine tochter gekauft einen taekwondo anzug die ist n mlich aktive sportlerin
3919633 es ist sensationell man wird nat rlich schon ein bisschen angeschaut wenn man erkannt wird und man wird sofort erkannt auch aufgrund der u eren erscheinung die leute sind unheimlich freundlich und versuchen einen zu beraten obwohl es mit der sprache sehr schwierig ist aber das geschenk f r meine tochter habe ich v llig problemlos bekommen manche dinge sind hier kompliziert wenn man zum beispiel bezahlen will dann wird ein ganzer verwaltungsakt davon gemacht mit zwei durchschl gen jeweils das ist etwas gew hnungsbed rftig w hrend in anderen dingen die chinesen ja perfekt sind das ist noch ein wenig von vorgestern was mich so fasziniert ist die architektur der stadt ich war vor 22 jahren das letzte mal mit werder bremen hier das ist eine v llig andere welt das kann man nicht vergleichen und zwar in fast allen lebensbereichen kann man das so sagen damals war es das reich mao tse tungs heute ist da etwas ganz anderes draus geworden
3919634 children face a one in a million chance of being killed at school
3919635 he came up and started stabbing her immediately without any words or argument
3919636 he did not stop his murderous acts voluntarily but because of the heroic acts of the neighbor
3919637 powell ended the conversation without entertaining any follow up questions as to whether he would be crossing party lines to endorse obama
3919638 i am terribly excited im impressed and i am happy for barack obama
3919639 lets enjoy this moment where a person like barack obama can knock down all these old barriers that people thought existed with respect to the opportunities that are available to african americans my congratulations to him i take joy in what he has been able to achieve
3919640 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3919641 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3919642 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3919643 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3919644 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3919645 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3919646 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3919647 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3919648 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3919649 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3919650 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3919651 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3919652 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3919653 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3919654 i almost walked to the moon and almost everybody waved
3919655 to see how the senses expanded without eyesight and to prove we could trust other people if we have no fear

3919657 he was surprised so many people would take the time to express support
3919658 liverpool is an excellent example of a city regenerating fast with unemployment halved and increasing inward investment
3919659 this is a counsel of despair and ignorance harking back to the tory days of margaret thatcher when norman lamont told people in the north to pack their bags and leave we have made vast improvements since then and policy exchange would do better to recognise success rather than to send people down to the overcrowded south east
3919660 the science centers we profiled make learning fun for young children
3919661 so when kids begin studying the subject in school theyll be enthusiastic about it
3919662 cosi has worked very hard to make a more significant impact on early childhood education and become a more valuable community resource for families
3919663 the fact that cosi was chosen as an early childhood education leader from among the best science centers in the country means our efforts are paying off
3919664 all threatened salmon populations will likely show reductions in viability
3919665 it seems to be a very thoughtful and fair opinion
3919666 these are pesticides that epa has swept under the rug for years
3919667 these are three that stood out as the nastiest of the pesticides that are still in widespread use
3919668 we will be working in epa over the next month or so to find out if we can find a reasonable and prudent alternative
3919669 thats what happens if you hold them in that concentration for four days that never happens in the real world
3919670 it tends to be a pulse and then its gone
3919671 very very very low levels levels that are far far below what have ever been considered cause for concern
3919672 population abundance likely would decline and recovery efforts would be slowed risk of extinction would increase substantially
3919673 this traveling around its gonna be the death of me
3919674 ive had an excellent time so far theres only one thing that i fear ive been up so long on this lucky star it could be all downhill from here
3919675 for me all downhill is really about appreciating the moment
3919676 obviously its intended to be funny but it really is about being able to know when things are good and thats certainly the way i feel
3919677 theres nothing i value more than working with smart and talented people who do what they do because they love to do it because they just cant help it
3919678 in terms of a recording experience it was maybe the most pure fun that ive ever had in the studio
3919679 number one i had complete confidence in the material usually im working on my songs and full of anxiety and angst hoping the material is good enough to stand up to the level of musicianship

3919685 the notion that somehow mccain is going to get in there and be some kind of ideological newt gingrich right winger is a joke theres no way that he would do that

3919689 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
3919690 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
3919691 i dont think we live in a communist country we will do what is commercially appropriate and what is prudent
3919692 i dont know of any legislation that says the reserve bank actually sets interest rates for commercial operations in this country
3919693 im sure the assistant governor knows it wouldnt be prudent for a bank to totally fund itself off the short end of the curve with 90 bill rate instruments
3919694 we will pass on a reduction but at this stage i cant tell you exactly how much
3919695 at this point its hard to give an actual number if its 25 basis points we will endeavour to pass on as much as we can prudently do given our cost of funding
3919696 it will be entirely on the cost of funds at that point in time
3919697 our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics
3919698 the torching of houses in these villages is in some ways a result of the massive russia propaganda machine which constantly repeats claims of genocide and exaggerates the casualties
3919699 by day five of a conflict one expects that there is some kind of list of the dead and injured but here there is no information nothing
3919700 first they called her name up then they did not even put her name up even though the chinese had finished it was totally unusual holding

3919702 its a normal television thing thats typical in international competition
3919703 i called my doctor and said what can i do to make it feel better
3919704 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
3919705 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what georgian president mikheil saakashvili earlier in the day ordered humanitarian supplies to be delivered to tbilisi on u s military aircraft

3919707 a by product of the nuclear power fertilizer and other heavy industries fluoride is more toxic than lead and only marginally less toxic than arsenic

3919709 millions of people in india and china suffer a crippling bone disease called skeletal fluorosis caused by moderate to high levels of fluoride 1
3919710 using the fluoride in the water supplies in their concentration camps to make the prisoners stupid docile and subservient
3919711 what a man believes upon grossly insufficient evidence is an index into his desires desires of which he himself is often unconscious if a man is offered a fact which goes against his instincts he will scrutinize it closely and unless the evidence is overwhelming he will refuse to believe it if on the other hand he is offered something which affords a reason for acting in accordance to his instincts he will accept it even on the slightest evidence the origin of myths is explained in this way

3919715 these cookies are so good and he made them for me i need to jump him right now
3919716 he made me cookies thats such a nice thing to do ill bet he would make a great boyfriend
3919717 making cookies for me was such a friendly thing to do i want to be best friends with him and never date him
3919718 all of my senses are so overwhelmed by the wonderful taste of this cookie that i cannot focus enough to change my opinion of him either positively or negatively
3919719 since when do straight guys make cookies the fact that he made cookies for me means that he is obviously in denial about his bisexuality homosexuality
3919720 the fact that he can make such great cookies means that he must be compensating for the fact that hes horrible in bed i will never sleep with him
3919721 these cookies are really good he must be hiding something from me ill bet that he has some dark secret in his past and that hes a horrible person i will never date him

3919725 that hotel through steves influence brings many important sports meeting and the occasional grand sports event
3919726 it made me wonder what she was doing the rest of the time
3919727 i thought it was a bit over the top rewarding her for something so routine but its part of a whole culture of stickers and smiley faces and celebration assemblies
3919728 children have gone from background to foreground in domestic life with more attention centred on them their upbringing and their small accomplishments
3919729 on visits to the homes of friends with small children one finds their toys strewn everywhere their drawings on the refrigerator television sets turned on to their shows parents seem little more than indentured servants
3919730 i tried ever so gently to tell them no one cared what they felt in essay courses many of these same students turned in papers upon which i wished to but did not write too much love in the home
3919731 at the weekends the kids are saying to us what are
3919732 said appleton who works part time for netmums an online network for mothers
3919733 the cushioning effect of awarding stickers and praise for inconsequential trivia masks what children really need and are looking for guidance consistency self reliance and love
3919734 because she was spelling the words how you said them
3919735 children have to learn im not saying it has to be negative but there has to be a balance when our kids go into the workplace they are in for a shock
3919736 i have got to go to london tomorrow and they havent even given me a map
3919737 here was someone working for a transport company who had spent three years at university who was aggrieved because he hadnt been given a detailed map
3919738 too many kids in london are growing up without boundaries without discipline and without the family structures they need
3919739 we should bring back discipline and the idea of punishment
3919740 positive psychology says count your blessings my kind of psychology says life can be hard and you have to learn to deal with it
3919741 im encouraging kids not to run away from stress but face up to it
3919742 its a way of reassuring ourselves that our children are going to be insulated from pain and adversity
3919743 we tell children they are wonderful now for tying their shoelaces or getting 50 in an exam but really its our way of flattering ourselves that were far more sensitive to children than people were in the past
3919744 youre subtly giving kids the message that they cant cope with life
3919745 i have a son of 12 and when he and his friends were just ninei remember being shocked at them using therapeutic language talking about being stressed out and depressed
3919746 what we need is to have stuff installed what we need are people to make sure its going to work and what we need is for umpires to understand the protocol i dont think we need a gala run up
3919747 its not a rule change what is there to be voted on in his role as chief executive the commissioner has the power of negotiating with the unions for the players and umpires to get it done theres no opposition to it from the owners at least i havent heard of any
3919748 it is on the thursday agenda and we continue to work on it and continue to discuss it
3919749 she and others were involved in a physical confrontation and altercation which ultimately led to her getting into her vehicle and striking five people killing one

3919751 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
3919752 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
3919753 she was saying that somebody was in her office shooting a gun and she didnt know if he had been hit
3919754 she was just screaming so we got her behind the counter and locked the door because we didnt know if someone was following her
3919755 he kept saying he needed to see the chairman and then just went around her and started shooting
3919756 she said he didnt scare me he was puzzling to me for some reason and i was trying to get rid of him
3919757 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3919758 his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
3919759 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
3919760 along with thousands of other arkansans ginger and i are trying to come to terms such a shocking and senseless attack
3919761 kami tidak terkejut dengan performa yang bagus klub liege kami pernah melihat mereka sehingga tahu mereka cukup bagus dan klub yang agresif yang mengejutkan bagi saya adalah cara liverpool bermain
3919762 kami akan lebih baik lagi di leg kedua di anfield dan akan sangat baik kami bermain cukup baik saat laga di pre season mencoba untuk lebih percaya diri dan melakukan passing bola dengan baik namun kami tidak dapat melakukan itu semua
3919763 fair and accurate up to the point of what occurred at the campground
3919764 last days on this earth were filled with experiences no child should ever experience
3919765 i could go to prison for the rest of my life and never know what could have been
3919766 stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that its sovereignty and territorial integrity be respected
3919767 what i expected specifically from america was to secure our airport and to secure our seaports
3919768 the main thing now is that the georgian tbilisi airport will be permanently under control
3919769 if he doesnt understand the situation well have to go further
3919770 he doesnt seem to understand that the russian army is much stronger than the georgian army his tanks remain in their places his air force is dead his navy is also his army is demoralized
3919771 to leave it in such a condition would be unforgivable
3919772 classic world war ii type and baltic type ethnic cleansing
3919773 if the russian government continues to claim that 2 000 people were killed as the result of the conflict its time to provide some evidence its time to provide some data name age gender the circumstances of death
3919774 my guess is that it was presented as this is the best i can get
3919775 russia has pushed this well beyond the bounds of the conflict in south ossetia
3919776 like no other time the georgians need to work together
3919777 ive been on waivers plenty of times i dont know why its a big deal ive been put on waivers my entire career thats nothing new to me manny ramirez the great players in the game have been put on waivers so that dont mean a thing
3919778 only when its me or manny or somebody that people got an opinion about thats when its a big deal
3919779 it just so happened that people because our team hasnt been going the way everybody would like so this is the one opportunity they have to jump on something and say see i told you or here we go again or whatever
3919780 if youre looking for 300 30 home runs and 100 rbis then i look pretty awful right now i aint the only 220 hitter in this game i aint the last one to hit 220 but its never a big deal when a lot of guys that play everyday hit in the same spot everyday and hit 220 and nobody says a thing
3919781 when the organization tells you that youre fine i cant say im not fine i have to be on the same page as the organization thats just the way it goes
3919782 i talked to my trainer and he said basically what im doing is unrealistic
3919783 i could sit down like everybody else but i choose not to do that if they pay me to play ill play
3919784 anybody that has the type of surgery i had and then youre limited in certain areas then one day youre not limited and then two days later youre limited again you dont understand it
3919785 im not a medical guy im not a doctor i might be feeling great the day i tell you i feel great two days later im not
3919786 if im on the field i dont have any excuses i didnt get it done thats all there is to it if im not getting it done i didnt get it done what else can happen to me if i just say i didnt get it done nothing i didnt get it done
3919787 nothing of this has happened before with their concert dates scheduled so close to each other this will definitely be an unforgettable two months for shinhwa fans in korea although there are worries that this tight scheduling might affect the ticket sales but we feel that this will lead to a healthy competition and might attract more people instead
3919788 everyone has seen their capabilities as solo singers not just in korea but in japan and china as well we hope that dongwans concert will be an unforgettable experience for the fans i believe the friendly rivalry between the members will only serve to produce a cooperative and beneficial effect for all of them we hope for everyones support
3919789 i really cant disclose anything now but ill support the olympics with every bit of my cells

3919791 in my worst moments i think that we might be way too late they have been jerked from pillar to post theyve ended up in one concentration camp after another
3919792 as good as david villa is i like to think i am my own player and wont be trying to be liverpools version
3919793 but if fernando and i can become as successful for liverpool as he and villa are for spain then that would be fantastic
3919794 im really happy at liverpool and i want to stay here for as long as the club wants me
3919795 i am really settled here and i like the city the most important thing is i like the club and ive really enjoyed the two seasons ive been here
3919796 the only thing i am missing is some trophies and hopefully that will come in the next year
3919797 ive never had any intentions of leaving this club sometimes things are said in the press but the boss said to me that is not relevant and he wants me here with liverpool

3919807 i think this is an argument the coup leaders are making to justify themselves and what they did but it doesnt conform to reality
3919808 but usualy they require some pre configuration and testing until it works out really smooth what in the end costs more time and by that also money than just executing the according
3919809 i would put chelsea manchester united and liverpool as favorites again to win the premier league but regarding arsenal they also have a great team but im not sure if the group has enough experience and quality to win
3919810 i see nobody else to win the premier league but tottenham surely has the quality to fight for a top four finish
3919811 i cannot really say who the surprise team will be but year after year we always wait for a better newcastle they are a top club they have huge support and they have good players so we wait for more from them
