4630000 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4630001 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4630002 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4630003 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4630004 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4630005 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4630006 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4630007 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4630008 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4630009 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4630010 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4630011 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4630012 its a matter of necessity its the only way we believe we can get an open access network
4630013 the market is convinced telstra is the only operator that can fund build and operate this new network
4630014 however it is dangerous to assume that the bargaining power of the government or third parties is significantly less than that of telstra
4630015 should the pretenders start being forced to put up their money or shut up
4630016 i guess that is part of the story as well
4630017 its just a case of wishful thinking on telstras part
4630018 they have talked themselves into a belief that only they can do it its why they are refusing to engage with the objectives the government has clearly set
4630019 telstra will be using the same contractors we will be using
4630020 access obligations are always a condition of a telecommunications licence
4630021 telstra would be foolish to try to take the nuclear option
4630022 search engines use bounce rate as one element in determining a keywords quality score and quality score impacts how much it will cost to position your ad on the search engine return page
4630023 quick stop that campaign while we figure out how to improve it so it doesnt lose us even more money
4630024 i know people will suggest this is the start of test cricket being squeezed by high profile high income generating twenty20 cricket but it didnt feel that way to us
4630025 its not ideal but we are hoping the bulk of the squad will arrive in perth on december 6 or 7 giving us 10 or 11 days to prepare during which time we hope to play a western australia xi in a two day game
4630026 i know people will suggest this is the start of test cricket being squeezed by high profile high income generating twenty20 cricket but it didnt feel that way to us we were consulted all the way and there was never undue pressure placed on us
4630027 the reality is the champions league will be worth rand 750 million us 95 million to cricket south africa over the next ten years
4630028 we have to look at the big picture because that kind of money will be of huge benefit to all forms of the game and exactly the same applies to cricket australia in fact they were prepared to compromise even further in order to fit the champions league in to the schedule
4630029 i made a mistake today but i cant regret that
4630030 should be happy that they reward mediocrity in the form of silver medals
4630031 excuses excuses pampered little upstart i think the gold got to her head she collapsed with embarrassment id say
4630032 taking home gold and silver is a pretty decent effort for an olympic meet
4630033 most of you should take a long hard look at yourselves and realise how sad pathetic and green with envy you really are
4630034 nothing but winning will make us pround of you and even it sometimes isnt good enough and we will still tear you to shreds
4630035 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well
4630036 children are not allowed to be outside alone ever if i find out or i see them outside you will receive 1 warning then you will be asked to leave
4630037 we hope this settlement sends a clear message that all housing discrimination and especially discrimination targeted to families with children is a serious violation of fair housing laws and comes with very serious consequences
4630038 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4630039 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4630040 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4630041 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4630042 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4630043 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4630044 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4630045 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4630046 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4630047 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4630048 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4630049 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4630050 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4630051 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4630052 who are open to doing something on the production side
4630053 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4630054 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4630055 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4630056 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4630057 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4630058 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4630059 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4630060 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4630061 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4630062 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4630063 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4630064 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4630065 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4630066 as part of the restoration efforts we are recapturing the original design of the roof based on the first available photo of the mansion
4630067 returning the mansard roof to its original design adds to the historical significance of the restoration work and will help ensure the mansion remains a resource for missourians to enjoy for generations to come
4630068 theres a strong sense of community and its one of the last fragments of a counter cultural unselfconscious place
4630069 i like that there are transients coming in every night
4630070 i love the continual stream of people to look at i dont want to live in my own closed off space people just drop by and knock on your door i want to open my door and let the world in and let my kids out

4630075 mrs bolow the woman who lies in bed all day
4630076 and the ghost who threw your platform shoe at me while i was sleeping
4630077 im not sure how my parents feel i imagine the chelsea is not what they had in mind but that its no big deal its not as if were living in a yurt
4630078 i know there are many people who wouldnt dream of bringing up their children in a hotel where a large proportion of the people are checking in for the night
4630079 i know some people like to control the environment that children live in they find comfort in predictability because the city is unexpected enough but if you want to live in a sheltered world where theres a doorman and no rogue element you dont check into a hotel what makes you persist even when it doesnt make economic sense is that people who live here deeply connect with it and dont think about things in a traditional way
4630080 there are grandparents whose grandchildren come and visit them and the teenagers next door who weve known since they were kids are our babysitters there are other families in the building so the boys have friends here they go to the local primary school and take part in the usual round of sleepovers parties and adventures in the hallways we also have eccentrics of every description and everyone tolerates it theres that old fashioned communal attitude here
4630081 the whole place is magic but its not a theme park its authentic an organic village in the middle of the city where the people are friendly and fascinating
4630082 with the surrealism of hippie culture the violence of the manson family killings and the sla symbionese liberation army and patty hearst kidnapping happening in our backyard
4630083 wanted to work for warhols interview magazine and wrote him letters i love that whole world the beat generation allen ginsberg gregory corso i was absorbed by the fabulousness of it
4630084 so it was inevitable that this is where i should live
4630085 actually it was my idea to come to the chelsea
4630086 sally made it happen i had the outsiders sense of possibility
4630087 you know some people leave because of the mice some because of the cockroaches and others because of the people in the elevator
4630088 for us it was sheer practicality we thought our life had to assume a more adult size
4630089 having a garden lots of stairs and rooms to run and hide in they loved the ice cream truck that went down the street
4630090 i thought i was living the life that my parents hoped for
4630091 but when i showed them the house they were disappointed theyre so used to coming to see me in seedy neighbourhoods with two rooms and a bed that pulls out of the wall i know many english people think children need gardens country houses to escape to i dont want that i think theres too much stuff in the world youre not light on your feet and cant go at any moment
4630092 if your wife says to you i dont want to live here any more what are the options
4630093 it surprised me how attached i am to the chelsea
4630094 made a feast for 30 we cooked here and moved upstairs to my friend susans for dinner then we went up to geralds top floor apartment which has a roof garden for drinks
4630095 these days to rent and not buy is a radical act we chose to rent this place instead of buying an apartment elsewhere and we dont have anything to show for it a lot of people find that unacceptable
4630096 how do you place a value on happiness youll never have a conversation about real estate in this hotel and thats because the owner stanley bard has created this extraordinary community that reflects his whimsies and his peculiar rather crazed priorities
4630097 this hotel does not belong to america there are no vacuum cleaners no rules and no shame

4630099 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4630100 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4630101 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4630102 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

4630108 being just at the beginning of my journey in the tourism industry im so excited about the opportunities that this field will constantly keep evolving to offer to both us tourism marketers and the travellers around the world however my perspective related to the global industry is very positive on some aspects and less on others
4630109 my first is related to knowledge and to what id call the big picture i would say that theres a big gap between the resources that come out from universities and the requirements that are needed when involved in any kind of decision that in the future will have to be made what is lacking in my opinion is a clear understanding about some numbers and some changes in world geopolitics by 2020 the number of international travellers is expected to reach 1 6 billion almost twice as last year and the average growth rate of emerging markets over the past decade is 8 some countries have routinely exceeded that level
4630110 as the world tourism organization has reported when taken as a whole these poorer markets have been growing at twice the rate of the oecd countries and that is very significant dropping the market share over the past decade of north america and europe by some 10 with the majority shifting to asia and doubling the african component
4630111 then as a consequence consider the sweeping global issues that are inevitably propelling these poor markets into a new paradigm where the world will have to shoulder its responsibilities to adequately and sustainably finance and deliver on the development promises and where tourism can and must play an increasingly pivotal role
4630112 personally i dont think there a real understanding of this massive changes and of course potential opportunities among the different tourism actors on the supply side as well as in an academic environment
4630113 on the other side i would add that the way the industry is dealing with climate and environment as well as technology is on the right path many tourism stakeholders with a sense of responsibility are putting climate into the core sustainability mix and the technology contribution to this achievement is absolutely relevant also the technology contributes at easing internal processes and increasing the returns companies as well as enhancing the travel experience and help the traveller in the decision process
4630114 and as the global mobility increases technology will more and more play a central role in assessing most of the previously mentioned issues neo graduates with their highly tech savvy mindset could have a great impact in the future if theyll learn how to strategically use them and most of all having sustainability as main goal
4630115 most of the students belonging to my generation are nowadays deeply tech savvy and their approach to exploring and engaging with new technologies and taking risks is remarkably high they are the people that actively participate in communities plan their travel experiences totally online run blogs and post reviews and finally that are much more likely to bring mobile devices into work and connect them to work systems and resources they are also much more likely to install and use unsupported applications on company systems and they are more comfortable using social networks and web based collaboration systems
4630116 their potential then is extremely valuable for the travel industry especially if funnelled at changing the way companies are managed for example by embracing collaboration and group communication and internal processes are dealt with so in my opinion the most effective way for engaging this new generation is giving up some control on the previously established models by embracing them and their ideas their dynamism and self confidence
4630117 there needs to be more business people involved in the tourism education process the world is evolving so fast and the academic sector is so slow the only way to fill this gap is by providing real experience from real people even if that is just in the form of case studies and workshops without this input you miss the evolution in managing a destination or the evolving of customer behaviour it is real people on the ground who can add the insight into how things are shifting and what the future we will be working in might be like
4630118 si quieres evitar una agresi n sexual no uses ropa provocativa cuida tus miradas y tus gestos no te quedes sola con un hombre aunque sea conocido no permitas familiaridades de tus amigos o parientes no admitas pl ticas o chistes picantes busca ayuda cuando sospeches una mala intenci n
4630119 qu mal que en pleno siglo xxi haya este tipo de situaciones y que nosotras las mujeres quedemos como culpables de esta situaci n yo no uso minifalda pero me pongo lo que me gusta porque para eso trabajo no permito que nadie me falte el respeto y menos que se quieran pasar de listos creo que es una justificaci n machista y antigua
4630120 siento que una es libre de vestirse como quiera creo que en m xico no es com n ver a personas con minifaldas y escotes como en estados unidos por ejemplo que andan como si nada s se incita a los hombres pero no significa que te digan c mo te vistas pues a ellos no les dicen no uses tal o cual prenda es morbo lo que hay en los hombres te dicen groser as o te manosean no es justo precisamente yo traigo pantal n ajustado y en el metro me dijeron un buen de cosas
4630121 por eso nuestra sociedad est tan limitada somos libres de pensamiento y libres de actuar vestirnos y andar con quien nos plazca se me hace anticuado fuera de moda me siento agredida discriminada porque por eso hay personas mal de la cabeza que aunque traiga un cuello de tortuga si hay un depravado me har algo hay que empezar desde casa con buenos principios a los hijos educaci n en lugar de ir hacia delante vamos hacia atr s
4630122 yo creo que es un poco absurdo porque en m xico se proclama la libertad de expresi n y de vestir como t quieras pues depende del prejuicio de quien la est usando
4630123 estamos en una era donde existe el libre albedr o es absurdo que quieran promover eso pero tiene que ver el prejuicio de la chava si se da a respetar o no si lo hace no debe de haber acoso si yo veo una chava a n cuando es raro digo se ve guapa y depende mucho la educaci n que tenga uno por parte de su familia
4630124 es educaci n y es un tema con muchas vertientes el hecho de que una ni a traiga una minifalda pues debe ser normal la ves por gusto pero ah queda hay quien se dirige con otras intenciones y ellas se las ponen porque quieren que las veamos
4630125 a m me encantan las mujeres y si las veo en minifalda me prendo pero yo las respeto jam s ir a a acosarlas pero muchas de ellas s se visten as porque les gusta que las vean y a muchas les gusta que les chiflen me ha tocado ver que una chava camina le chiflan y hasta m s se mueve pero el respeto es b sico y qu anticuados
4630126 because i love you it is best we not talk about this right now lets talk later
4630127 we ask the media for time and privacy as we seek to deal with this tragedy which is beyond our understanding

4630130 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4630131 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4630132 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4630133 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4630134 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4630135 the most amazing feature of chinese is describing the same thing in many different ways
4630136 conventional wisdom holds that major websites should change daily but obama flouts this conventional wisdom by hitting every user 1 once with a signup splash page and 2 with a constant ask for money as the prime feature on the homepage even if there are more current or important stories to tell this is neither good nor bad but suggestive of the fact that the obama homepage is compulsively metrics driven the campaign would not use this graphic if it did not produce more money than the alternative even if the alternative was newer and made more sense intuitively
4630137 in my experience republican campaigns tend to be hungrier because they arent as wedded to the email cash cow most of the campaigns i see experimenting with user generated policy with next generation campaign websites with twitter or with money bombs are republican

4630143 leaving a world of low inflation moving to an era of constraints
4630144 the consumer is being squeezed by rising prices and falling levels of disposal incomes as a consequence out of home expenditure will fall in the short term rural scotland will feel the pinch rather than glasgow edinburgh aberdeen leisure spending will fall but business tourism in cities will remain robust in the short term the middle classes are the market that is going to be effected the most

4630146 only 4 of accommodation providers in scotland operate a dynamic on line reservation system like easyjet
4630147 please make a reservation and we will contact you the next day
4630148 overall this means that business needs to know the price elasticity of consumers using a process of segmentation some consumers will continue to pay a premium

4630162 so many things are unknown with the way food is produced that it feels really good to keep control of it
4630163 it fits with what weve seen historically from the 1970s and even before then when people tighten their belts they focus a little bit less on convenience items and convenience foods and focus a little bit more on staying home and making their own whether youre talking about food or fun
4630164 the straw that broke the camels back was the economy
4630165 but the underlying reason is healthier food were tired of food that has tons of sodium preservatives and all the nasty stuff they put in food that you dont have to be eating

4630302 i told him that we had an offer of 32million from chelsea and that robinho wanted to leave the club he said he didnt want to hear that a player was unhappy with the team but at the end nothing much was going to happen
4630303 calderon said that he wouldnt sell robinho even for 100million he was very emphatic i left the meeting thinking that was that but then i spoke to other directors of the club and saw that this position could end up changing
4630304 i told calderon that they are doing the same to robinho as sepp blatter said united were doing to cristiano ronaldo that is to say slavery they dont want to release the striker the same as united did with the portugal player
4630305 if they do not release him robinho will continue sad and in the year that comes he could leave for a sum that is much less than chelseas current offer
4630306 if he stays next year he would be able to leave for a lot smaller fee than the 32million now on offer from chelsea

4630316 funded 90 percent by the state and 10 percent by private businesses and foundations show how public private partnerships as well as a willingness by local governments to work with less established telecommunications providers can drive increased access to high speed internet service and spur economic development
4630317 its first step was to persuade about 80 broadband providers to share information about broadband penetration connectkentucky created interactive maps that showed broadband coverage along with population density allowing providers to spot gaps in service in areas where there was likely demand that helped providers identify areas where it made economic sense to expand
4630318 organized committees of volunteers from local governments schools and businesses in each of the states 120 counties to identify what benefits broadband service would bring to the community and to explain those benefits to the public regional coordinators for connectkentucky helped local governments establish their own web sites and draft requests for proposals from broadband providers
4630319 based on a formula developed at the brookings institution to measure the economic benefits of broadband service connectkentucky estimates its efforts have resulted in about 63 000 new or retained jobs in particular the groups analysis of federal bureau of labor statistics data shows that kentucky experienced a 3 1 percent increase in information technology jobs over the two years ending in december 2006 compared with growth of 0 1 percent nationally

4630403 there are two different court systems in play and there is no double jeopardy when it comes to state and military charges
4630404 it will be up to the military to determine if theyll charge him and theyll handle this in their courts but he will definitely be held accountable in the state courts
4630405 while the offending did not occur at the school this matter only came to light because of the checks and balances within our system
4630406 leave me alone dont get me mixed up with those guys
4630407 in january july 2008 340 cases of israelis both right and left wing disturbing the peace were opened compared to 313 cases in the parallel period last year
4630408 this was a meeting one of many held by the precinct with other entities with which police are in routine contact such as the idf so we have no intention of commenting on things said in internal discussions
4630409 the idf performs its role in cooperation with the police and shin bet
4630410 irregularities uncovered in police or soldier performance are handled appropriately
4630411 the israeli knesset should learn a lesson from the collapse of the weimar republic i would remind you that democracy in germany collapsed because it allowed the german right to exploit it
4630412 there are days when democracy needs to forgive and leave the past behind the disengagement was a national trauma and it cannot be compared to any other social crisis
4630413 the clemency law will assist in mending the rift within israeli society and correcting the injustice done to families of the evacuees those who paid the price of democracy in the harshest manner
4630414 i want to tell you and you better internalize it even if its unpleasant the state of israels problem is that for years it has been turning a blind eye to the crimes of the right for years
4630415 so the role of democracy and the role of knesset members is to protect and our role the israeli knesset is to learn the lessons of the weimer republics collapse
4630416 i remind you that democracy in germany collapsed because it enabled its enemies on the radical right to exploit it to exploit the democratic mechanisms and it undermined its basic powers
4630417 you have gone crazy you crossed all the red lines it is unthinkable that an israeli knesset member will stand at the knesset podium and say that the right in israel conducts itself like the weimer parliament that brought hitler to power
4630418 as a doctor im telling you sickening self hatred is a serious mental disorder the self hatred of the israeli left is sick and reflects a deeply rooted mental disorder it has no cure
4630419 it would be good for knesset members to learn history i did not compare israel to nazi germany i warned about the way knesset members try to annul indictments thereby exploiting the democratic mechanisms
4630420 there will be a heavy price for this from now on
4630421 this year youll see an even bigger difference because of the economy
4630422 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4630423 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4630424 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4630425 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4630426 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now
4630427 we would expect that a lot of people in the houston metro area who might have traveled further will take advantage of having great beaches and shopping on galveston island
4630428 the problem was the cheney crowd was in too much of a hurry really bush never resisted them quite strongly enough
4630429 shes produced some of the most successful films in the world
4630430 her understanding of how big budget british films get financed out of hollywood is extensive and unique

4630432 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi

4630439 las fuerzas armadas son los garantes de la democracia concepto que incluye el precepto constitucional de garantizar la estabilidad del gobierno legalmente constituido sea el actual o cualquier otro que recoja la voluntad del pueblo que es el gran soberano
4630440 los resultados del proceso cualquiera que estos fueran con la mayor cordura y sentido de responsabilidad
4630441 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo
4630442 hice abundante cosecha de esqueletos y craneos en los cementerios de los indigenas sometidos que vivian en las inmediaciones del azul y en blanca grande
4630443 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
4630444 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
4630445 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
4630446 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
4630447 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e

4630450 adam thought it would be really funny to get paris to respond to the john mccain ad that featured her
4630451 adam contacted paris directly and she agreed to do it he wrote the sketch and she really really loved it
4630452 im looking for something new and exciting to do i want to do something dark or a comedy theres tons of icons that i would love to work with on something new and exciting
4630453 i believe it is possible that there are a few women out there who do freely choose to enter the industry are fully aware of whats involved and or make a lot of money
4630454 never will i stop being on the side of the overwhelming majority of prostituted women who never got the chance to get a better life and are suffering unbearable pain and injury on a daily basis
4630455 we are not in favor of any amnesty for musharraf
4630456 we want him to face charges on issues ranging from trampling over democracy to the way he ruled pakistan
4630457 i care about all of them they are some of our best
4630458 if theres no room for feelings personal feelings then whats the point una
4630459 they take your mind off the things that need to be done
4630460 if they make us feel like that then well never win
4630461 i wish i was we two fought through and just managed to survive
4630462 get roque to my carriage he looks in a bad way
4630463 yes i think we got to him just in time lift his head please
4630464 hes brave any man or woman would be proud to call him comrade
4630465 you saved his life why who are you whats your name what do you want
4630466 youve got a lot of questions you must be una uevera
4630467 he told me the way in those few moments when he could speak is he going to recover
4630468 hes a man of will my name is marx what i want is to join you
4630469 i saw them fight i couldnt stand by done too much of that of late those men and women of yours didnt stand a chance they were butchered
4630470 no they wont but others will come to fill their places
4630471 i used to be hams bodyguard i told someone i thought i could trust that he was a fat pig who cared for nothing except his excesses i was betrayed
4630472 they thought it would weaken me but they were wrong
4630473 well at least they havent brought back the death penalty
4630474 philosophers only interpret the world the purpose however is to change it
4630475 ham had a good library used to be called the british library i think i read a lot found marx liked what he wrote and decided that id use his name
4630476 look this is a crisis weve just lost fifty sods roques wounded and you two are droning on about bloody names
4630477 what i need to know is how to run a guerrilla war
4630478 strike often and fast hit targets that will frighten and weaken the enemy but most of all get the oppressed on our side
4630479 we need weapons and we need to find an advantage theres more of them than us
4630480 theres the legits theres more of them than anyone else
4630481 thats always been true but they need to be persuaded
4630482 listen im done for i need some sleep to think to remember where do i go
4630483 ah thats better you can go in now sorry for the delay next
4630484 come on man we aint winning lets get out of here
4630485 we seem to live right on the edge these days
4630486 an open society in the big tent following the third way
4630487 theyll stink in fact they stink already its much warmer today
4630488 theyve nowhere else to shop have they no leave them where they are to rot
4630489 fuck the electorate im going to put a stop to this
4630490 they want a war well they can bloody have a war theyre a threat to democracy with their weapons of mass destruction
4630491 i see well i guess you know what youre doing youre the politician
4630492 correct i need to get back to the house there are things that need to be said wheres my chair
4630493 i need to put all the pieces in place yes a secret war for now
4630494 some old geezer left it the chair he was pissed as a rat
4630495 she slowly read they stopped talking as they heard tapping at the wired windowpane
4630496 i dont know how he does it im too bloody knackered to get it up these days
4630497 just dont make too much noise or well all be in it
4630498 its the last cat left alive in england they ate them all after the big war not enough meat
4630499 i agree but for some people the prospect of life without meat was impossible
4630500 thats why i come here citizen una asked me to give you a message
4630501 its hard to follow it was written so long ago but they could be writing about us
4630502 the first sentence says it all the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles
4630503 thats a bit different to what they used to teach in my school before they took me off
4630504 consensual civil society but i dont reckon being a legit is very consensual
4630505 id better get to bed got a big day tomorrow
4630506 anvil my wise friend dont be offended but i must go i need to rest good night
4630507 i havent heard that in a long while but whats up with him
4630508 my grandmother used to say it it just came into my head
4630509 yes its fascinating but i find some of it hard to apply
4630510 the most important thing to remember that marx ever wrote goes something like this the philosophers have only interpreted the world the problem however is to change it
4630511 thats obvious una the question is how the hell are we going to do it
4630512 travers go and see whats happened they must be changing shifts in the treadmill
4630513 and as for you cartage get a grip take your floosie upstairs if you wish
4630514 cant you get him out were trying to have a party upstairs
4630515 dont be daft man just rotate the wheel backwards and hell fall free
4630516 these wheels only go forwards sir no reversing no going back its a principle of your government
4630517 i am happy here and i get to play with other children now i miss my mum but i dont want to see my dad
4630518 alison tyler is an author to rely on for steamy sexy page turners try her
4630519 the easy decision would have been to retreat under covering fire the team did not take the easy way out
4630520 this is a perfect example of a situation that could have gone horribly wrong but did not because of the professionalism with which it was handled
4630521 i select the best players and mark is one of them
4630522 sure he knows that too at bayern they work with that as well he will need to control himself the fact that he is my son in law doesnt bother me people will come up with stories i dont care i knew that when i started this job
4630523 i think with van persie afellay van der vaart and sneijder we have many creative and explosive players but clarence is on the radar if i get in trouble with the players i selected in terms of form or suspensions and injuries i know i can call on clarence ive seen him play many times in the last years as analyst for sport 1 and i highly enjoyed his performances but i respect him too much to select him now and then bench him i know how to reach clarence when i need him
4630524 we have a score to settle and any first match for any new team manager is a biggie but im not too happy with the planning most players are still in the warm up while the russians are in the middle of their competition but our first real game is in september against macedonia so we need to get ready
4630525 normally i am working from july 1 onwards every day on the pitch this time around i needed to think hard what to do and where to start
4630526 i watched a lot of games and session i havent seen boulahrouz play thats the only one i missed hes injured and well need to see if he makes it for russia engelaar is a bit under the weather with his knee
4630527 i wanted to give out a message with this group i selected only 19 players a small fixed team i want to create more consistency like this its tough for any club trainer to gel a team together let alone as team manager i wont select players who play one or two great games i need to see more i want to create a core of players who belong in oranje and i will only experiment when forced to
4630528 at the ec2008 weve seen how most goals came from turn around situations if a team has the right positioning its very hard to create something our team has demonstrated it can play sensational football but still our best man was edwin van der sar that tells you a lot we need to focus on our defensive organisation when we lose possession
4630529 tarde o temprano ser n sancionadas con todo el rigor de la ley
4630530 le puedo garantizar que tarde o temprano m s pronto que m s tarde aquellas personas que han hecho actos indebidos sin autorizaci n del congreso nacional que est n utilizando al pueblo para emprender campa a consultas sondeos de opini n con fondos p blicos tendr n que rendir cuentas ante el congreso ante la ley ante los bolivianos

4630536 yo creo que busca eludir la investigaci n que la desfavorece porque todos deben cooperar a la justicia

4630538 convoca a elecciones en el departamento de santa cruz para asamble stas legislativos departamentales subgobernadores y corregidores para el d a 25 de enero del 2009
4630539 depender del ministerio p blico que haga la tipificaci n correspondiente de hecho esa convocatoria es ilegal
4630540 lamentablemente hemos sido testigos de que ese di logo no ha prosperado existe un rechazo por parte de los prefectos mientras el gobierno a n insiste en llevar adelante el mismo
4630541 ya sabemos que hay un plan para la siguiente semana y que es violentar la ciudad de santa cruz por estos sectores derrotados por la democracia perdidos en sus intenciones de obtener el voto popular ahora acuden a acciones de violencia
4630542 ustedes saben que las personas con discapacidad a las que les tenemos un profundo respeto ya tienen aprobado en grande en el congreso una ley que habilita 30 millones de bolivianos para uso anual

4630553 a decline in lodging demand greater than that experienced during the turmoil following the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001

4630555 if the olympics are mcdonalds then womens gymnastics is without question the big mac there is the remarkable cgi like athleticism by all the young women involved then there is the knowledge that the competitors have had their bodies and health manipulated and warped so they can execute on the springboard
4630556 bellow ing about how the chinese team violated age violations and cheated their way to the gold
4630557 if you think our girls are little because of looks then maybe you should think the europeans and americans are strong because of doping
4630558 lets forget the terrible irony that the media is all too concerned about chinese gymnasts who arent 16 but have turned a blind eye to the way chinese child labor has been used to prepare beijing for the olympic games

4630566 la crisis pol tica siempre ha estado entrelazada con la econ mica si no se llega a un acuerdo inmediato s lo nos queda rezar
4630567 lo que ha empeorado la situaci n para los ciudadanos comunes es que ignoran qu se est discutiendo pues los negociadores se impusieron la prohibici n de hablar con la prensa pero tienen derecho a saber ya que est n hablando sobre sus vidas
4630568 nadie quiere quedarse todos han perdido su fe en las negociaciones
4630569 bottling lines are vitally important to each year pearmund cellars staff and volunteers operate a mobile bottling line to fill and label over 6000 cases of wine to learn about bottling visit the winery the first mobile high tech mobile lines

4630572 our checks indicate that demand for the iphone remains very robust and we continue to expect that iphone sales will ramp with improved availability throughout the quarter note that we have seen a major improvement in iphone availability in the us starting 7 28 but we still do not expect supply to completely meet demand until september especially in light of the increased distribution both in the us through best buy and abroad
4630573 we estimate at least 8 3 million iphones could be sold in fiscal 1q09 december with 24 2 million sold in fy09 both estimates look very conservative note that apple expects to be selling the 3g iphone in over 70 countries by the end of calendar 2008 note that upside to iphone sales should boost apples free cash flow we believe shares are very undervalued on this metric
4630574 it does not appear that apple is overly concerned at this time we dont believe this is a material problem at this point and still believe that demand is extremely strong with expanding distribution worldwide
4630575 you are not an accident even before the universe was created god had you in mind and he planned you for his purposes these purposes will extend far beyond the few years you will spend on earth you were made to last forever

4630583 i think people thought i took it lighter than i really did
4630584 for me it was really tough because im a private person and for something like that to happen its so mean
4630585 horrible it sucked but thankfully its over and its in the past
4630586 my fans were amazing because they have stood by my side they really are my core group
4630587 my familys always there for me i just surround myself with good people and try to think of good things
4630588 i was just open with her and she was just so cute
4630589 she was like well everyone can be naked if they want to my parents are very supportive of me and they know im a teenager and yes kids do stupid things sometimes
4630590 everyone knows everything and they can find out everything about you you have to be aware of the people youre around
4630591 im not making jokes because people die from this stuff
4630592 so honestly i think its a bit tacky that you made a joke ive got to be honest
4630593 there are so many lies out there regarding my recent trip to cirque lodge
4630594 but i dont care what people think i just dont care so i will neither confirm nor deny
4630595 im not a spokesperson for any kind of substance abuse organization
4630596 im proud of people who have the determination and the fearlessness to actually go and face their demons and get better
4630597 i mean were all just mixing together that much more we are the future in that sense i dont mean latinos i just mean ethnic diversity
4630598 being a woman in hollywood is a big enough challenge
4630599 what makes it frustrating is when a director or a studio head doesnt see me for the same part that theyll see lets say drew barrymore for
4630600 but its like no we want more of an american type of girl and its like american has opened up im an american girl born and raised
4630601 we have so many asian girls in this country and theyre so not represented up on the screen
4630602 she now does not know when she will get them next for an overnight she complains it could be next week or it could be three months
4630603 if the existing arrangement was acceptable to both parties we wouldnt have to go to trial but that didnt happen
4630604 everyone has personal stuff but a true professional doesnt bring it into the studio
4630605 anything could make me incredibly angry or break down crying thats not something im used to
4630606 it had to do with breastfeeding which is the only thing im paranoid about more than giving birth
4630607 its a lot of stress to buy a house have a baby and get married in six months
4630608 its a lot of life changing decisions im really really secure and happy in my relationship
4630609 now where did i put it all the labels have come off it must be here somewhere
4630610 what was that funny word you said you once was umpiresologist
4630611 no i didnt not in these it was a strange time so many chances to do good so many decisions that were bad wrong or downright dangerous human beings are precious lump

4630631 eminescu a ajuns s reprezinte o sinteza si devine cea mai nalta ntruchipare a inteligentei rom nesti
4630632 dar o adevarata literatura trainica care s ne placa noua si s fie originala si pentru altii nu se poate ntemeia dec t pe graiul viu al poporului nostru propriu pe traditiile obiceiurile si istoria lui pe geniul lui
4630633 ik logeer aan de gang waar het gebeurde in de mooiste hoekkamer tussen de warme eiken wanden van het oude hotel de sneeuw komt met bakken uit de hemel de vlokken vallen in het zwarte water op de bomen en de gazons op de zwemsteiger waar ooit de jongens van r hm in het water doken sliepen ze hier in deze kamer kwam hitler hier letterlijk schuimbekkend binnenstormen de echte historische sensatie blijft uit het doet me weinig zestig jaar lang hebben hier de ijverigste werksters gepoetst en poetsen verdrijft het kwaad sneeuw overdekt alles stilte en zwijgen doen de rest

4630637 ho ho ho time doesnt really fly until you turn thirty
4630638 well thats nice of course youre going to find closure as things end thats how these things work
4630639 i really serve no purpose at my middle school i just show up and repeat things in class
4630640 but i really like elementary school thats where i get to teach and interact with the kids
4630641 yeah i go to elementary school late and sometimes i actually miss the classes i am supposed to teach i think it annoys the teachers there woops
4630642 i thought everyone spoke in loud voices which was good
4630643 i thought kato and ken had big smiles and seemed very happy
4630644 de grootheid van een mens wordt niet afgemeten aan hoe hij zich opstelt op ogenblikken waarop alles gemakkelijk en aangenaam verloopt maar aan zijn houding in tijden van beproeving en tegenslag
4630645 all music all blogs thanks allmusic all blogs hiya great blog your stuff is top class man i have added you to my extensive link list at
4630646 im not sure exactly what john terry said but with young players such as anderson wayne rooney cristiano ronaldo and nani the possibility for improvement is definitely there for us in fact i think thats the most natural thing you can say about our club these players have the capacity to improve and they will theres no doubt about that this team will win a lot more championships even long after ive gone thats the nature of the club there are good foundations to win more championships
4630647 when we won the world club championship in 1999 for some reason it seemed to be passed over but we are the only british team to have won it liverpool have never won it so i cannot understand why we did not get the praise or the publicity that we deserved to go halfway around the world and beat palmeiras the best team in south america at that time was a real achievement
4630648 thats not actually my target in life my target has already been achieved as far as liverpool are concerned in terms of ending their dominance
4630649 obviously you can never have too many strikers although i dont actually think we need to improve on too much from last season
4630650 we have to protect the dinosaurs a little bit more ryan giggs and paul scholes and gary neville but they are fit guys giggss endurance tests were the best in the club this summer which is unbelievable scholes and neville are much the same theres a lot of football left in them all plus im expecting a natural progression with the younger players
4630651 we are delighted with how he is doing and were pencilling him in for the beginning of october
4630652 improvement can come in a number of different ways for ronaldo
4630653 forty two goals is the target and it is still possible for him to achieve it given the talent of the boy but you have to say its a big target for him what we will see is improvement in his authority and decision making
4630654 you can say good morning and he replies but if you dont speak to him he does speak to you we need to put fire in anelka i need to work in his head
4630655 he lampard said to me mister i have signed for five years and i said great because i am here for two and maybe more and maybe we talked about how he could be my assistant after that
4630656 hes a great player for chelsea and a symbol of the club he doesnt need to say anything about me he only needs to help me in the field
4630657 the idea is to put on the field to play our game as similar as brazilian football as we can
4630658 but i have players who are made for english football the characteristics are different we try to learn things about dribbling control the ball pass the ball touch the ball one twos we try we have some players who play similar to those in brazil but others not

4630667 anyone can become disabled i think people realize that its a great equalizer
4630668 most families have somebody a relative who is disabled and people will empathize with that
4630669 this will put people on notice that the state of ohio views those actions with the same severity as they do crimes against any other group
4630670 after i got hurt i knew there was still a future in shooting
4630671 why sit ins marches and so forth isnt negotiation a better path you are quite right in calling for negotiation indeed this is the very purpose of direct action nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue it seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored
4630672 well i dont know what will happen now weve got some difficult days ahead but it doesnt matter with me now because ive been to the mountaintop and i dont mind like anybody i would like to live a long life longevity has its place but im not concerned about that now i just want to do gods will and hes allowed me to go up to the mountain and ive looked over and ive seen the promised land i may not get there with you but i want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land and im happy tonight im not worried about anything im not fearing any man my eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord

4630676 although we started this as a demonstration for the summer we received many requests to continue the program to help increase the mobility of our senior citizens
4630677 my basic philosophy is not to take no for an answer
4630678 taking no allows the system to go on if i get a yes theyve broken the rule and weve made a breakthrough the system starts to change
4630679 its a sad commentary that were back on the amas doorstep about the same issue
4630680 its an even sadder commentary that after 15 years the ama still has the same arrogant paternalistic attitude about people with disabilities and that theyre so afraid of us theyd rather see us arrested than sit at the table and work together with us
4630681 with the swipe of a pen a doctor can take away your freedom by sending you to a nursing home when youre discharged from a hospital rather than exploring options in the community
4630682 i can only wonder if a number of those referrals come because many doctors have ownership interest in nursing homes
4630683 if the ama thinks that today is the end of our fight they are sadly mistaken
4630684 we are no longer asking for charity we are demanding our rights

4630693 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died

4630699 our complaint alleges an affinity fraud of very large scale
4630700 in this case one of the defendants used his extensive connections in the orthodox jewish community to solicit more than 250 million from unsuspecting investors
4630701 when we call to mind the image of a mark who has just been separated from his money we sometimes attempt to account for the greatness of his anger by the greatness of his financial loss
4630702 she in fact has a new management team in place and lots of ambitious plans
4630703 its a new chapter in her life and shes anxious to put her stamp on the club
4630704 they have merely wanted to be paid what they were owed and for the club to be on the financial footing it is now on
4630705 we remain hopeful that well see a tentative agreement this weekend

4630708 this is a devastating blow everyone was incredibly excited because this was going to be a fantastic research tool and one of the big events in the world of ancestry
4630709 we use the microfiches in hereford now but it takes a long time and it is not always legible
4630710 it has reduced access to this data and means people still have to pay and wait to access certificates
4630711 despite repeated warnings the government dogmatically ploughed on and outsourced this important and sensitive work to the private sector
4630712 yet again a private sector company has pocketed millions of pounds of taxpayers money for an incomplete job

4630721 she didnt know them too well but they would say hello and have a chit chat and said they were very nice she is very scared after what happened she was literally feet away when the murders were being carried out and yet she heard nothing
4630722 it is really them oh my god how come they both are wonderful people the girl always smiles and the boy is very well mannered
4630723 my friend told me they were planning to return back to china getting married and start a small business
4630724 the deceased man was my classmate in my language class hes pretty clever and tall too sad he is a very good cook
4630725 killing a cat has no meaning in chinese culture at all if they had had a dog they probably would have killed that its simply a warning sign
4630726 the way in which they were killed was so ruthless that i think it must have been a professional
4630727 we have some triad but compared to other big cities such as manchester theyre third division

4630735 what we didnt know was whether the french could improve again you can never expect to win each one of us looked at our contribution and at how we could improve it but this isnt just about the three of us its about the whole squad our support staff are the best in the world and there were four riders left out of the team one of them here and three back home who are all world class athletes

4630761 a lot of patients wont go out because they are embarrassed by those movements

4630767 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4630768 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4630769 yahoo has said it expects to generate an additional 250 million to 450 million in additional cash flow in the first 12 months after the agreement goes into effect
4630770 they have me hanging out with a lot of people ive never met

4630775 i thought only about having fun dancing going to watch films going to the theatre
4630776 i loved dancing preferably with nice looking boys my mother used to say to me you want boys to like you to surround you to admire you and if you become a nun and i would tell her for god i will leave the boys alone
4630777 i knew what it was to have your heart beat fast
4630778 we were taught never to tell a man you loved him i thought about it but i had chosen god i have no regrets
4630779 in a world where people feel theyre being lied to we love those who put into practice the ideas they proclaim
4630780 the system is not set in stone im open to reform long term there are a number of things were looking at the making good progress pilot is one of those but it would be wrong to rush into a change straight away
4630781 many markers have lost confidence in the system and even with ets out of the picture it will be difficult to deliver a wholly successful system in 2009
4630782 it is simply not possible for the qca to appoint a new test contractor to deliver the sats exams for 2009
4630783 at the beginning i was really nervous because its a huge animal
4630784 he was right underneath us and i thought holy cow how are we going to kill it
4630785 we were very close to the animal actually we were touching it with the canoe when we struck at the beginning
4630786 theyre so proud of the hunters and for the community
4630787 we identified that there was a sufficient number of whales to allow three hunts in nunavut and nunavik
4630788 it was a very rapid hunt so it is very unlikely that the animal actually suffered
4630789 i still feel it im about to cry myself its not just for our community its for all of nunavik
4630790 a lot of people are amazed by seeing that animal
4630791 i learned about the parks what kind of trees what kind of plants grow
4630792 the seniors they real easy to cope with like theyd tell you different things youll learn in life teach you a lot so different tools youll need for when you get older
4630793 doing positive things like helping the community just keeping it clean keeping the environment clean
4630794 we have lots of reports of 30 or 50 animals in one place
4630795 they are obviously gathering for a reason but right now we are not sure what that is or how they know to show up at these spots
4630796 there is already collaboration in terms of information sharing and there will probably be more in the future
4630797 none of the tags have been resighted in the northern gulf
4630798 that doesnt mean none of the sharks have traveled there the tags could have been shed or they might not have been seen but after tagging 700 you think theyd have spotted something up there
4630799 when you talk about a species that travels thousands of miles and knows no political boundaries collaboration between scientists is essential
4630800 we wanted to know what the whale sharks were doing in a school of tuna
4630801 these guys see a lot of stuff out there and they never think to contact us and we had not been contacting them
4630802 a third of our sightings are of groups of animals
4630803 we had a sighting of 30 or so a few weeks ago off the coast of texas
4630804 a roadhouse cabaret dance hall night club tavern or other similar place
4630805 the advice we had previously was not from an attorney
4630806 there needs to be a paper trail to fall back on
4630807 its a big win for t man i think he might have a fairly happy weekend
4630808 shes got a little bit of hair its a bit of a reddish tint
4630809 anybody out there whos got kids knows its just a certain kind of feeling that you can only experience when you do it
4630810 im not looking forward to having to go on tour and having to leave
4630811 they say a lot of it delivery has to do with how your sister and your mother gave birth so luckily my sisters had four children and that was pretty easy for her too
4630812 my mum was a nurse too and also shes a midwife so we were surrounded but we also had wonderful nurses at the hospital
4630813 im embarrassed now thats too much information on a breakfast show
4630814 keith and i are both appealing to the press and stuff just to give us a little space so we can walk around sydney and show the baby our town
4630815 shes tiny shes like a doll shes like a little little thing
4630816 just dont photograph right in her face or in our faces because its scary for her

4630860 for with what judgment you judge you will be judged and with the same measure you use it will be measured back to you

4630899 we have relocated him to an aquarium in germany henry doesnt seem to be any the worse for wear even though he has lost one of his four teeth
4630900 he just came to a point where he felt he couldnt go on like that

4630902 theyll continue to improve his throwing just keeps on moving forward
4630903 our idea is to have him pitch here at the end of the year
4630904 the protests mainly came from christian fundamentalist circles in the united states and eventually spilled over into germany
4630905 so it came from people who neither had the knowledge of the seriousness of alfred hrdlickas work nor had seen the exhibition

4630929 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4630930 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4630931 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4630932 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4630933 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4630934 they say that opposites attract but it seems the pill may be preventing women sniffing out men who are opposite enough but researchers found that the pill disrupts a womans power to recognise the aroma of a suitable partner
4630935 mhc correlated odour preferences in humans and the use of oral contraceptives
4630936 almost 100 women then sniffed the shirts and gave their opinions on the pleasantness and desirability of the odour twice over a three month period

4630957 bow out of politics continue to support the interim government or turn around and oppose the charter and interim government
4630958 hes perfectly capable of turning around and support his former adversaries such as qarase and marginalizing his former friends
4630959 remember he is a politician with a multiple reservoir of political arsenal when he is cornered he can be dangerous like a wounded tiger
4630960 at the moment that seems to be what people are saying in reality if you control the money you virtually control everything
4630961 chaudhry has been a strong force in the interim government and perhaps the most hardworking of the lot
4630962 people have long suspected that the most innocuous proposal to change just a few provisions of the 1987 charter would open the floodgates to sweeping political reforms that would perpetuate certain officials primarily arroyo in power beyond 2010 she has already eroded any public trust that is indispensable in making any peace pact succeed
4630963 if the administration wants to salvage this peace effort it should learn the virtues of transparency at the very least it should put a stop to its scheming self serving and machiavellian plots
4630964 but we were able to see through her ruse and ploy to justify charter change allowing her to remain in power in a parliamentary system
4630965 arroyo was never serious or sincere in respecting the bangsamoros right to self determination her megalomaniac obsession and unscrupulous cunning has placed her political ambition above morality her machiavellian schemes had resulted to renewal of conflict and deaths of many in mindanao
4630966 though namfrel was not as actively involved in the just concluded august 11 armm elections it continues to advocate concretely for good governance through our volunteers efforts in assisting particularly the procurement and delivery of textbooks by the deped and medicines by the doh

4630968 the way the real estate agents presented it it was like a comforting thing
4630969 its about as oppressive a condition as you can imagine were going to force you from your home
4630970 in this economic market it would of course mean that people would stand to lose money
4630971 given the current condition of the housing market defendants argue that the forced sale of their home at a price far below what they bought it for in 2004 would cause them considerable financial hardship as they would be forced to come up with additional money to pay off the current mortgage on the home
4630972 the repurchase addendum creates a unilateral right of the plaintiff which can only be enforced by the plaintiff at its own discretion these provisions are illusory and should not be enforced by the court

4631011 the body of a person was located at the rear of the house and forensic examination will be used to identify it
4631012 let us hope that the bishops do not allow the gifts of gloria for their projects to blind them to what she is intent on inflicting on our people they must sound the alarm while it is early lest history accuse them of being blind sentinels
4631013 let us not give the incumbent president any chance to remain in office beyond 2010 anyway she has repeatedly said that she will step down in 2010
4631014 i venture to say that the signs are telling the pastors of the church today and the faithful that president gloria macapagal arroyo has already started putting into effect a plan of action which will lay further and heavier sufferings on our people and that they should marshal all the prophetic courage they have in order to denounce such machinations in order to forestall great harm to our people
4631015 will enable the president to continue in power beyond 2010
4631016 and finally there is the president herself who has time and again shown that she is capable and willing to do anything to save her skin it should be clear by now that her girlish appearance masks a political astuteness and craftiness that at least equals that of marcos
4631017 after lying low for a while the president lets the cat out of the bag by supporting the move towards federalism and as if on cue her allies let it be known that there will be a need for charter change and that the changes need not be limited to the issue of federalism

4631024 if 300 people are taken to denvers temporary detention facility within a short time frame processing those persons at the rate of 30 to 50 per hour would take at least 6 to 10 hours
4631025 during the republican national convention in new york city in 2004 nearly 1 100 people were arrested in a four hour period if a similar situation occurred in denver it would take at least 22 to 36 hours to process those persons
4631026 very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
4631027 at the temporary facility denver will of course also be required to provide for detainees basic human needs such as adequate food and drinking water access to toilets and facilities for washing and access to medical care if necessary
4631028 detainees must also be allowed the opportunity for bodily movement including release from handcuffs or flexicuffs
4631029 denver must establish a system to ensure that detainees are assured of access to medically necessary prescription medications they may be taking some arrestees will need prescription medications that are in the possession of family members who were not arrested denver will have to arrange a system to receive the medications from family members and then deliver them to the appropriate prisoner failure to deliver appropriate and necessary medications could result in serious deterioration and damage to a detainees health
4631030 this facility will not be used for long term detention
4631031 arrestees who are processed at this facility will be there for no more than the few hours it requires for processing water bathrooms medical staff and phones will be available to them the facility will be fully staffed to ensure its safe and secure operation

4631051 it does make you feel youre doing something a bit different
4631052 theres much more reliance on your own judgment and therefore much more satisfaction
4631053 i look for really steep rock faces that havent been climbed before because theyre too hard
4631054 its an exercise in mental control i spend a huge amount of time planning every single scenario on the route in the moment of the climb im intently focused but relaxed at the same time
4631055 its probably a bit hard to understand but the summit isnt everything
4631056 its how you get there that counts thats the point of modern mountaineering youre searching for the ultimate steep line up a face and doing it in a minimalist approach two people completely unsupported carrying all their equipment on their backs
4631057 the emotions are all the same the anxiety the challenge and the fun
4631058 youre living in a vertical world you can only move around by climbing
4631059 clients want to do things like mont blanc because theyve heard of that

4631116 va bien va adelantada me parece que las cosas van caminando bien pero ya me lleg una opci n que pues es muy interesante y que yo ya conoc a que pod a suceder y que pod a ir tomando cada vez m s fuerza y ahora la est tomando
4631117 de todas formas queremos ser justos con la situaci n del betis como primera opci n pero la pr xima semana se decide si es betis o roma
4631118 obviamente tenemos que analizar con mucho mucho cuidado y detenimiento qu es lo que va a pasar si bien roma va a jugar champions y lo que significa roma tambi n tenemos que ser realistas y ver qu nos van a ofrecer si nery va a ser un jugador importante
4631119 depende de nosotros no es por pretensiones nosotros no vamos a exprimir a nadie para ser mercenarios e irnos con el que ofrezca m s para nada es una decisi n en la que tenemos que ser lo m s conscientes de lo que se va a hacer tenemos que ser muy cuidadosos y no es cosa de dinero para nada
4631120 no soy agresivo llevo cinco expulsiones en toda mi carrea
4631121 despu s de tanto tiempo de estar en este deporte y jugar desde los cinco a os entiendo que dejar con un hombre menos a tu equipo siempre es contraproducente
4631122 entonces no me preocupa o me hace pensar que soy un tipo agresivo como para recibir una expulsi n cada cinco partidos pues m s all de eso nunca tuve problemas con demasiadas tarjetas rojas o sumar gran cantidad de amonestaciones ahora hay que mirar hacia adelante y ser m s inteligente para evitar expulsiones
4631123 estamos obviamente dolidos y preocupado por la salud de carlos pero lamentablemente nos hay manera de posponer las cosas y que nuestro compa ero se mejore m s r pido de lo normal
4631124 no olvidamos que no hemos tenido el mejor desempe o y un buen espect culo en este inicio de torneo que nos permita ser protagonistas pero m s all de eso nos preocupa m s el tema de carlitos y despu s la parte deportiva
4631125 s la experiencia cuenta pero igual hay que aplicarse m s dentro de la cancha no podemos regalar nada me parece que todos podemos dar un poco m s y el equipo lo necesita individualmente trabajar de otra forma
4631126 no no es normal por supuesto que no para un equipo como toluca pero as es la realidad est en nosotros cambiarlo lo bueno es que s lo depende de nosotros de nadie m s entonces debemos seguir trabajando mentalizarnos al doble que siempre hemos sido ganadores
4631127 si todos los partidos fueran como el primer tiempo no nos preocupar a pero la realidad es otra tenemos que ser inteligentes analizar y no caer en desesperaciones todo lo contrario saber que el domingo tenemos un partido que podemos ganar y mejorar la situaci n un triunfo nos vendr a mejor que un empate eso est claro
4631128 el gamper siempre es especial es la fiesta del barcelona a la que viene mucha gente que no son socios y con mucha juventud en las gradas es una noche para disfrutarla tanto los seguidores como yo mismo como entrenador
4631129 hist ricamente han venido equipos de gran nivel al trofeo joan gamper y el boca es uno de los grandes clubes del mundo habr la presentaci n oficial del equipo con jugadores nuevos el p blico ver novedades en nuestro juego hay suficientes motivos para volver a venir a barcelona cenar y disfrutar de un buen espect culo
4631130 pierde mucho si se anula al pony porque es un jugador que pone pases siempre est en movimiento y es desequilibrante
4631131 pero igual tienen a sandoval el negro a robert de pinho que va a pelear todas y otros jugadores que intentar n hacer da o pero principalmente es el pony quien m s desequilibra
4631132 creo que nosotros debemos dejar de preocuparnos de los rbitros hay que hacer un buen partido y ya el rbitro pasar a segundo t rmino de nuestra parte hacer lo nuestro hay que jugar bien y sacar los tres puntos
4631133 no habr marca especial pero es alguien que a lo mejor ahora va intentar hacer m s de lo que normalmente est haciendo va a querer mostrar algo m s y hay que estar muy atentos
4631134 es bueno para un espect culo porque jugar a las cinco de la tarde es un calor muy pesado y mantener un ritmo de juego es dif cil
4631135 es un equipo donde jugu un a o y seguro algo especial hay pero ahora uno est jugando ac en monterrey y hay que salir a ganar
4631136 creo que de a poco estoy consciente que puedo dar mucho m s y cuando uno est en la banca es dif cil porque entras a otro ritmo y te cuesta cinco o diez minutos adaptarse
4631137 estoy listo en el momento que el profe sergio ordu a lo requiera si el grupo lo requiere si me toca o no me toca ac lo m s importante es que el grupo est bien necesitamos puntos para que no se nos empiecen a alejar los rivales de la porcentual
4631138 si alguien quiere jugar se soy yo vine a aportar experiencia ganas me estoy jugando la carrera y vengo por una revancha son muchas cosas por las que estoy ac y por las que tengo ganas de salir adelante demostrar dentro del campo el por qu me trajeron por qu alguna fui considerado en su momento uno de los mejores porteros
4631139 coincido que las oportunidades se ganan dentro de la cancha
4631140 el t cnico mencion que a partir de que perdimos contra toluca fecha 2 habr a oportunidad para todos as que hoy que se me vuelve a dar la oportunidad obviamente me siento contento y con entusiasmo de aprovecharla al m ximo y demostrar que puedo regresar a la titularidad
4631141 no es excusa pero me costar un poco de trabajo pues a n no estoy en ritmo desde la pretemporada no tuve la oportunidad de participar mucho y en el torneo ya van tres juegos que no participo sin embargo me siento bien y repito que tratar de aprovechar al m ximo esta oportunidad
4631142 nunca hable nada ni mucho menos dije algo malo a ustedes medios s lo comente en una entrevista que a nadie le gusta estar en la banca pues lamentablemente o afortunadamente pueden jugar once nada m s y los dem s debemos esperar y apoyar fuera de la cancha el t cnico exige al parejo y no hay nada personal entiendo que la exigencia es fuerte para todos para todo el grupo la instituci n y la gente que est aqu entonces hay que tomarla de esa manera por eso tambi n estoy convencido que se tiene que hablar dentro de la cancha y no pedir la oportunidad por medio de la prensa
4631143 voy muy entusiasmado de hacer bien las cosas mas que nada de obtener los tres puntos que ser an muy ben ficos para el paso del equipo pero sabemos todos que pachuca ser un rival complicado por que est conformado de muy buenos jugadores que tratan bien la pelota y la filosof a de su t cnico es la din mica creo que tanto para pachuca como para nosotros ser importante sacar un buen resultado lo que provocar un buen juego
4631144 esa situaci n es muy aparte m s que afectarnos nos tiene que dar mucha fuerza much simo esp ritu y redoblar esfuerzos para brindarle todo a carlos quien necesita toda nuestra fuerza antes de iniciar el partido tenemos en mente sacar unas mantas y portar algunas playeras para darle una muestra de apoyo a su familia
4631145 la mejor a que ha tenido el guadalajara se debe a la creencia que hemos tenido en nosotros mismos en el potencial que tenemos para salir adelante
4631146 cada d a me siento mejor f sicamente lo m s importante es la concentraci n y la confianza que recobramos en ese triunfo debo mejorar en los encares y la movilidad
4631147 m s autocr ticos en lo que hemos estado fallando para mejorar en las jornadas que vienen
4631148 as lo vemos todos en el equipo pero ante necaxa debemos estar alertas porque tienen siempre la misma forma de jugar aguantan muy bien desdoblan con rapidez lo cual considero debemos cuidar mucho
4631149 primero cada quien haga sus propias tareas lo cual ser a bueno y lo dem s vendr a para beneficio del equipo
4631150 i try to talk to you but i dont know what to say i am afraid you dont want me to say anything so i dont but inside of me there are words waiting to come out and tell you how i feel like how i miss you and how i love you despite my broken heart and how i need you in my life and especially how much i want you but those words may forver stay in my heart locked inside sometimes i wonder if there are words locked inside you too but ill never know

4631155 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4631156 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4631157 has it come to this has the magical impact of george lucas original vision of star wars been reduced to the level of saturday morning animation
4631158 its a deadening film that cuts corners on its animation and slumbers through a plot that a makes us feel like weve seen it all before and b makes us wish we hadnt

4631160 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
4631161 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
4631162 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
4631163 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips

4631172 after speaking to joel and hearing of his heartbreaking long wait to see doctors i just knew that i couldnt leave without securing him the treatment he so desperately needed so i worked with local doctors to get him all the help they could offer
4631173 joels problems were a very severe facial deformity as a result of a tumour growing in the middle of his face which was steadily growing twisting and rotating his face through approximately 90 degrees and pushing his eye sideways and outwards several centimetres
4631174 joels face was transformed in one major procedure and although the minor bruising around joels eye may take a while to completely resolve the transformation after his surgery is incredible
4631175 he can now look forward to a future that until now was destined to be bleak
4631176 he is the most fabulous little boy full of life smiles and bubbly enthusiasm
4631177 he will live life to the full whatever is thrown at him and is just absolutely charming he is very bright and has learnt remarkably good english very quickly
4631178 it has been a real pleasure to be able to help
4631179 i am so happy to be alive and that everything went so well im looking forward to going home and will work hard and study to become a doctor so that i can help people also
4631180 i see such a wonderful change in joel and only god can know how happy i am for having the opportunity for joel to come to london for his surgery
4631181 i do not have words to thank lisa bryer the surgeons and everyone at facing the world
4631182 joel is a delight it is not often that you are privileged to meet someone who lights up every room that he walks into and to have had the opportunity to give him a future that he always deserved has been an honour

4631190 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4631191 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4631192 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4631193 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4631194 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field

4631196 my fathers a farmer and we have a lot of egg laying hens one time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying and broke and made a mess
4631197 our family are farmers too but we raise chickens for the meat market we had a dozen eggs one time but when they hatched we only got ten live chicks and the moral to this story is dont count your chickens until theyre hatched
4631198 that was a fine story lucy johnny do you have a story to share
4631199 yes maam my daddy told me this story about my uncle henry uncle henry was a green beret in vietnam and his helicopter got hit he had to crash land in enemy territory and all he had was a bottle of whiskey a machine gun and a machete he drank the whiskey on the way down so it wouldnt break and then he landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops he killed seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of bullets then he killed twenty more with the machete till the blade broke and then he killed the last ten with his bare hands
4631200 what kind of moral did your daddy tell you from that horrible story
4631201 but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own
4631202 humble yourselves therefore under gods mighty hand that he may lift you up in due time cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you

4631225 you dont know that your family members are that involved you hear people talk about them but when you hear it over and over i didnt realize that rodney was that involved in the community
4631226 last week he stopped for a lady who was in chemotherapy and had a flat tire she called me this week and for the life of me i dont know who she was but he stopped and fixed her flat tire last week i loved him with all my heart he was my best friend my match made in heaven mentor he was my lover friend my sons father and i just love him so much and thank him for everything hes given me
4631227 i think what weve all learned is that rodney touched a lot of people its hard to understand how 1 person can make such an impact and not be an elected official not an ambassador not someone that people look up to as being that kind of leader in the community but sometime that leader comes from the people who live in the community thats what rodney did
4631228 it was a community wake it allowed the community to come out and deal with the crime that was committed not against rodney not against shelia and the kids but against the community thats what i want everybody to know that we have laws and those laws were broken and justice needs to take place

4631264 i started out in commercial art doing advertising the landscapes of the midwest and now the southwest have been my biggest inspiration over the years but these days i am finding a deep interest in portraiture
4631265 one of the questions that she will tupically ask me as shes doing a painting or a series

4631267 i really do see a lot of energy and enthusiasm about the arts particularly with the arts and culture designation
4631268 i see this with the new arts trail that is in the process of being formed along with the already formed weaving trail these will bring people to las vegas and will help the whole community not just artists its an exciting time in las vegas and we both feel so lucky to be here at this time

4631280 im sure that the team plan was to throw it right at the guys head no game in baseball is worth that as far as im concerned
4631281 the ball hit the bat and then hit him in the face
4631282 but thats the way this competition is and you have to go out and play
4631283 basically you get a base hit and you have a good shot at winning the game whereas in a normal game you just got a guy on first you have to battle to get the guy home
4631284 he was a very nice person smiling all the time and making other people laugh
4631285 he was very down to earth he loved his family and he was a very dedicated guy
4631286 theres a lot of not so great music out there today

4631308 the usa is busy with its own missile defense system it does not intend to defend poland at this point poland lays itself open to attack giving the usa a permission to deploy the system the country may become an object of russias reaction such targets are destroyed in the first instance

4631313 you try and get out in front but its all about doing everything well the match racing i have had before in the americas cup will help but these medal races can quite often kick up something up
4631314 the pressure is certainly not off i wish it was i just have to keep my head screwed on
4631315 we had always prepared for a close final race but its going to be tough
4631316 im very lucky to be sailing with them and we all see things the same way its always been about coming home with the gold
4631317 but we hung in obviously we will all have a few butterflies in the final race but we know we have to beat the dutch
4631318 i do not want to build a ceiling but sound travels up very easily
4631319 ive already put in insulation r 13 and added a layer of drywall in the window frames the plan is to set in another frame that contains drywall insulation to be flush with the rest of the front wall which i will then drywall i got this idea from the f alten everest book even with one layer the sound is a lot less
4631320 i sat on my mum and dads bed they had a small television and i remember going in to see it
4631321 i could have done with more time when your biggest week of running is two weeks before the race
4631322 its not an ideal preparation and its not what you would risk going into any other race but the olympic games is not a race i ever want to watch on television and think what i could have done in there ive seen all the coe ovett races from 1980 it is not about a particular race but the whole aura and ethos of the olympics
4631323 i could not run any further when i got to where i got to in athens
4631324 if i had run an absolutely perfect race it would not have been any different that is the problem i was ill going into it
4631325 this year i am in a better situation than in athens because i am healthy i was not healthy going into it there i did a lot more training and i was in better shape two weeks before that race in athens i was in outstanding shape but it did not work out on the day
4631326 i know its going to be tough and i am going to fight harder than i have ever fought but i am looking forward to it i have fought harder than ever to get to this point so i just want to go in there and do everyone justice there has always been a big support team around me but this time there has been hundreds of people really weighing in to help get me here
4631327 if you are not in the race you cannot win the race but by getting myself to this point i have put myself in as good a position as i could have done if i look back over the last 12 weeks i dont think there was any point where i could have done any more
4631328 i am glad i pushed it at every opportunity but in the time limit it was really hard and just having got this far gives me a mental lift going into the race
4631329 its important for me to go out there and run well but i do not think its the defining moment of my career there have been other things in my career which will define it hopefully there are other things i am going on to achieve

4631456 it is too early to speak to the possibility of software plus services being abused or speculate on whether or not it will have a positive impact on software piracy
4631457 where will the business software alliance come into play how will end users know that what they are using is legal if a business is fully reliant upon hosted software and that company is running illegal software the bsa could essentially put that end user out of business by shutting down the illegal hosting company
4631458 i definitely think well see a lot of software piracy go away but as with any subscription based service people are probably going to be playing with licensing numbers and i think this will make user authentication models even more important
4631459 most violations that i see are due to ignorance not reading or understanding those complex license agreements or trusting an unscrupulous technician who probably offered a solution for way under the price of any competitors

4631503 mccain now has enough financial resources to break tradition and advertise during the oppositions convention week
4631504 the mccain camp is building a case about obamas ability to lead and needs to keep the pressure on his weakness with voters
4631505 the ads are less an effort to get votes than make a point and get it covered by the national media while obama has the attention of the nation

4631518 i was having problems with my timing but when i made a passing shot on a set point i started feeling better
4631519 i was up 5 3 in the first set and i lost my serve and then she won her serve and it was 5 5 and then were in a tiebreaker where anything can happen
4631520 if i would have had a little more focus i could have held serve and won the first set 6 3 but she has a lot of experience she was battling for every point even when she was down 5 2
4631521 i decided to just focus on every point and i started feeling better
4631522 i was able to play my game in the second set and i guess she had trouble with it
4631523 i was fighting it it still hurts ill have to get treatment on it and get ready for the u s open

4631545 we are totally committed to giving our customers the lowest prices in britain every day of the year

4631565 this wasnt something she was itching for looking for but so many of her supporters said it was important to them and the obama people got how important it was to smooth over any tensions and that it was the right thing to do
4631566 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4631567 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4631571 we hold that the changes called creation and procreation are divine and that human sexuality is to humans the most available expression of that function of divinity
4631572 sexual activity is the greatest act a human can do
4631573 the defendants design was to operate a church oriented school which is free of any governmental regulation for the ostensible purpose of education when their real goal was to gratify their own deviant sexual desires
4631574 he preys on at least he did the people who believed in him
4631575 thanks to the christian crazies who were and are so influential in this country america has criminalized more sexual conduct than any other western nation
4631576 there is nothing injurious to sexuality its good and pleasant not an evil children exposed to it are simply not injured

4631582 this means that many people might not be getting enough hours to meet their needs even when they have a job
4631583 whats really worrying is that people who are underemployed have a wellbeing score that is no better than people who are unemployed
4631584 better for us to be too busy rather than not busy enough
4631585 many people would like to work less hours but in most cases their happiness is not actually at risk from their busy workload
4631586 this is only a formality so it looks good on paper and we can make more money but the child and family doesnt really matter
4631587 tetapi saya melihatnya pp tersebut justru kontradiksi dengan kebijakan wajib belajar yang tertuang dalam undang undang uu 20 2003 tentang sistem pendidikan nasional sebab dalam pp pendanaan pendidikan justru diatur soal pungutan ini jelas mencerminkan ambigu sikap pemerintah
4631588 apakah ini berarti kebebasan untuk melakukan pungutan di sekolah dilegalkan oleh pemerintah
4631589 mengenai pungutan oleh satuan pendidikan untuk memenuhi tanggung jawab kontribusi peserta didik orangtua atau wali dalam pp tersebut secara tegas disebutkan bahwa dana yang diperoleh harus disimpan dalam rekening atas nama satuan pendidikan pp tersebut jelas menyebutkan bahwa pungutan yang didapat dari masyarakat harus dibukukan secara khusus oleh satuan pendidikan
4631590 sangat disesalkan setiap kali masyarakat dan dpr menanyakan kepada mendiknas soal pungutan psb tetapi mendiknas bambang sudibyo selalu berdalih bahwa hal itu kewenangan pemerintah daerah padahal seharusnya lewat pp pendanaan pendidikan tersebut pemerintah pusat juga mengatur dan memberi rambu rambu

4631600 learning is a developmental process what are the differences between the kind of thinking we might expect of students who are just beginning study of a field and those who are ready to graduate how do we design courses in our disciplines that consciously assist students to develop as learners
4631601 students may find courses interesting in their own right or for personal idiosyncratic reasons but at the institutional and organizational levels courses are meaningful only if students can plot them as locations on a graduation check sheet defining a temporally structured route to a particular degree progress on these paths however does not imply movement toward understanding and knowledge

4631643 rasululullah s a w telah melakukan kejadian kejadian penting dalam sejarah beliau seperti khutbah khutbah dan perjanjian perjanjian beliau pada hari badar hunain khandaq pembukaan makkah hijrah masuk madinah tidak seharusnya hari hari itu dijadikan hari raya karena yang melakukan seperti itu adalah umat nasrani atau yahudi yang menjadikan semua kejadian isa hari raya hari raya merupakan bagian dari syariat apa yang disyariatkan itulah yang diikuti kalau tidak maka telah membuat sesuatu yang baru dalam agama maka apa yang dilakukan orang memperingati maulid antara mengikuti tradisi nasrani yang memperingati kelahiran isa atau karena cinta rasulullah allah mungkin akan memberi pahala atas kecintaan dan ijtihad itu tapi tidak atas bidah dengan menjadikan maulid nabi sebagai hari raya orang orang salaf tidak melakukan itu padahal mereka lebih mencintai rasul
4631644 bidah yang baik itu sunnah dilakukan begitu juga memperingati hari maulid rasulullah
4631645 menurut saya asal perayaan maulid nabi saw yaitu manusia berkumpul membaca dan kisah kisah teladan nabi saw sejak kelahirannya sampai perjalanan hidupnya kemudian dihidangkan makanan yang dinikmati bersama setelah itu mereka pulang hanya itu yang dilakukan tidak lebih semua itu tergolong bidah hasanah orang yang melakukannya diberi pahala karena mengagungkan derajat nabi saw menampakkan suka cita dan kegembiraan atas kelahiran nabi muhamad saw yang mulia
4631646 dari abi qotadah al anshori ra sesungguhnya rasulullah saw pernah ditanya mengenai puasa hari senin rasulullah saw menjawab pada hari itu aku dilahirkan dan wahyu diturunkan kepadaku
4631647 perayaan maulid harus dilakukan dengan berdzikir kepada allah swt mensyukuri kenikmatan allah swt atas kelahiran rasulullah saw dan dilakukan dengan cara yang sopan khusyu serta jauh dari hal hal yang diharamkan dan bidah yang munkar
4631648 kelahiran nabi saw adalah kenikmatan terbesar untuk kita sementara wafatnya beliau adalah musibah terbesar atas kita sedangkan syariat memerintahkan kita untuk menampakkan rasa syukur atas nikmat dan bersabar serta diam dan merahasiakan atas cobaan yang menimpa terbukti agama memerintahkan untuk menyembelih kambing sebagai aqiqoh pada saat kelahiran anak dan tidak memerintahkan menyembelih hewan pada saat kematian maka kaidah syariat menunjukkan bahwa yang baik pada bulan ini adalah menampakkan kegembiraan atas kelahiran rasulullah saw bukan menampakkan kesusahan atas musibah yang menimpa

4631693 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4631694 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4631695 russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is no longer 1968
4631696 not only those people who perpetrated this but those who failed to stop it
4631697 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4631698 therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
4631699 poland in deploying elements of the system opens itself to a that is 100 percent
4631700 we very much want the six point plan to be implemented very promptly so that russian troops are no longer in georgia outside

4631703 obviously were not suggesting employers throw their caution to the wind that is not the case what were hoping that employers do is give a person a second chance
4631704 we wanted to control minimize the stress we had job seekers register then go through a series of pre event workshops
4631705 basically that helped us screen out those who were not motivated and those who were highly motivated
4631706 the thing that gets to me is that people dont consider that you did anything before you got into trouble you make one mistake and its all over
4631707 i think thats what this was supposed to be today
4631708 that people would just say were going to give you a chance but even then theyre jobs theyre not careers
4631709 in my mind it will stop the shredding of the fabric of our community we must put opportunities in front of our children so that they can go to work and earn a living

4631716 this year youll see an even bigger difference because of the economy
4631717 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4631718 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4631719 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4631720 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4631721 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now

4631723 we followed up as many leads as we had we always considered moore a person of interest but back in 2003 we didnt have enough to make the case
4631724 the article came out in the paper and based on that we started getting new leads
4631725 if there is anything i am lacking in ive got to tell you it is taste in music and art and other great things in life
4631726 ive got to say that a lot of my taste in music stopped about the time i impacted a surface to air missile with my own airplane and never caught up again

4631873 i have no grudge against the manager rafa benitez when he started playing one up front he was always going to play torres and it was not something that i had any qualms about

4631875 and obviously my memories of my time at liverpool are fantastic what a great club to have played for i have got only fond memories of my time there
4631876 great great memories every goal i scored in front of the kop you just cant beat that feeling
4631877 it would be quite simple to not do too much
4631878 it would be quite easy to sit there and come off the bench for liverpool now and then you get paid the same
4631879 if you are part of the big club you can pretend to lift trophies its quite easy to do that its certainly not in my nature at the end of my career i could say i have won this and i have won that but looking at myself in the mirror have i really won that
4631880 thats certainly something that crossed my mind when i decided to leave i thought i cannot look myself in the mirror and say i have actually won that if i have not been part of the team

4631933 one possible explanation for this failure to access wmi data remotely is that a firewall is blocking that traffic if the friendly name were actually represented as tfs q somedomain com as is the form in the referenced blog post that could drive traffic that would otherwise be local through a proxy server an address with s in it would not be considered a local address when interpreting the setting that determines whether to bypass a proxy server for local addresses the traffic would then leave the box which would mean that you would need the dcom port open tcp 135

4631952 it will be genuinely unfortunate if they are forced to close their doors
4631953 that products for military use arent being sold to countries that might have an improper and criminal use for the product
4631954 because companies that violate federal law are the type of company that the government does not want to continue in that particular business
4631955 in 2004 they were charged with a criminal offense because they knowingly willfully violated the federal statute
4631956 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4631957 the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4631958 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4631959 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
4631960 its as old as greek drama theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good

4631962 i grew up believing an evangelical couldnt be a democrat
4631963 when you look at the political party that has traditionally championed poverty social justice and care for the least of these its not been the republican party
4631964 we are to honor the least of these above even ourselves its very difficult to reconcile totally
4631965 i dont think any young evangelical is ignoring the traditional values issues but they are adding other issues including poverty and war and they are also looking at integrity and family
4631966 they tried to feel me out and see where i stood
4631967 impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4631968 impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4631969 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4631970 a higher incentive to stand with us now than they did before now that they have seen what the russians have done in georgia
4631971 the united states stands strongly for the territorial integrity of georgia
4631972 obviously senator obama is putting an awful lot of money into virginia both on the ground and on television and it is a state that has elected democrats recently
4631973 but its one we take very seriously and one we think still leans for us and one we will fight for every single day
4631974 basically you are looking at an even race in virginia
4631975 but we think mccain is a republican who matches up very well in virginia
4631976 they are now seeing the same things we are seeing which is it is really close in virginia
4631977 we are making a strong effort there and we are making that strong effort because we absolutely believe that virginia is in play
4631978 itd probably be good to have a couple around for spares
4631979 the bottom line is that youre getting rid of the stuff
4631980 most cities are strange in the sense that periodically we have very unique things to get rid of
4631981 luckily the internet is making it easier for us to find these things a home
4631982 we didnt know what to do they weighed about 5 tons they were just huge
4631983 there were rumors for a while that had expressed interest in them in bringing them down to neverland
4631984 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4631985 the governor also indicates that she does not believe the charges or circumstances here merit the use of the pardon power

4631991 the situation is still unstable and russia must back up its commitment to stop its violence and violation of georgias sovereignty with actions not just words
4631992 the united states should now join our european partners in direct high level diplomacy with both georgia and russia to seek immediate implementation of a cease fire and to achieve a lasting resolution to this crisis
4631993 hey wait a minute we already have 150 000 troops here we have this what are we talking about

4632003 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
4632004 this is just a very sad day here in quincy

4632040 so when you make them into a movie youd better be shooting for a pretty high standard youre not always going to reach it but you have to be shooting for it were going to make a justice league movie whether its now or 10 years from now but were not going to do it and warners is not going to do it until we know its right
4632041 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4632042 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4632043 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4632044 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4632045 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4632046 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4632065 this forecasting by analogy is a tempting thing to do
4632066 but you have to pick the right analogy the danger of this more subjective approach is that instead of letting the objective facts shape your views you will choose the facts that confirm your existing views
4632067 and youre asking whats the worst thing that could happen the first thing people will say is lets see what nouriel says
4632068 if the underlying conditions call for optimism nouriel would be optimistic
4632069 im not comfortable saying that were going to end up in the great depression
4632070 we are in a recession and denying it is nonsense
4632071 you either nationalize the banks or you nationalize the mortgages

4632094 the omagh fatality list reads like a microcosm of troubles deaths and left no section of irish life untouched the town they attacked is roughly 60 40 catholic protestant and the dead consisted of protestants catholics a mormon and two spanish visitors they killed young old and middle aged fathers mothers sons daughters and grannies they killed republicans and unionists including a prominent local member of the ulster unionist party they killed people from the backbone of the gaelic athletic association they killed unborn twins bright students cheery shop assistants and many young people they killed three children from the irish republic who were up north on a day trip everyone they killed was a civilian the toll of death was thus both extraordinarily high and extraordinarily comprehensive
4632095 im only after getting a call from a man with a country accent saying theres a bomb in omagh main street near the courthouse a 500lb bomb its going to go off in 30 minutes
4632096 i have received a bomb call for omagh town centre approximately 200 yards from the courthouse and the code word malta pope was given
4632097 theres a bomb courthouse omagh main street 500 pounds explosion 30 minutes
4632098 am i through to omagh this is a bomb warning its going to go off in 30 minutes
4632099 part of the ongoing war against the brits we offer apologies to the civilians
4632100 nobody thought there was going to be a bomb in omagh everybody thought it was a hoax
4632101 three women in a shop ill go for a walk somewhere else
4632102 i was just back from my lunch about ten minutes and had walked straight past the car and everything and two minutes before i was hanging out the window cause a girl that i worked with was walking past the bottom she was going out home and you know we were kind of chatting to her out the window i mean if it had went off then id have been killed id say because or a lot worse
4632103 i was in the kitchen and heard a big bang everything fell on me the cupboards blew off the wall the next thing i got blasted out into the street there was smashed glass everywhere bodies children people were inside out
4632104 i met my friend and we decided to go on down to the bus depot and as we were walking down there just past mcelroys shoe shop we were right in the middle of the road then the bomb went off i was thrown to the ground so i was and obviously i couldnt run or nothing and i saw my leg and all well i just thought ill never be able to walk again you know and then you just have to wait for somebody to come so i sat there and there was a lot of screaming around but i didnt i must have been in shock cause i didnt scream or nothing i just sat and waited
4632105 first of all there was like this massive bang which ill and then you just heard you know glass and roofs falling and you know just and then there was silence for a while and then it was like just screaming and shouting and complete mayhem it was quite scary
4632106 there was smoke coming from the brow of the hill and we stopped in our tracks for what seemed like an eternity and then we just ran towards it
4632107 i ran into the front of kells what was left of it and i went in through where the window would have been and i found the wife lying face down in the rubble now the clothes was blew off her and the first thing i reached for was her arm and i tried for her pulse there was no life i knew she was dead and then i couldnt get there was no sign of shauna or tracey and i knew they were in the shop with her and i started lifting lumps of timber and everything was carnage but there was still no sign of shauna and i thought she was dead i thought she was under the rubble thought she was buried under her mother i found tracey my second daughter on her knees beside her mammy trying her pulse like a woman who went to omagh twice a year to do shopping about the only two days she went was to get the uniforms and christmas
4632108 there were limbs lying about that had been blown off people everyone was running round trying to help people there was a girl in a wheelchair screaming for help who was in a bad way there were people with cuts on their heads bleeding one young boy had half of his leg completely blown off he didnt cry or anything he was just in a complete state of shock
4632109 it was horrible so much blood and flesh and glass sticking out of people
4632110 the first thing i noticed was what i suppose was a shop dummy lying in the middle of the street so i knew then there was people injured cause i could see everybody coming running with blood and one thing or another after i passed the first shop dummy that i saw lying in the street out of one of the clothes shops the next thing i saw in the street again was what i thought was another shop dummy but unfortunately that wasnt that was either a man or a woman ive no idea what it was but it was just a body and there were neither legs or arms or anything to be seen on it it was a sight that ill not forget anyway thats for sure and that was only one there was a lot of other sights lying on that street that really yet is still hard to describe how anybody could do that to innocent people i have no idea
4632111 there were bodies strewn all over the street it was like a battlefield of burning flesh and dead bodies with a burst water main spraying everywhere i helped lift six bodies out and did all i could for some of the injured people men women and children were lying on the road dazed and bleeding people were groaning children were crying and there was an overwhelming smell of burning flesh
4632112 there was an awful lot of water because there was burst water mains there were people lying dead and the water was just gushing over the top of them the other striking thing was there was so much blood there was blood literally everywhere an awful lot of blood on the footpath and on the road a lot of the policemen were splattered from head to toe in blood and i really mean that they were putting people who were either dead badly maimed or injured into sheets or anything they could find and just sort of dragging them down to the bottom end of the town they were waiting for any available ambulance or car to put the people into
4632113 to see that body lying in the street with smoke sort of rising from it and the smell on the street
4632114 there were limbs hanging off bodies being carried on doors everything was chaotic then just as the bus was ready to leave the door opened and someone handed a severed arm in i think that was just too much for the driver i think he cried all the way to the hospital
4632115 it was like a scene from hell i wasnt able to drive fast because people were screaming in pain as we went over the ramps at the hospital i could hear the roars of pain
4632116 nothing could have prepared me for what i saw people were lying on the floor with limbs missing and there was blood all over the place people were crying for help and looking for something to kill the pain other people were crying out looking for relatives you could not really be trained for what you had seen unless you were trained in vietnam or somewhere like that
4632117 when i came to the front of the hospital it was absolutely quiet
4632118 we ran from here to the hospital and we went in and it was just room after room after room of children some were in wheelchairs bandaged others were lying on stretchers others were just simply huddled in the corner no parents god only knows what happened to them we worked our way through the crowd and at the bottom were our two children with their friend and my mother daughter was remarkably calm and lacerations the lacerations were confined really to her hairline from what we gathered she was obviously very distressed she bled quite profusely
4632119 he was crouched down against the wall with his head in his hands he told me that his wife was dead and his children were missing i covered him up with a sheet and put my arms around him but there was nothing else i could do there was also a young boy of about 11 or 12 strapped into a stretcher his hair was burnt and standing on end and he was deathly white he kept staring at me with huge frightened eyes that image will haunt me for ever
4632120 i stayed in ward five with a local lady doing what i could until she was air lifted to altnagelvin hospital in derry for further treatment
4632121 what chance have any of us got when we are told the bomb is at a courthouse when the actual target is the ordinary townspeople in a busy shopping area hundreds of yards away there can be no ifs or buts about this there are no so called legitimate targets there can be no excuse whatever for putting the lives of hundreds of people at risk such people serve no cause but that of murder and mayhem with the help of the decent people of northern ireland we will do everything in our power to ensure those responsible for this outrage are brought to justice
4632122 to be bold lads who ripped the heart out of omagh
4632123 at the end of the first week i actually was allowed access to one part of the building by the police it was under very special circumstances because the forensic had not finished their work it was quite late at night and it was into the nicholl amp shiels corner basically it was to assess the restaurant area above there were some very obvious structural cracks and that again is a memory that will always be with me as we walked through the building the rain was coming through the roof we scanned the torch it was a very very eerie feeling maybe 20 to 30 tables with lunches cups of coffee exactly the way they had been when the bomb went off and that particular building was packed at that stage and then you felt a stickiness on your feet and as i turned the torch down i realised i was walking on blood the whole way along the building so you can only imagine what it must have been like at the time for the people in there
4632124 all we want is that my youngsters and everybody elses youngsters it doesnt matter whether theyre catholic protestant hindu or whatever religion they are that they can go to school come home and their fathers and mothers are there and theyre not afraid that every time they walk down the street if someone drops a bin lid that its a bomb
4632125 i am totally horrifed by this action i condemn it without any equivocation whatsoever
4632126 it is a ghastly act a cruel act we will ruthlessly suppress those reponsible for the attack this is the most evil deed in years from our point of view we will continue to work in dealing with this particular group with the ruc and the gardai
4632127 this is an appalling act of savagery there is total determination to bring the perpetrators to justice but an equal determinatiion that they will not be allowed to destroy the process
4632128 the people who perpetrated the omagh bombing are addicted to violence and have no place in a civilised society
4632129 on behalf of every american i condemn this butchery and hope that the culprits will be brought to justice quickly i extend our deep sympathy to those affected by this tragedy i renew my pledge to stand with the people of northern ireland against the perpetrators of violence they will find no friends here
4632130 there must be decisive action to stop the terrorists who are committed to bringing death and destruction
4632131 the sort of people who would plant this device arent interested in anything other than murder i can only come to the conclusion that bloody murder was their intent
4632132 to bring such sadness and suffering to the people of omagh at this stage is a crime against humanity
4632133 it is clear that the people who carried out this terrible deed today are not only appalling murderers they are undiluted fascists
4632134 it was an indefensible action those responsible are aligning themselves with the forces opposed to a democratic settlement of the conflict here
4632135 i was shocked to hear of the appalling crime in omagh which resulted in so many deaths and injuries please pass on my heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved injured and those others who have suffered in their distress
4632136 it is the nio who spawned the process of buying off the terrorists and encouraging the gun
4632137 this atrocity would not have happened if the ira had handed over its weapons and explosives sinn fein cannot escape its responsibility in this bloody atrocity
4632138 this is the most horrific event in the history of northern ireland
4632139 i remember only too well feeling deeply angered when my great uncle lord mountbatten and other relations were blown to pieces nineteen years ago i remember so well feeling that so i can understand a little some of the feelings perhaps of those who lost their loved ones on this occasion
4632140 it is an attempt to excuse the inexcusable murder can never be excused or justified the people of northern ireland will treat the statement and its authors with the contempt they deserve
4632141 it is a pathetic attempt at an excuse for mass murder it is contemptable and it is an insult to the people of omagh
4632142 we are facing an enormous task requiring meticulous examination of literally tons of rubble this additional help represents a very significant increase in our ability to extract as quickly as humanly possible every last piece of evidence in what is a very complex jigsaw
4632143 these were the words of chief superintendent eric anderson when announcing the largest murder investigation ever in northern ireland in which specialists were called in from londons metropolitan police to assist the ruc
4632144 a number of similar bombs had been intercepted near the border in the preceding months sure enough the real ira admitted responsibility a few days after the bomb
4632145 we have a full team continually working on this investigation we have been working in close co operation with a number of other police forces we are pursuing a number of inquiries and it is likely that more arrests will follow but we still need help from the public
4632146 the fund will be used for the benefit of those who died or were injured as a result of the omagh bomb their relatives and dependants and those persons who have been adversely affected by the tragedy
4632147 please note that the customs stamp always has to be obtained when leaving the country
4632148 it serves as the proof of export and without the customs stamp we cannot pay anything

4632176 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4632177 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4632178 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4632179 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade

4632183 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
4632184 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
4632185 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

4632221 with mrs clinton scheduled to deliver a prime time speech in denver a state by state roll call vote increases her time in the convention spotlight
4632222 the former rivals never spoke directly about the matter but advisers said mr obama encouraged mrs clinton to agree to place her name into nomination as a nod to the historic nature of her candidacy
4632223 democratic sources said clinton who has been grappling with the best way to get her supporters on board has been mindful of being seen as a poor loser like sen ted kennedy d mass in 1980
4632224 finally this week clinton officials said they wanted clintons name to be in nomination obama personally had let his staff know that was fine with him democratic sources said
4632225 after having her name entered into nomination clinton could then ask her delegates to support obama bypassing the long process of reading names aloud
4632226 the tentative plan is for the states to announce the number of delegates for clinton and obama then for clinton to turn her delegates over to obama and cast her own superdelegate vote for him
4632227 in politics its always better to appear magnanimous than small petty disputes between candidates tend to turn off voters especially at the presidential level where voters expect the most of candidates
4632228 if the convention organizers can limit any public signs of disunity to a handful of disgruntled activists its likely that the average viewer wont even pick up on the protests
4632229 nevertheless pro clinton groups unaffiliated with the clinton campaign like people united means action and colorado women count women vote have said they will host parades and hand out fliers and promotional videos at the convention arguing that sen clinton is the stronger candidate to defeat sen mccain
4632230 russia rolls over georgia hillary clinton does the same to barack obama now we know whos boss
4632231 obama blinked and stands guilty of appeasing clinton by agreeing to a roll call vote for her nomination it was supposed to be his party now its theirs his and hers
4632232 were going to look at leadership specifically their character their competence their experience
4632233 many evangelicals think neither of these guys are i think both john mccain and barack obama and their relationship to jesus christ is their relationship but im going to give them a chance to explain themselves
4632234 it is a story unknown by a public still getting to know mccain and searching for shared values with the candidates
4632235 in an extended interview mccain talked about how his faith was tested during his years as a prisoner of war from 1967 to 1973 said god must have had a plan for him to have kept him alive and reminisced about his appointment as informal chaplain to his cellmates
4632236 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going

4632239 but stalin was evil why do you support him and all his ideological children
4632240 a world in which as many poor and near poor households as possible have permanent access to an appropriate range of high quality financial services including not just credit but also savings insurance and fund transfers
4632241 although the payment rate is very high in some microfinance institutions mfis most are not running efficiently
4632242 microfinance has been quite a disaster in china overall it never achieved a scale of sustainability
4632243 tianjin is a big city but the federation reached less than 2 000 clients after more than seven years
4632244 when it comes to providing financial services you need to have people who know how to take a commercial approach and who know how to be bankers
4632245 the better clients apply for rcc loans which are more favorable
4632246 before getting money from us they had to go to money lenders and the interest rate was quite high
4632247 while most microfinance programs have been funded by governments and donors efforts are now shifting to fostering commercial microfinance institutions
4632248 improving the environment for microfinance can also extend more credit to the rural poor
4632249 why did we get involved in this in the first place
4632250 its because the banks were not willing to lend to people without collateral and poor people in rural areas had no access to credit
4632251 we are trying to retrain loan officers to go out with a calculator and figure out what a micro entrepreneur can pay and to put less emphasis on the role of collateral
4632252 the client will say if im overdue the whole village will know
4632253 they manage money very well and they seldom go out to do migrant work or gamble or drink and getting a loan can change their position in the family and empower them
4632254 the challenge is to manage costs for relatively high volume small notional size loans
4632255 however there are models and institutions that make such a proposition commercially attractive and scalable
4632256 but there is a diverse history of very sustainable and even profitable microloan portfolios particularly in asia and latin america
4632257 and it thinks that microfinance is a good way to help
4632258 on their front page and who knows what else thaey call it ion other countries headlines

4632332 la cuesti n es muy simple se deben contemplar las diversas realidades regionales y generar un criterio equitativo y federal en la distribuci n de los subsidios esto que reclamamos mejorar sustancialmente la situaci n del transporte de pasajeros en el interior del pa s
4632333 fue una reuni n muy positiva en la cual qued en evidencia que todas las provincias est n en la misma situaci n que nosotros y por ello respaldan el reclamo
4632334 en la mesa todos coincidieron que es absolutamente desmedida la cifra que recibe el transporte en el rea metropolitana de buenos aires porque provoca que en el interior se cobren tarifas siempre superiores a las que se abonan all
4632335 esto se agrava porque buenos aires no s lo tiene el transporte de pasajeros mediante mnibus subsidiado sino tambi n el subte y el ferrocarril

4632337 normally ive had 14 weeks editing for any of my films so far six weeks for this film is crazy
4632338 i think they wanted to bring more of an emotional component to the movie
4632339 and they wanted to have the franchise go in a different direction last time they took a risk with having daniel craig in the film that was a success so this time they felt they could take it another step and see how it goes with another filmmaker

4632351 a search and rescue helicopter team has now returned the six missing australian climbers found in the metelille glacier area back to the mt cook village base the rescue coordination centre rcc new zealand said in a statement
4632352 all have been checked by medical staff and are well with no injuries
4632353 in the ever growing desire to produce smaller less costly yet more powerful and faster computers and storage devices researchers today said they are looking at a way to

4632355 we were able to land and get the climbers on board theyre now safely back at mt cook village to be checked out by medical staff theyre all ok
4632356 in 2002 there was an awful lot of confidence that the wind industry would be able to grow in scotland quite significantly and quite quickly
4632357 that gave confidence for a lot of positive investment decisions at the time from people like vestas they were hoping the industry would have a regular throughput of planning decisions that would lead to orders
4632358 as a government we are ready to do whatever we can to try and find a sustainable future for the yard
4632359 this monitoring mast will enable us to gather the data required to accurately assess whether the proposed bickerton hills site is sufficiently windy for a wind farm development
4632360 the information gathering process will take at least six months and during this period we will continue to work as closely as possible with local communities to highlight any progress that is made with our plans and to address any queries or concerns that are raised
4632361 only at the end of this period will we be able to assess if this particular site can be developed as a wind farm
4632362 energy produced from renewable sources has a central part to play in meeting the uks future energy requirements and we are certain that if the proposed bickerton hills scheme goes ahead it will bring a range of financial environmental and community benefits to the surrounding area
4632363 in our opinion their suggestion that the local community will benefit is very questionable and is not the common experience of communities which have turbines close to them
4632364 wed be very interested to know what help will be forthcoming for nearby residents whose quality of life will be impaired and whose homes will be devalued
4632365 this research has shown us once again that those of us who live in scotland really value our fantastic scenery and wildlife
4632366 wild land is an important aspect of the cultural identity of the park and it is clear from this study that the residents of the park value it greatly
4632367 the authority will work to ensure that wild land is enhanced and continues to contribute to the culture and economy of the park and wider region
4632368 we very much welcome this conformation that the vast majority of scotlands residents and visitors appreciate the importance of wild land

4632400 whiskey is for drinkin and water is for fightin over
4632401 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
4632402 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4632403 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4632404 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4632405 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4632406 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
4632407 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4632408 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4632409 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4632410 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4632411 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4632412 as sort of a clearing house for proper portfolios benchmarking
4632413 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4632414 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
4632415 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
4632416 for example if you start with 10 000 and then add 1 00 000 during a year there is a twr return calculation from the 10 000 contribution to the date the 1 000 000 was added then there is second calculation starting the day of the 1 000 000 contribution
4632417 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4632418 the whole point of calculating the portfolio twr is to remove the effect of cash flows on performance thereby making a comparison to a benchmark relevent the benchmark returns do not have any cash flows associated with them and neither does the portfolios twr so its an apples to apples comparison
4632419 i dont care its my life im entitled to live it in a suboptimal way
4632420 using the standard life cycle model we investigated the household retirement problem of
4632421 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4632422 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4632423 people have worked very hard to try get that programme up and running and maintain it there has also been a lack of support in a number of areas which im not going to go into here
4632424 it is devastating because everyone else playing here in beijing is a professional player unless new zealand can get our players into environments where they can play at a professional level its always going to be very difficult to come to the olympics and be competitive
4632425 in athens we were competitive because we had two superstars who were professionals we didnt have them this time we had a bunch of young kids trying to learn the game
4632426 since then theyve employed one of the best coaches in the world former tall ferns mentor tom maher had players in a programme getting daily involvement and being able to tour the world and play the best teams in the world
4632427 in new zealand we dont have the same resources as they have in china but weve got to try and replicate that type of development programme to be successful at an event like the olympics
4632428 hopefully a new zealand team gets put in next year but it wasnt unsettling
4632429 a lot of our players are in college like julia harmon jess mccormack and micaela cocks im sure the ones we need to keep for the next campaign will find a team
4632430 lisa wallbutton shes a hell of a player shell definitely find a team most of the other players are either going to get to play or are going to retire i know basketball new zealand and australia will work hard to make sure there is a new zealand team in the competition thats really important for the oceania region
4632431 we just have to go out in these sort of games and develop our own ability against the best players in the world
4632432 if you want to be the best youve got to play against the best
4632433 were looking forward to the opportunity but youve got to be realistic my bunch of kids with an average age of 22 are playing a bunch of seasoned professional players weve got to find some wins in it weve got to find other ways to win
4632434 youre playing the best players in the world and probably the best team along with australia its one of those things where youve just got to go out and give it your best shot
4632435 its not every day you get to play against players of that quality the majority of our players are young hopefully theyll see what the best players in the world do and what weve got to do to compete at that level
4632436 personally im looking forward to it its not every day i get to play against star us point guard sue bird

4632457 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4632458 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future

4632461 the russian forces had to operate in an environment of technical inferiority
4632462 given the posture of russian troops how could intelligence analysts have missed the possibility that the russians had laid a trap hoping for a georgian invasion to justify its own counterattack
4632463 the formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in pollution fueled by riverine runoff of fertilizers and the
4632464 from 1970 to 1990 the hypoxic zone on the northwestern of the black sea has expanded to 40 000 square kilometers 15 500 square miles
4632465 however since 1989 the loss of fertilizer subsidies from the former soviet union reduced nutrient loading by a factor of two to four with the result that by 1995 the hypoxic zone had gone
4632466 wir wollen mit der aktion ein zeichen gegen rechtsextremismus und f r demokratie und toleranz an der universit t in mainz setzten
4632467 wir wollen und wir m ssen gesellschaftliche zeichen setzen insbesondere dann wenn rechtliche normen nicht ausreichen
4632468 der verein hat aus diesem grund eine resolution entworfen f r deren unterst tzung er in den kommenden wochen werben wird die resolution ist im internet unter
4632469 die rechtlichen m glichkeiten sind in bezug auf rechtsextremismus eingeschr nkt aus diesem grund ist es umso wichtiger deutlich zu machen dass rechtsextremismus und nazismus in einer gesellschaft wie die hochschule eine ist nicht geduldet werden
4632470 wir wollen in den kommenden wochen um die unterst tzung dieser resolution werben und hoffen dass es uns gelingt auch m glichst viele unterst tzergruppen zu gewinnen
4632471 es w re selbstverst ndlich w nschenswert wenn auch die universit tsleitung und die studentischen beteiligungsgremien sich zu dieser resolution bekennen w rden und es uns gel nge hier eine erkl rung abzugeben die die interessen aller mitglieder der hochschule betrifft
4632472 man muss hierbei jedoch zwischen dem einzelfall und dem grundeproblem unterscheiden bez glich des inzwischen bekannten einzelfalls ist aus unserer sicht eine exmatrikulation anzustreben dar berhinaus gibt es aber auch wie in jeder gr eren gesellschaft ein grunds tzliches problem mit rechtsextremismus hiergegen richtet sich die resolution die mainzer universit t ist weltoffen und tolerant und das soll auch so bleiben
4632473 das problem wird nicht dadurch kleiner dass man es leugnet oder kleinredet man muss offensiv gegen rechtsextremismus angehen
4632474 i think that the reason most of us are in the business is for peoples safety

4632500 the inks used are water based and the finishing process is done with heat and pressure instead of harsh chemicals the digital printing process in general is actually very eco friendly there is little to no water and fabric waste where as the traditional rotary screen printing process can waste thousands upon thousands of gallons of water for each run
4632501 if the attorney general tenders a certification and the district court dismisses the case under the new fisaaa provisions there will be no need for this court to resolve the pending appeals which would thus become moot

4632503 i begin to understand why herzog likes it here the exhibits in the museum cross the line between fact and fiction between reality and imagination
4632504 i cant answer that i have no idea because i didnt grow up in that world
4632505 i would never in a million years see me doing something like that and i still dont
4632506 just the whole idea of being a judge i find distasteful in a way
4632507 i think at this point also the fact of the matter is that most people doing that show in any country anywhere youd be hard pressed to find someone going into it not really knowing what they are getting into theyd have to be pretty naive
4632508 i know some of these kids have gone through the mill
4632509 i dont suppose its any different really from the old days when you signed a big record deal it was the same kind of pressure and expectations you were the bait in the shark infested seas i recall that sensation myself you have to have a profound love of the medium of the art to put up with the bollocks surrounding it
4632510 its a free for all a free bashing for all with the internet blogging and also instant photographs the whole culture is kind of i think the last days of rome

4632514 im like whoa whoa whoa back up what do you mean i have the part i dont want the part but it was too late i couldnt get out because i said yes fly me down i never thought i was going to get the goddamn thing
4632515 the irony of if is that i ended up very much appreciating her as a character as an artist and how unusual she was
4632516 i developed a grudging admiration for her and my god the role was hard that was the hardest thing ive ever done it was brutal it was the most frightened id ever been i had to act i had to talk i was doing 19 songs by el screecho a night and all these costume changes it was petrifying
4632517 i didnt have commercial expectations for get what you give i havent in years and years if you sell one cd youre doing great
4632518 i make records for myself and for my fans people who really really enjoy what i do im lucky enough to be able to indulge myself doing something that i truly adore
4632519 its unbelievably cool and its so exciting to know thats happening in canada
4632520 i know people who are real actors im a hack but when i act i just pretend that im somebody else i know thats what youre supposed to do but people go to f g school to study this stuff
4632521 i didnt go to school for music either but ive been involved in music for so long that to me ive been to the school of music in real life
4632522 im a firm believer that children are here with their own agenda your job is to do the bloody best you can guiding and aiding and abetting when they are young and then they decide it is entirely up to them
4632523 if either of them wanted to follow me in music and i can help them in any way i absolutely will if they want to be scientists even more exciting because i dont know anything about that

4632526 theres a better way better for the power switch and for the circuitry inside the computer instead of turning off the power switch and exchanging the program disks do this choose the applications quit option but dont turn off the computers power push in on the disk drive eject button remove the last application program disk you were using and insert the one you want to use next hold down the apple key and control while you press reset then release all three keys starting with reset if it seems awkward youre doing it right if it were more convenient you might press the keys by accident and restart your application losing everything stored in memory up to that point
4632527 guerra de los e mails un debate virtual qu sentiste al ver que esta gente buscaba una suerte de reparaci n hist rica
4632528 at this time of the year at 12 0 where were trying to get to what we want to achieve later on in the season it just cant happen
4632529 two weeks ago we played canberra here and i thought i performance was good
4632530 on a positive note its probably good its happened tonight because we can address it leading into the next few games
4632531 it was a big night for locky lockyer but i was happy to spoil his party
4632532 you can have all the wheels you like but it doesnt matter unless the guys in the middle get it done
4632533 i dont know where that what came from to be honest with you
4632534 the penalty had been completed and everything else and they blow a penalty for being offside
4632535 if youre offside youre offside it should have been called long before he made the tackle
4632536 he puts the guys on the ground and all of a sudden hes offside
4632537 typo3 in den google serps wohl auf platz vier geschafft hat daveshap havent seen google serps this volatile in a long time
4632538 we gave the ball away too easily at stages but weve got a lot of boys missing so im very happy under the circumstances
4632539 i thought adrian caceres had a great game and was always threatening down the left hand side
4632540 it was backs to the wall stuff and we nearly nicked it in the end
4632541 we took the wrong options at times especially in the final third but it was a game i thought we dominated especially with possession
4632542 its his ankle thats the problem so its going to be a couple of weeks at least if not worse
4632543 thats not good news for us hell have a scan tomorrow and see how he goes
4632544 we competed pretty well but their execution in these conditions under pressure was excellent they do it so well
4632545 it was a good performance especially the first half its hard to be critical of too much we did
4632546 any player that has seven centre clearances by halftime then youre in trouble
4632547 we threw three or four different combinations at him after halftime we were able to rein it in he had two in the third or none in the last either he got sick of getting it or we did something reasonably well
4632548 i thought we got quite a good response from our players from last weeks disappointing game
4632549 to go inside 50m the same amount of times win the hard ball gets and the clearances shots on goal were pretty similar
4632550 a lot of their goals we kicked it straight to them
4632551 the deployment of new antimissile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4632552 we told the world this is about starting an invasion
4632553 this is not an agreement about the future of abkhazia and south ossetia this is about getting russian troops out

4632562 it really depends on your car some engines can and some engines cant the debate is based upon reality that it depends on your car its sensors and its ability to adapt
4632563 please dont do it or go back and ask the manufacturer because its probably not good for it
4632564 can compete with gasoline and that was even before gas prices spiked so yes its expensive but gas isnt cheap anymore either

4632602 unang una pagkatapos ng eksena nag sorry ako agad nag sorry ako kasi kung tutuusin dapat talaga yun kung meron man sa boyfiend or asawa di ba pero hindi e para sa akin e nag sorry ako sa kanya so tapos sabi niya okey lang naintindihan ko pero ako yung nahihiya para sa kanya kasi unang una kumbaga ginusto niya dahil sa trabaho rin kailangan trabaho talaga walang personalan pero medyo na guilty ng konti
4632603 hindi masarap kasi pinagkatiwalaan ako ng tao na ibinigay sa akin ang first kiss sobrang suwerte talaga
4632604 sa akin naman po medyo sa kanya naging uneasy sa una kasi ten seconds lumapat pero eksena lang yun wala talaga yun
4632605 at malamang masusundan talaga kasi sa trabaho namin at kailangan talaga
4632606 si mel hindi naman siya sobrang masarap siyang kasama type ko si mel oo
4632607 oo naman pero hindi naman sa kinalimutan magkaibigan pa rin kami
4632608 oo dati pero ngayon kasi kumbaga both sides na rin kaya okay na e kaya hindi na namin pinag uusapan
4632609 nung nalaman niya na break na kami ni olyn hindi naman siya nagtatanong gaano yung ganun kumbaga normal lang kung ano talaga yung ginagawa namin sa pang araw araw
4632610 hindi ano kasi busy din ako e busy sa trabaho lack of time nag usap na lang kami na ano muna cool off lie low tapos yun na totally breakup

4632614 hahanapin ko talaga siya kasi yung tao napakabait sa akin at ang tagal na naming magkasama so maninibago talaga ako kapag hindi ko siya nakasama
4632615 ngayon nga lang kapag hindi kami magkasama hinahanap din namin ang isat isa kumbaga kumustahan text text yung ganun or minsan sabay kaming nagpa facial hindi kasi yung sponsor namin iisa lang so kapag minsan mauuna ako sa kanya doon minsan kasi nagpa facial na siya
4632616 siguro kung may hinu hold man ako sa akin na yon
4632617 i have two young children whom i love watching as they sing along and dance to their childrens cds
4632618 also i learned that in school they are taught both english and tagalog childrens and folk songs
4632619 so kiko sen francis pangilinan her husband and i while watching them just thought it would be great to do this album while they are young pa and i can still appreciate this collection it is also for all my fans who have grown up with me and who are also mommies and daddies now
4632620 another important goal for me is to be able to share our kind of music with pinoy children all over the world who didnt grow up here and therefore know so little of our very own folk songs and who will also hopefully appreciate the numbers in english
4632621 we are all excited over this a first in the philippine music industry and i am so proud and excited and i again wish to thank my sony bmg family for making this dream come true and for getting excited over it as well
4632622 inaayos na namin ng sonybmg ang album and very soon ilu launch na namin ito excited na ako talaga

4632625 the book is aimed at the consumer and it is written in a simple entertaining style such that the consumer will understand it and enjoy reading it
4632626 im looking forward to competing at caraway because its a new track and will present plenty of challenges
4632627 my dad speed channel television commentator bob tells me it has long straight a ways and tight corners so im hoping to use my experience from some other tracks to help me run well there
4632628 i think our north region will put on a fun race for the fans to watch it was long straight a ways and tight corners and that style of racetrack provides some of the best racing for pro challenge clint king has been tough this year but i know a lot of other drivers are catching up to him quickly and this may be their opportunity to beat him i appreciate that the folks from pass welcomed us in at such late notice
4632629 traditional families a mom a dad a son a daughter and their pet of choice thats how it should be
4632630 this is a great opportunity for me knowing the success rate of drivers who have come out of the nine racing program like tony stewart jason leffler and other famous drivers
4632631 for me just to have the chance to drive the 9 midget of nine racing is an awesome deal
4632632 dave darland has been an integral component in nine racings success since joining the team on a regular basis in 1999 accounting for the most wins by one driver for our team with 25
4632633 dave is a genuine usac style racing icon and we truly appreciate his contribution to our team however at this time we are taking the team in a new direction with darren who joins kody swanson for the remainder of the season
4632634 i dont know where its going to end up but we picked up almost a half second actually more than a half second from practice and the car felt really good dan stillman crew chief made some really good changes we sat down and talked about it we unloaded good we didnt do qualifying trim as well as we wanted to but the principal financial group chevy was good there and hopefully we can keep on going with it all weekend its been a learning experience for everybody dan is a rookie crew chief at this level im a raybestos rookie at this level and were starting to get our communication down we went and did a test this past week that really helped out just to get everybody off and go do a test on our own and check out some stuff and figure some stuff out all in all it was a good lap and hopefully itll be good sunday
4632635 yeah sometimes its good for you to sit out for a week i guess that was a good lap dan and all the guys on the principal financial group chevy did a good job we changed a lot after practice and picked up a lot after practice and it was good we sat down and looked at everything and he came up with a plan props to the team and hopefully we can carry it through sunday
4632636 making sure it drives like that all day sunday smiles
4632637 hopefully all the qualifying gets in i dont think theres supposed to be any rain but definitely thatll put us a lot better than 35th or 34th or whatever were at in points im just looking forward to this weekend been looking forward to it for a long time the mobil 1 dodge was real good when we were here for the june race and we expected that we felt like we made the car race a lot better since then even and with the run that we had here last time we feel like we ought to be able to go forward from that even there so many things that are advantageous about starting up front obviously first off is starting up front and secondly you have a better pit spot the guys are all pumped up and motivated to go just a lot of little things as far as giving yourself small breaks to be able to go forward
4632638 its pretty good i guess youve got to learn how to qualify in that situation but the guys did a good job i was a little loose this morning tight there and we fixed it all up and we were a little bit lucky the cloud was right above when we qualified a great job by the guys weve got tow truck in a box this weekend and hopefully were starting in the top 10 so im happy good improvement
4632639 i dont know if it helps the learning curve but it certainly helps to stay on the lead lap and thats what we want here smiles last time we stayed there until the crash at the end of the race so hopefully well get a good race car but im looking forward to this one i like this track
4632640 you know i really wish id know because they havent told me we talked and they said we need a little bit more time so i said thats fine were going to start talking to other teams too and other guys i know a couple of teams talked to robert and well see what happens i like this team id like to stay there i think the no 10 is getting better and better and the guys do such a great job for me id be disappointed not to keep going on the work that weve been doing so hopefully it works well for us and im right here where im at for next year
4632641 for me i would have signed myself in january for three years laughs well see you know its their decision and im pretty confident its going to stay the way it is i know a few sponsors seems to want to get back and weve got most of the season for next year so were waiting on a few things but if it works out well be there they told me its looking good right here they said just be patient we need to change a few things around and then were going to let you know but its most likely going to be positive so hopefully thats what it is and they said if not theyll let me know so well see what it is
4632642 i love it its great but for me my kids are born in the u s so theyre american so its a mix of half and half in the family and were both canadian and u s citizens its great for me every time they play it i think there are so many canadians out here its amazing even at loudon there must have been 30 000 canadians up there so its great i remember when i was in indy cars they played it i dont know must be a canadian that owns that track laughs
4632643 yeah for me i would have put the deadline on january 15 laughs i guess we talked a couple of weeks ago in montreal and decided to extend it a little bit so well see how it goes i know the team wants to move some stuff around and they got things to do im fairly confident from what they tell me theyre looking forward to it and hopefully im back in the same seat because we work really hard with that no 10 car and with the guys ive got a great group of guys working on the car and i dont want to loose these guys so hopefully im back in the same place but within the next few weeks they said they would tell me so i dont decide for the day i just kind of wait and if they say yes ill be a real happy guy and if they say no they well see what else we have we can talk to other teams now we are going to start this weekend were going to start doing that i now a couple of teams came to see robert he works with me so were going to talk with these guys too and see what happens but i really hope im back in that seat because i think weve built a lot of stuff and were getting better and better and were stating to know each other more and more and i think in this series all the little details counts if i could stay there i think its going to help
4632644 i cannot say they asked me not to say but theyre going to do a lot of shuffling around moving around and i dont know what that means if its with people or sponsors or what it is but i know theyre working on a lot of stuff i guess they want to see also when i get back to tracks a second time so we had a good qualifying here so its pretty good but i dont know honestly im not in there secrets so i hope they do that for me id like to stay because i had a team a while back in formula atlantic was lynx racing and it really felt like family and to me this team is truly the same way it was when i was in formula atlantic the only problem that ive got is with elliott laughs and thats just because he came in these guys and elliott help me and every time before qualifying it helps me so much so i really hope that im back there
4632645 weve come a long way since last year and we still have a lot of harder work ahead of us to get to the front
4632646 when we unloaded the car it was just awesome right out of the gate it handled and had such good grip sometimes you just hit it right combination you dont know why if you did you could do it every week
4632647 that is a great team the team to beat in our sport
4632648 and to lay down a lap like that was great i thought it would be tough to post a 38 40 second lap and then to get a 38 189 was just great with this new car you dont have to make as many changes as you had to in the past but the track will go through changes the car will have to be adjusted and while the pole is great what you shoot for is what you do at the end of the day on sunday
4632649 it didnt really shock me that much because hes more of a guy who ran up front the majority of the race here last june
4632650 i think that team and brian this is a track that fits their style
4632651 i knew mine wasnt the perfect lap from inside the car the car was much tighter than it needed to be and i was shocked to hear the lap time when i got back to the start finish line it wasnt all that bad but i knew someone could go better and i knew vickers was strong throughout the entire practice and sure enough he put up a big number
4632652 there definitely was a lot of momentum at jtg daugherty racing this week
4632653 everyone was on cloud nine it wont change the way we approach this saturdays race the two mile tracks have been our strong suit all year were going there with a game plan to run in the top 10 all day and put ourselves in position at the end
4632654 now that marcos has a win everyone on this clorox team is eager to get a win too now that we have the momentum its important that we keep it as an organization
4632655 were taking our las vegas darlington car we were running in the top 10 at both places we had to hold kelly back a little bit on the road courses because he had very limited experience we came out of the road courses in good shape now its time to turn him loose
4632656 we hit on something at kansas last year with this new generation car and weve been working to make it better every week since
4632657 weve taken all the notes from the end of last year and the beginning of this year and weve been really good at the mile and a half and the two mile tracks
4632658 were still getting better week in and week out were getting a game plan together for next year so we can get off to a good start if we do everything right and the car is fast off the hauler we pretty should be a top 10 car everywhere we go

4632661 im really looking forward to making my first sprint car start at williams grove speedway in next weeks ollies 360 challenge finale
4632662 williams grove is a track that has been such a historic part of sprint car racing its a place where all drivers want to compete during their careers ive driven a modified at williams grove before but im excited to compete there in the sprint car were very proud to have been part of these three events with a partner such as ollies bargain outlets next weeks race will be a great event both for the fans and the drivers and im looking forward to getting back in the old spice sprint car against some of the greatest winged sprint car drivers in the country
4632663 i was looking forward to racing against donny again next week and its unfortunate that he wont be able to compete at williams grove with us hes been on a roll the past few months and it was great to watch him and the no 15 armor all team win their third straight knoxville nationals title last weekend as a car owner nothing would have made me prouder than to see him win at williams grove and earn the 50 000 bonus as a driver i really enjoy competing against him it would have been fun to have him compete with us in the ollies 360 challenge finale next week
4632664 its great to work with the kasey kahne foundation again this year
4632665 the race not only gives me a chance to get back in my 360 sprint car but it benefits a great organization at the same time kasey has always supported my charity events at eldora speedway and it means a lot that hes invited me to participate in this race alongside him hopefully well be able to put on a great show for the fans and help out a lot of deserving kids
4632666 it was a great lap for our stanley dodge i left a lot on the table i screwed up pretty bad in turns 1 and 2 my guys did a great job and gave me a great racecar ive been fast all day were racing for one million bucks this weekend so to start up front is a great sign of how sunday may shape up its a great racecar the same car we had at indy its just in the race track and responds well i think we have a really good piece for sunday the hotter and slicker it the track gets the better well get
4632667 stanley tools along with ace hardware foundation are donating 1 million to the childrens miracle network if were able to win the race this weekend its an unbelievable incentive we went to the sparrow hospital in lansing michigan yesterday and met some amazing kids who gave us that much more incentive to win the race
4632668 the car is pretty good the tow truck in a box dodge guys did a great job preparing the car i was a little loose this morning and the guys fixed it up i was a little lucky that a cloud was right above when we went out to qualify im really happy a good improvement for sure
4632669 it was a good lap for our jim beam dodge i just had to check up in turn 2 and that probably cost me a tenth of a second i just had to roll out of the throttle a bit and lost some time i happy with what my guys are doing with the car and it showed today its just not our road race program its the ovals too
4632670 we ran the same lap time speed that we ran in practice the handling characteristics and lap time we made some changes but just couldnt get the tightness out of the car in turn 2 that killed our speed down the back straightaway overall it was a good practice day for race trim and qualifying trim this car in general if you have it figured out like my little brother kyle busch does and some of the other teams you stay hot thats what i said all along with this new car hopefully were climbing up the right hill that will help us get hot
4632671 we made some changes after practice and they seemed to work quite a bit we feel pretty good about our racecar and think we should be pretty competitive the changes that we made during practice in race trim translated to some good lap times and thats a positive sign well keep wrenching on it tomorrow and try to get it faster for sunday
4632672 it was a good lap for our texaco havoline dodge i got tight in turn 1 and had to get out of the gas coming out of the corner the car was really good i think we should have run at least a 40 30 40 seconds when i saw brian vickers run a 18 30 18 seconds i really wanted to go for it were starting to run better every week and getting chances at winning poles positions i dont want to get out of the car knowing that i left anything out there on the track
4632673 it was a decent lap obviously were going to be about four tenths off the pole the car drove all right i wish we had the primary engine in the car for two laps i would say it wasnt horrible it was a decent effort for us a good effort by the guys changing the engine and a decent effort as for as overall speed
4632674 that will put us a lot better than where we are in points 34th in owner points ive been looking forward to this weekend for a long time the mobil 1 dodge drove good when we were here for the june race and weve made the racecar a lot better since then with the run we had here the last time we feel like we should be able to go forward ive never won here in anything were looking to changing that somewhere down the road and i couldnt think of a better place to get our first win in sprint cup than here
4632675 it was an ok lap we made some changes before qualifying and that seemed to make our target dodge a little bit happier i wish that i could go back out there because i think that we had some more left in it we were loose coming to the green and a little snug coming to the checkered flag we were fighting a double edged sword we made three or four changes to the good and probably needed one more to get the car just right ill take it
4632676 not really because fuel mileage usually doesnt play a factor until the last pit stop you push the car hard all day and if a caution comes late in the race and you have to play the fuel mileage game then you just adjust as the race goes on
4632677 i was the first car out and here at michigan thats not the qualifying spot you want at all our betty crocker dodge felt pretty good the track was a little bit hotter than we would have liked but thats the luck of the draw weve got some things to work on tomorrow to try and get a little bit quicker well get working on it
4632678 i cant believe he did it this is amazing im so happy i can only jump up and down
4632679 the first thing i thought of was my parents and my coach
4632680 we are proud descendants of the great ghengis khan and tuvshee proved the strength of mongolians in the olympics
4632681 it is so exciting that our mongolian flag was raised in beijing and tuvshee won in the judo competition
4632682 me and several of my friends have bought mongolian vodka to celebrate this wonderful news it is going to be a very exciting night
4632683 right after the june 29 election we were in central square protesting election results and throwing stones against policemen and interior troops this time we are all here to cheer and support our athletes participating in beijing olympics
4632684 the authors ignore contrary evidence cherry pick and manipulate supporting evidence and evade inconvenient questions
4632685 they published a sampling methodology that can overestimate deaths by a wide margin but respond to criticism by claiming that they did not actually follow the procedures that they stated
4632686 could 650 000 iraqis really have died because of the invasion
4632687 could men really have landed on the moon in 1969
4632688 could humans as opposed to aliens really have built the pyramids 5000 years ago
4632689 could human beings ever have evolved from single celled organisms as darwin proposed
4632690 several academics have tried to find out how the lancet study was conducted none regards their queries as having been addressed satisfactorily
4632691 it is likely that many if not most civilian casualties will go unreported by the media that is the sad nature of war
4632692 london times hatchet job on last shreds on lambert credibility
4632693 apparently roberts also made a statement about the 2004 study that was misunderstood to refer to the 2006 study correcting a misunderstanding is not the same as making a retraction
4632694 recently iraqi casualty data from the multi national corps iraq mnc i significant activities database were released 5 these data estimated the civilian casuality sic rate at 117 deaths per day between may 2005 and june 2006 on the basis of deaths that occurred in events to which the coalition responded
4632695 these dod data estimated the civilian casuality rate at 117 deaths per day between may 2005 and june 2006
4632696 the best known is the iraq body count which estimated that up to september 26 2006 between 43 491 and 48 283 iraqis have been killed since the invasion
4632697 estimates from the iraqi ministry of the interior were 75 higher than those based on the iraq body count from the same period
4632698 estimates for civilian casualties from the iraqi ministry of the interior were 75 percent higher than those of our iraq body count based estimate over the aggregate may 2003 december 2005 period
4632699 most definitely but to acknowledge the fact that our western governments are criminal entities is taboo hence why the times and most of the other western msm sources have either downplayed or attacked the conclusions of the lancet study
4632700 certainly an important problem for many surveys not only the iraq lancet one
4632701 im sure that you are correct and that many people are simply dismissing msb out of hand but i dont believe many professionals do i do however believe that for this particular situation many professionals dismiss an overall bias factor of 3
4632702 joe emersberger from canada who follows this issue closely collected some of the expert criticisms of the report and a selection was put to mr roberts
4632703 why do you think he would say something different to nature than he would say to the bbc in response to the same question
4632704 the timing issues do seem a bit odd as others have suggested
4632705 the interviews could never have been carried out in the stated times
4632706 respondents were also asked to describe the composition of their household on jan 1 2002 and asked about any births deaths or visitors who stayed in the household for more than 2 months periods of visitation and individual periods of residence since a birth or before a death were recorded to the nearest month interviewers asked about any discrepancies between the 2002 and 2004 household compositions not accounted for by reported births and deaths when deaths occurred the date cause and circumstances of violent deaths were recorded
4632707 sampling followed the same approach used in 2004 except that selection of survey sites was by random numbers
4632708 it took about twice as long as some studies i did elsewhere
4632709 the time required for these tasks should not be significantly shortened by the authors use of
4632710 if they were performing this on a doorstep they would not have been able to ensure even to the limited degree they did that the participants were being honest
4632711 gosh it seems to me sitting in front of my dell in a nice safe warm building that those assholes over there didnt have enough time to do this survey even though ive never conducted a survey particularly one in iraq
4632712 why is everyone having to speculate on issues which are fairly fundamental to assessing the study
4632713 hounding a man with downright silly questions is no way to persuade him to be more forthcoming
4632714 exactly how many members composed your household jan 1 2004
4632715 i suspect that faced with a difficult and dangerous task they simply made many of the interviews up
4632716 they could not have done the surveys in the stated time
4632717 hounding a man with downright silly questions is no way to persuade him to be more forthcoming
4632718 survey could not have been carried out in the stated times
4632719 the more of les roberts statements i read the less impressed i am with his general credibility he is a biased and vitriolic debater
4632720 the surveys could not have been carried out in the stated time
4632721 i suspect that faced with a difficult and dangerous task they simply made many of the interviews up
4632722 lengthy explanations of the purposes of the survey and that it would help the iraqi people were necessary to allay fears
4632723 it seems to me that the the death rate in iraq massively increased as a result of the war
4632724 well if anyone disagrees with me i havent run into them
4632725 robert shone its time for you to take a little step back and calm down
4632726 iraqi politics is now dominated by islamicist parties shiite and sunni
4632727 so the relevant probabilities for f are for the times when folks are outside the home
4632728 hence a reasonable estimate for fo is not 15 16 but 2 16
4632729 if you pick a very small number of main streets you can get n 10 but no one who was trying to sample from all households would pick such a small set
4632730 the msb authors expect us to believe that riyadh lafta while trying to make sure that all households could be sampled came up with a scheme that excluded 91
4632731 the survey sample of 300 violent deaths from march 2003 to july 2006 page 7 of the survey is extrapolated to approximately 600 000 for the country as a whole of the 300 violent deaths 30 10 were the result of car bombs in the year june 2005 june 2006 using the surveys methodology i believe that equates to 60 000 people killed by car bombs in one year the most recent data available on the iraq body count website lists 15 car bombs in the first half of september ignoring bombs which targeted non iraqi forces taking the highest figure for reported deaths these bombs killed 75 people thats an average of 5 people killed per car bomb on that basis 60 000 deaths would require 12 000 car bombs in one year or 33 per day either that or there are hundreds of massive car bombs killing hundreds of people which are going totally unreported
4632732 ive never seen such crass credentialism as your posts consistently express
4632733 we had eight interviewers working ten hour days for 49 days they had two hours in the field to ask each household five questions they had time
4632734 its hard to get reliable figures for car bomb fatalities because most of them happen in places where nobody is counting
4632735 lancets estimate corresponds to about 20 car bombs per day all but one or two of which fail to be reported by the media yet car bombs fall well within the earlier mentioned category of incidents which average 6 unique reports on them
4632736 most disturbing and certain about the results is that more than 80 percent of violent deaths were caused by u s forces
4632737 you know the most amazing thing happened to me tonight i was coming here on the way to the lecture and i came in through the parking lot and you wont believe what happened i saw a car with the license plate arw 357 can you imagine of all the millions of license plates in the state what was the chance that i would see that particular one tonight amazing
4632738 i dont know where you got that from but les roberts says quite the opposite here
4632739 what you write is pretty typical straw man and sophistry
4632740 youre trying to say that since the car bombs statistic is improbable under the hypothesis that the survey was carried out properly it is therefore probably not the case that the survey was carried out properly
4632741 the main problem with joshs line of argument is that while an argument from probability may cast doubt on a particular survey finding it can not rule it out
4632742 whites at princeton it often seems as if to them she will always be black first
4632743 by actually working with the black lower class or within their communities as a result of their ideologies a separationist may better understand the desperation of their situation and feel more hopeless about a resolution as opposed to an integrationist who is ignorant to their plight
4632744 further integration and or assimilation into a white cultural and social structure that will only allow me to remain on the periphery of society never becoming a full participant
4632745 there was no doubt in my mind that as a member of the black community i am obligated to this community and will utilize all of my present and future resources to benefit the black community first and foremost
4632746 predominately white universities like princeton are socially and academically designed to cater to the needs of the white students comprising the bulk of their enrollments
4632747 i hoped that these findings would help me conclude that despite the high degree of identification with whites as a result of the educational and occupational path that black princeton alumni follow the alumni would still maintain a certain level of identification with the black community however these findings do not support this possibility
4632748 wow what a great show of american pride and spirit
4632749 cheguei conclus o que de manh s estou bem na caminha
4632750 not only are we co presenting two significant events back to back but were also sponsoring the retailers lounge room key program and the vice party at asr and our first nationwide commercial is currently running hot and heavy on fuel tv as well allyance has come a long way in a year and were aiming to cap it off with a bangin month of activity

4632756 the time for conversations has passed the time for concrete action has come
4632757 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4632758 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles a year
4632759 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4632760 they dont have a choice to believe us we have a body
4632761 neither of the grounds put forward by the district court grounds which have been loosely characterized as government deception and outrageous conduct supports the drastic remedy of dismissal of the indictment
4632762 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected
4632763 para mim n o h o menor problema que as for as federais venham ao rio nos ajudar se o governo tiver que ser a autoridade a solicit las eu oficializo agora essa solicita o j disse ao presidente do tse que o meu desejo que venham

4632767 desde el primer minuto en el micr fono todas las dudas desaparecieron roger se ha metido tanto en la piel de piaf que no se pueden ver las costuras su voz es como la de la artista que encarna profunda y amarga e irresistible durante dos horas ella es piaf
4632768 these startling figures show that the government is building a national dna database by stealth there can be no excuse for storing the dna of innocent adults let alone children who are entirely blameless
4632769 i cant believe we are where we are in the points to be honest with you
4632770 if it werent for us having an awesome team we wouldnt be where we are as a team we know weve got to get the cars running better too
4632771 its uncharacteristic for jeff to be in this position for this long
4632772 there is no doubt that he has had a challenging season
4632773 those guys are extremely dedicated to getting it right and they will
4632774 in this sport its never any fun if youre not winning
4632775 its been a great year and we could never really ask for more
4632776 but you hope that the success can continue and you can hope that you can have a shot for the championship when its all said and done
4632777 but youve got to have a good time while being there just being able to have the opportunity to be here is of course a dream come true for myself though its always been more fun to win
4632778 i wouldnt have moved to a team that i didnt think that they could have the same success i had at hendrick motorsports
4632779 but this much no you couldnt have thought of that but its definitely been a lot of fun
4632780 it would just escalate our point total for the start of the chase and give us a little bit easier time throughout the chase realistically though its going to be harder than it looks
4632781 its going to be pretty tough to beat jimmie johnson carl edwards and of course greg biffle is good here and matts kenseth good here
4632782 you know obviously were working really hard to keep scott in the top 35 right now and that would ensure that ryan doesnt have to do what he does best thats going out and getting front rows and poles and everything
4632783 were trying to work really hard the rest of the season to accomplish that so we dont put that pressure on ryan
4632784 thats something thats really big to the organization right now that we do everything we can to keep that 66 car in the top 35 in points let newman worry about going out and racing not worrying about going out and qualifying the first five weeks
4632785 id say were at about a c plus level as far as our on track performance
4632786 were good enough to make the chase based on how weve run week to week
4632787 if we just have another top 10 run like we ran last week eighth at watkins glen and do what we have to do well race them once we get into the chase
4632788 we just need to make sure we dont have to rely on racing our way in that last race because you never know what can happen
4632789 in a short track you can get caught up doing just about anything weve got to play it safe right now
4632790 be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them and the point is to live everything live the questions now perhaps you will then gradually without noticing it live along some distant day into the answer

4632796 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4632797 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4632798 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4632799 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4632800 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4632801 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4632802 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4632803 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4632804 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4632805 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4632806 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4632807 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4632808 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4632809 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4632810 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4632811 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4632812 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4632813 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4632814 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4632815 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4632816 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4632817 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4632818 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4632819 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4632820 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4632821 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4632822 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4632823 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4632824 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4632825 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4632826 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4632827 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4632828 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4632829 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4632830 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4632831 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4632832 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4632833 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4632834 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4632835 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4632836 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4632837 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4632838 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4632839 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4632840 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4632841 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4632842 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4632843 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4632844 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4632845 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4632846 this is a planning took where all things are going
4632847 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4632848 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4632849 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4632850 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4632851 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4632852 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4632853 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4632854 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4632855 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4632856 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4632857 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4632858 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4632859 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4632860 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4632861 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4632862 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4632863 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4632864 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4632865 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4632866 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4632867 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4632868 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4632869 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4632870 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4632871 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4632872 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4632873 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4632874 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4632875 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4632876 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4632877 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4632878 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4632879 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4632880 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4632881 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4632882 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4632883 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4632884 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4632885 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4632886 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4632887 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4632888 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4632889 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4632890 estou trabalhando todos os dias agora estou em frente a um piano este meu melhor trabalho
4632891 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4632892 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4632893 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4632894 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4632895 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4632896 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4632897 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4632898 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4632899 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4632900 w hat do you want to bet that a lot of those wealthy liberals have funny last names
4632901 and what do you want to bet that a lot of those wealthy liberals have funny last names
4632902 we are not rooting for either candidate were rooting for white people
4632903 and what do you want to bet that a lot of those wealthy liberals have funny last names
4632904 and notice that no one ever refutes anything ive written they cant but they hate the fact that im telling the truth on my blog and on the radio show so because they cant refute me they simply resort to name calling
4632905 jailed by an austrian court after pleading guilty to denying that the holocaust took place
4632906 heartily endorse s and accept s as our own the founding tenets of the post responding to how his
4632907 we are not rooting for either candidate were rooting for white people
4632908 between mccain and obama we couldnt care less who wins in fact we think an obama victory would be fitting the only countries in the world that have black heads of state are third world countries and as massive demographic changes in this country will soon make much of america a third world country a black president would be entirely appropriate
4632909 w hat do you want to bet that a lot of those wealthy liberals have funny last names
4632910 i think well have to see if i can play regularly i dont see why i shouldnt be able to play in all the games the proof will be in the pudding but hopefully ill be fine
4632911 i think ill be fit now but ive had to do things a bit different this pre season
4632912 ive not really played as many pre season games as id have liked or would normally do but ive done a lot of individual work and ill definitely be fit for the start of the season
4632913 there are 30 million of us in california and we have tens of thousands of volunteers working for obama
4632914 our goal of going to invesco was to get as many residents of colorado into the arena to see the speech because this is a battleground state
4632915 having that event here gives us the opportunity for obama to take that message to them in their own backyards
4632916 its like starting the baseball game with five runs up on the board already
4632917 we are going to keep banging on the door you never want to allow the biggest state to be disappointed
4632918 another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
4632919 speaker pelosi and the democrat controlled congress have presided over an historic rise in gas prices and their refusal to address this crisis has made matters even worse for american families small businesses seniors and schools
4632920 if speaker pelosi and her democratic colleagues were truly serious about increasing production of american energy and lowering the price of gasoline they would call congress back into session immediately to vote on our all of the above energy plan rather than taking a five week break away from washington
4632921 house republicans unprecedented nationwide gas prices protest enters its third full week on monday and our message of more american made energy and lower gas prices is clearly resonating with the american people we will not relent until we secure a vote on the american energy act
4632922 itd probably be good to have a couple around for spares
4632923 the bottom line is that youre getting rid of the stuff
4632924 most cities are strange in the sense that periodically we have very unique things to get rid of
4632925 luckily the internet is making it easier for us to find these things a home
4632926 we didnt know what to do they weighed about 5 tons they were just huge
4632927 there were rumors for a while that michael jackson had expressed interest in them in bringing them down to neverland
4632928 we have been discussing this issue with new york and other regulators since we announced last week our plan to purchase our retail clients ars auction rate securities and we thought we were making progress
4632929 we followed up as many leads as we had we always considered moore a person of interest but back in 2003 we didnt have enough to make the case
4632930 the article came out in the paper and based on that we started getting new leads
4632931 what makes you think i cant just take her back
4632932 this year youll see an even bigger difference because of the economy
4632933 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4632934 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4632935 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4632936 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4632937 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now
4632938 we would expect that a lot of people in the houston metro area who might have traveled further will take advantage of having great beaches and shopping on galveston island
4632939 im a kind hearted lad with a heart of gold who treats women right
4632940 i guess cashmans great farm system isnt so well stocked a we were lead to believed
4632941 all we can do now is work to see that ba gets to the oval office
4632942 without any air circulation temperatures that hot people inside a car can be can go into heatstroke or serious injury ultimately it can be fatal particularly with small children or the elderly
4632943 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4632944 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4632945 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4632946 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4632947 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4632948 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4632949 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4632950 we fought todays contest as if it was the final
4632951 if i could have my life again i would not have chosen to be an athlete
4632952 we can turn the pressure of playing in beijing to our advantage and make it a driving force
4632953 weve learned a lot and will take this experience on to 2012
4632954 its been a great journey and ive learned so much sir alan
4632955 im just looking to take the positives out of not quite running fast enough for 10 seconds

4632958 n o sabia disso fui pego de surpresa o pai est com o filho a todo momento teve a oportunidade de falar com o vald via se ele falar com o vald via e o vald via ficar timo ele est escalado para jogar muito simples n o tem problema nenhum sen o d a impress o de que o palmeiras e o luxemburgo querem que ele v embora e ningu m est mandando ele sair
4632959 ele tem a possibilidade de falar com o filho dele a todo momento e pode procurar a diretoria n o precisa criar essa rea de atrito e parecer que o palmeiras tem algum interesse a venda do vald via foi um consenso eu fui consultado e disse que se for bom para o jogador e para o clube tudo bem arrumo o time como fiz com o henrique
4632960 gostaria de entender porque ele falou disso com a imprensa se tem o filho dele ao lado todo momento pelo que entendi ele quer o que todo pai quer que o vald via jogue na europa na inglaterra it lia alemanha espanha mas tenho certeza que o vald via j falou com o pai dele antes de decidir qualquer coisa chama a diretoria e fala que n o quer o filho dele vendido
4632961 a nica proposta que veio foi do hertha berlin e ficou aqu m do que o palmeiras queria seria timo para ele jogar na europa desde que surgisse proposta de l e n o veio nenhuma outra a que surgiu foi dos emirados rabes e uma grande proposta pessoal o jogador conversou comigo e com o clube e todos viram que foi muito boa
4632962 n o podemos esquecer que algumas vendas no brasil foram feitas para o leste europeu que tamb m n o tem a mesma m dia que a europa houve algumas vendas at do palmeiras para o jap o daquele time fant stico quando passei aqui pela primeira vez nem por isso deixaram a m dia quando o jogador sabe joga em qualqer canto
4632963 n o sei se entro com tr s zagueiros ou com o evandro o fabinho e o jefferson lateral esquerdo reserva n o est o acostumados a jogar com dois zagueiros uma caracter stica deles e tamb m dos laterais brasileiro a defini o do time sai em fun o dessa situa o
4632964 ficou claro para mim que tenho que trabalhar muito o jefferson ele foi o melhor no primeiro tempo fez gol apoiou no segundo tempo quando tirei os tr s zagueiros foi uns dos piores ficou perdido n o sabia quando marcar e quando atacar mas ele tem 19 anos d para formar ele ainda como lateral
4632965 wollen wir hoffen da alle tests negativ sind und damit zumindest nach au en hin alle athleten sauber sind

4633040 one of the big problems they now face in other countries is the people in power want to reserve the money keep it for themselves so they exclude young able people who want to join their team
4633041 the result is there is no talent inside the existing parties
4633042 in other countries elections do not put up a division one team they are a division three either a b team or a c team in charge in singapore we carefully select our candidates
4633043 over the years with each election we see the quality of the mps their education levels their competence their abilities their energy their youthfulness is renewed and we have a leadership thats able to meet the rising standards of the population

4633108 if we appreciate specific actions policies or strategies and not the doer or the drafter of the strategies then we criticize and appreciate actions or processes regardless of who actually is involved in them that makes us support and criticize a certain thing depending on evidences and not mere hatred or emotion or our prior view of the individual party or person
4633109 in ethiopian politics the government is always right the public state media were hailing the ruling party for its consistency just days before the party itself admitted decadence and splitting rooted with in the party
4633110 i think that the existence of bipolarity thinking in the country makes the room for working together narrow and challenging let me put this with an example if you take journalists as professionals they must be free from partisan thinking but the bipolarity thinking forces them to stand with the government or with the oppositions side there is no room to go away from the two sides if one journalist working in government media hesitates to show sympathy for the government he she is immediately labeled as supporter of the opposition group the vice versa holds true around the private press

4633115 i love the game and i feel i can still play
4633116 if my body can still handle it want to do it
4633117 everything is going on a positive note my body is probably a little more sore than most of my teammates but i can deal with that ive worked too hard to get back
4633118 if my body couldnt handle it i might be done but so far its holding up
4633119 after my surgery coach greg schiano came to see me and i really started to think that my career was over
4633120 i actually joked with a couple of guys on the team when they would ask me if i was coming back i told them nah my shirt is going to say staff i got a couple of them believing i was going to come back as a coach
4633121 but i made up my mind i was going to come back again so here i am
4633122 and you know you cant miss a day there are things you have to do every day its boring because its the same stuff over and over but its something you have to do
4633123 whenever those guys were struggling i would tell them if i can do this three times you can do it once i tried to keep pushing them by being the model

4633125 before he started the diet he didnt have a large vocabulary at all he had a lot of fits and meltdowns
4633126 some people think how could a diet do anything about autism since autism is mostly involving the brain
4633127 there is some scientific basis to think there could be a linkage between what happens in the gut and what happens in the brain as it develops
4633128 he started throwing more fits more arguments more anxiety in everything he was doing
4633129 life is easier when his symptoms are better and we dont want to stop
4633130 if i eat certain kinds of foods the kids will know what kind of foods they can have

4633132 i didnt think it was fair to the dog to leave it here alone or to leave it at daycare
4633133 pet assisted therapy has been shown in empirical studies to reduce stress lower blood pressure and relieve pain
4633134 children who may be delayed in terms of reading skills can read to the dogs and by doing so their anxiety is reduced because the dogs dont judge them

4633150 weve got a nice place thisll just make it a little shinier
4633151 early one morning another man and i had gone out to snipe at the fascists a man jumped out of the trench and ran along the top of the parapet in full view he was half dressed and was holding up his trousers with both hands as he ran
4633152 i refrained from shooting him it is true that i am a poor shot and also that i was thinking chiefly about getting back to our trench still i did not shoot partly because of that detail about the trousers i had come here to shoot at fascists but a man who is holding up his trousers isnt a fascist he is visibly a fellow creature similar to yourself and you dont feel like shooting at him
4633153 he was supposed to report back to one of our officers after he was released from jail
4633154 we had planned to arrest him when he showed back up
4633155 the officer had to chase him down and corner him at a chain link fence

4633159 if there is pressure or stigma if you have mental health problems a drug addiction or live in poverty all of those things are likely to cause serious emotional problems later whether you had an abortion or a regular delivery
4633160 no credible evidence that a single elective abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women
4633161 it is a traumatic thing they do suffer from guilt i have seen many many cases of people who suffer clinical depression
4633162 ive talked to people that have attempted suicide in the past and they do say its because of the pain they have suffered because of abortion
4633163 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
4633164 strong and complex feelings before and after a major life decision including the decision to choose an abortion or to carry a pregnancy to term are a natural part of life
4633165 what were trying to do is get everybody pissed off and then on september 1 everyone will have to eat their words

4633170 but its going to be in my possession for one month after september 1 and then the buyer will take possession of the body
4633171 you think by riling up the bigfoot community by pissing everybody off you think thats gonna make them buy your t shirts
4633172 were selling a lot of t shirts were going to continue to build up the hype were going to continue doing everything were doing the more people we piss off the better for us
4633173 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
4633174 thats when the guys with her demanded money and our suv

4633184 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
4633185 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4633186 to the average person these places just seem like extreme wilderness where youll find lions and tigers and bears
4633187 the reality is that youre never more than a mile from a road
4633188 when we started spore we were thinking about how wed make an engine that had the possibility of expansion so yes well add to the experience
4633189 its something we eventually want to get out there as it is fun to work with
4633190 one of the greatest things that fdr did for this country
4633191 while there we met local historian roy turner who introduced us to the fascinating and little known details of presleys early years turner opened up a world that we didnt know existed
4633192 but youre in charge of swimsuits towels and sandals got it and you have to get the little girls out to the van and buckled
4633193 from chun li thanks for being there through a difficult time
4633194 whats this oh just a little something i picked up from my girlfriend
4633195 i think thats the most natural thing you can say about this club these players have the capacity to improve so well see
4633196 wayne is fit and the good thing he has done very well this week and has been progressing really well
4633197 we had quite a few opportunities last week that has to be said
4633198 we would have liked to have taken them and put the game to bed and if you dont take these chances in games that are close you can regret it
4633199 fortunately last week we were in control of the situation when it went to
4633200 but we have a good variety of midfield players and the back four are fit so we have a good foundation if we keep creating chances then we will start taking them
4633201 ok you want to know something dancing is universal its fun no matter the language no matter the time and definitely no matter the dance
4633202 well that was interesting it started off kinda slow then all of a sudden boom it was like a nightclub in the middle of the day im sure everyone is gonna remember this
4633203 it is important that hoosiers have an opportunity to meet one on one with experts from my staff who can address concerns or help with problems they may be having
4633204 the bush administration policy at issue here is cold hearted and indifferent to thousands of children in high cost of living states like new jersey children who fall in the gap between medicaid and costly private insurance do not deserve to be blocked from health coverage but that would be the result for thousands of additional children if this directive goes into effect this temporary reprieve is welcome but it needs to be followed by a full reversal of the cold hearted policy there are already thousands of children across the country being blocked from vital health coverage because their states have voluntarily complied with the bush administration and they deserve to have health insurance
4633205 i am excited that my office and covington plaza are working together to reduce paper waste in the shopping center
4633206 i am excited for covington plaza to begin these new environmental efforts
4633207 we are proud to be the first shopping center in fort wayne to start a program like this
4633208 as someone who has long viewed the deployment of missile defense as an urgent national priority todays agreement with poland is certainly welcome news
4633209 with increasing instability throughout the world and in the region we must continue to bolster our nations and our allies defenses
4633210 over the past year i have had the opportunity to travel to europe and discuss the importance of missile defense with leaders from both poland and the czech republic
4633211 senate democrats used every procedural trick in the book in an attempt to change the subject
4633212 todays announcement is good news for the future of our aerial refueling fleet our air force and our armed forces as a whole
4633213 congratulations to sandy baruah on his appointment as acting sba administrator
4633214 this appointment corresponds with a critical moment for our country and i urge mr baruah to waste no time in doing everything within his power to help small business create jobs and opportunities during the current economic slowdown i also hope that with this designation mr baruah will make progress on improving the sbas inadequate oversight over lenders and rectify the administrations recent failure to implement a meaningful womens contracting rule
4633215 simones hot dogs is a true maine treasure and a living testament to lewistons storied past and promising future
4633216 in my 35 years of public service i have always viewed simones as a touchstone of maines entrepreneurial and resilient spirit enduring and growing through a century of political and cultural change it is almost compulsory to make a stop at simones to listen to the opinions and concerns of fellow mainers over the worlds finest red dogs congratulations to the simones family for keeping such a wonderful tradition alive and i wish them the best of luck in the next one hundred years of business
4633217 these department of justice funds will coordinate the efforts of both the local law enforcement agencies and the community to prevent and control crime
4633218 it is critical that maines law enforcement entities receive the funding necessary to keep our state safe and secure and we are pleased to see such federal support for their efforts
4633219 when this mortal thing hath put on immortality then shall come to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory
4633220 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
4633221 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
4633222 the prisoners languishing in the prisons of tyrants be it infidels apostates or hypocrites christians or jews or infidels idolater and apostate
4633223 a couple could pretend to be joking before attacking the target
4633224 this would lead to his eyes nose and mouth being plugged and loses the ability to breathe
4633225 this type of weapon is excellent in close combat where fire arms are not desirable
4633226 many candidates are a sign of a healthy democracy montanans can look forward to diverse options when they vote this fall and thats a good thing
4633227 well i guess youll find out soon enough anyway im preeegnnnaaant
4633228 this represents the first demonstration that kidney injury in membranous nephropathy can regress after selective depletion of b cells thus the present data provide a strong rationale for using rituximab to treat patients with membranous nephropathy
4633229 be gone for two weeks come back for four days repeat
4633230 until they came along people could lead their entire lives without being noticed its just not right if recording it what proof is there that you exist i mean celebrities lives are preserved on film forever but what about the rest of us
4633231 shops are ok as even the grubbiest local newsagent is bristling with cameras these days just in case someone tries to whack off over the top shelf porn mags
4633232 but work can be a bit tricky most office buildings only have cameras in the car park and maybe the lobby if you are lucky
4633233 i finally solved the problem by having my camera phone all the time im in the office even when i go to the toilet
4633234 its hell on the batteries i have to carry a spare but its worth it in the long run not a moment of my working life is missed
4633235 its well worth the fixed penalty fines and points on my licence for an official time stamped record
4633236 most are ok about it and are happy just to give me copies on dvd but occasionally i have to invoke the freedom of information act and threaten legal action
4633237 ive had to make sure that the cameras in the bedroom are concealed
4633238 when i just had a high definition video camera mounted in full view on the dressing table a lot of the girls i took home thought i was some kind of perve making home porno movies since ive hidden it ive found it much easier to maintain relationships
4633239 its really fascinating i mean his life is just so mundane
4633240 i so envy him not having to deal with all the terrible stuff us celebrities have to like what shoes to wear or how to have your hair today he just exists
4633241 what point is there to your life unless other people can see it
4633242 what else would i have to show for my life a few pieces of paper birth death and exam certificates a handful of photos this way long after im gone my life will still be being watched ill still be alive to people surely thats better than ending up as just a name and a couple of dates on a grave stone
4633243 old notions of immortality playing bowls with jesus on a cloud are inadequate for the consumer generation
4633244 they want something more tangible preserving every minute of your life for eternity on high definition digital media is surely the greatest statement of materialism you can make its the modern equivalent of the egyptian pharaohs erecting those pyramids as memorials they too believed that your existence in the next life was dependent upon the number of people in the living world who still remembered your name
4633245 were living in a world where peoples worth increasingly seems to be based upon how visible they are
4633246 its all about how many hits youre getting on youtube or how many friends you have on myspace fame is the only measure of self worth
4633247 at one time people believed that having you photo taken could steal your soul now they seem to think that you arent actually real unless you are on tv
4633248 hey lifes not a rehearsal youve got to get those crucial moments right first time
4633249 this only cost me a hundred quid but it gives me all the lines i need it even gives me stage directions guiding me all the way how and when to unzip her dress which order i should kiss her breasts in even what expression i should have during the pop shot its worth every penny
4633250 ive never enjoyed family get togethers theyve always been torture for me so i had a script written for sunday lunch at my mothers last week everyone was amazed by my sparkling wit and for the first time in years the occasion wasnt ruined by rows
4633251 ive having another one run up for a meeting with my boss next week it is to discuss some irregularities in my expenses but im confident that with the right script it will be plain sailing
4633252 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4633253 there are too many instances on iphone blogs and apples own website for it to be coincidence furthermore it is not just the u s but other countries as well
4633254 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4633255 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4633256 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4633257 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4633258 i feel like i should have been up every round and every round was tied
4633259 i felt like the scoring wasnt right because i worked so hard for this and to come this far and lose in the first round it isnt right it doesnt seem real to me
4633260 two isaf service members died as a result of wounds suffered during an ied strike and small arms fire attack on their patrol in eastern afghanistan today
4633261 everyone agrees that we need to expand the pipe which means that we can get more people across quicker more efficiently
4633262 and there is a lack of money right now maybe people pay a certain amount to come cross lets assume 5 dont hold me to that but that would then pay the bonds so we can develop infrastructure
4633263 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4633264 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4633265 the time for conversations has passed the time for concrete action has come
4633266 i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4633267 get her in a place where she can have a companion get her as much space as possible and get her the total care she needs to be a happy healthy elephant
4633268 no place else in the world can offer her that kind of environment
4633269 and were going to make sure she goes there because we care about her and shes family
4633270 in this article the authors argue that the overwhelming portion of the literature on intelligence race and genetics is based on folk taxonomies rather than scientific analysis they suggest that because theorists of intelligence disagree as to what it is any consideration of its relationships to other constructs must be tentative at best they further argue that race is a social construction with no scientific definition thus studies of the relationship between race and other constructs may serve social ends but cannot serve scientific ends no gene has yet been conclusively linked to intelligence so attempts to provide a compelling genetic link of race to intelligence are not feasible at this time the authors also show that heritability a behaviorgenetic concept is inadequate in regard to providing such a link
4633271 sternberg in press found that analytical tests of the kind traditionally used to measure so called general abilities tend rather strongly to favor americans of european and asian origin but tests of creative and practical thinking show quite different patterns we also know that there is a substantial genetic influence contributing to individual differences in levels of academic achievement luo thompson amp detterman 2003 yet we do not know a single gene that has been identified as contributing to either academic achievement or iq thus the statement that racial differences in iq or academic achievement are of genetic origin is when all is said and done a leap of imagination the literature on intelligence race and genetics constitutes in large part leaps of imagination to justify post hoc social stratifications there is nothing wrong in principle with people expressing their views on social policy but they need to recognize these views for what they are social policy pronouncements not science
4633272 the urc has a winning formula combining caring for seniors with caring for children in a way that benefits everyone
4633273 with baby boomers heading into retirement and wanting to remain active we must look to programs like urc and its child development center as models for improving care for seniors and children we must foster the innovation and creativity that we see here at urc throughout the state and country
4633274 the staff at concords healthsouth does a tremendous job at delivering top quality rehabilitation and critical care services and i enjoyed the opportunity to see first hand how they help so many on the road to recovery
4633275 national health center week is an appropriate opportunity to thank them and other health care providers for their work whether provided at a community health center hospital or other specialized facility they can be assured that i will continue to strongly support their mission
4633276 and on the patient side i will continue the fight to make health care more affordable and accessible to all
4633277 reforms in legislation that i have co sponsored the making health care more affordable act expand coverage to those who need it without jeopardizing the coverage of those who are insured today by providing individuals with health insurance tax credits allowing small businesses to band together to buy plans and encouraging high tech efficiencies we open doors to expanded and affordable coverage to everyone
4633278 we welcomed the opportunity to meet the senator and show him the tremendous work that goes on in our hospital and other acute rehabilitation hospitals everyday we appreciate his ongoing support of issues that have an effect on access and reimbursement for rehabilitation services in this challenging healthcare environment

4633281 economic development begins with a solid infrastructure and plummer like many rural cities has struggled with issues surrounding the decline of its wastewater treatment system
4633282 in a part of idaho that has seen improvements with rural medicine and broadband service the wastewater capacity issues stood out in need of attention today these issues are being resolved thanks to local problem solving and assistance with funding through usda rural development tribal funds and money in the farm bill now we can bring new housing on line and ensure the future development and expansion for facilities like berg integrated systems which supplies our military needs and for future development of industry and housing in the area
4633283 the reconstruction of plummers sanitary sewer system is a vital step towards the long term health safety and economic revitalization of plummer
4633284 the leadership demonstrated by city and tribal leaders as well as the dedication of our usda rural development staff to find workable solutions has helped move this project forward which should bring greater economic stability to the city of plummer

4633288 is john mccain trying to bring back the cold war again halliburton and all the big defense contractors are just salivating
4633289 we are going to need congressional action to make sure that people can get reasonably priced cable television left alone prices will continue to rise and families are going to be priced out of cable television

4633291 ooh gooddy send me gt to the twilight zone again
4633292 you wicked one you want to wage war against me by your life i will wage war against you
4633293 on the eve of next weeks g 8 summit meeting relations between the united states and russia have ebbed to their lowest level since the cold war fueled by moscows growing confidence and
4633294 son of man set your face against gog of the land of magog the chief prince of meshech and tubal prophesy against him revelation 20 8 and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth gog and magog to gather them for battle in number they are like the sand on the seashore jeremiah 1 15 i am about to summon all the peoples of the northern kingdoms

4633305 canada will now embark on its own journey on the search for these two vessels which has the allure of an indiana jones mystery
4633306 the franklin expedition is a key part of canadas history of arctic exploration as canada is once again asserting ourselves and protecting our sovereignty in the high arctic this expedition will provide important new information and will add to the body of research on the fate of these ships
4633307 we have staked our claim its use it or lose it for far too long our country has not had a strong presence in the far north
4633308 some sad incidents happened at a time when we had a boom in the tourism industry it is as if the sun had set at noon
4633309 my effort will be bring the leaders of the agitation to the table so that all the problems are resolved
4633310 the governments deliberate plan is to cause a dysfunctional chaotic parliament
4633311 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
4633312 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
4633313 stopping al qaeda in iraq is the key to winning the greater war on terror
4633314 we have to win in iraq to spread democracy across the middle east

4633326 its very rare that all three riders are in the form of their life on the same day but thats what happened tonight
4633327 i just said to myself this is my lap im going its your problem
4633328 i struggled with the speed the guys go in the first two laps
4633329 you can either give it everything to close the gap and use up energy or pace it try and close it on the home straight so youre finishing level with the second rider at the end of his lap its not the ideal way to do it its the hard way but the important thing is not to panic
4633330 the french were really thinking that they were going to win and this will be a real kick in the goolies for them
4633331 im not surprised we are in a class of our own
4633332 everyone was giving it large after the world championships saying how were they going to do it again but this is what it is all about the worlds was just there and we did it
4633333 id compare it to athens and the start the australians got they wiped the board and were the supreme nation with a haul of six gold two silver and two bronze medals and hopefully a bit of that has rubbed off on to us now it should bring total confidence throughout the camp
4633334 they are supposed to be developing guys for the future not winning gold medals
4633335 we havent actually got a funding level in the academies for gold medal winners
4633336 jackie was just speedin away thought she was james dean for a day
4633337 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4633338 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4633339 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4633340 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4633341 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

4633355 but life without meaning is the torture of restlessness an
4633356 the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must
4633357 its just one of the ways we do things now
4633358 i was diagnosed with add twice i didnt believe the first doctor who told me and i had a whole theory that add was just something they invented to make you pay for medicine
4633359 id describe it as typical kansas thunderstorm only maybe on the strong side
4633360 the chinese staff was doing everything they could but one of them said it was something theyd never experienced theyd never shut down the gondola because of weather
4633361 we knew the strikes were close by maybe a quarter or half mile because of the intensity of the thunder
4633362 there was no panic but it was a little exciting the storm just kept going and we began wondering if we were not going to get down until morning
4633363 we realized that it would be thousands of times less expensive to produce the games on a computer than to actually build so much infrastructure
4633364 it was incredibly easy to adapt the information control mechanisms we employ to maintain the ignorance of our own population to the new purpose of preventing the visiting foreigners from sending any unauthorized information out
4633365 in the false footage you can see almost a kilometer into the distance
4633366 in reality you are lucky to see more than a few hundred meters it took us six months to get enough footage from around the city to make the composites you saw on television
4633367 i think that the free tibet banner was my favorite part
4633368 if anyone did suspect our lies that really would have thrown them off
4633369 sterling remains vulnerable especially against the us dollar the pound averaged 1 55 over 1993 2002 and it would not be a surprise to see a return to those levels in the next 12 18 months
4633370 the us was the first economy to hit trouble now people are realising that the uk has the same problems if not more so as the us
4633371 increases in food and energy bills will intensify the squeeze on real take home pay which for many households is unlikely to grow this year
4633372 these are circumstances in which consumer spending and house prices are likely to weaken together
4633373 we might get to 110 how quickly we get there would depend on the demand outlook if next weeks us inventory data shows an increase in stocks we could go lower
4633374 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end
4633375 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
4633376 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
4633377 there are so many important issues like the nuclear issue iraq the caucasus afghanistan
4633378 iran is definitely having some influence of these issues so we are talking
4633379 we dont want to see weapons of mass destruction in this region
4633380 if its in our neighbourhood we definitely dont want to see it
4633381 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
4633382 i wish to see turkey as an island where the european standard of democracy is being fulfilled and the free market economy is functioning very well
4633383 this will be a real gift to the region to the world for peace and this turkey will be a source of inspiration for so many
4633384 as we are transforming ourselves in that direction we will not forget our natural links and relationships and advantages with other countries muslim countries central asian countries caucasus countries middle eastern and other countries
4633385 turkey is having a positive impact on them spreading the values of democracy freedom rule of law also the economic changes here are admired maybe that is the indirect influence of this country
4633386 in the last two years we spent our energy on domestic issues and the reforms slowed down
4633387 now after the court case there is a new era this is a big opportunity for turkey everybody realises that reforms are necessary
4633388 turkey has great capacity to influence the region indirectly very peacefully being an inspiration for changes turkey has been playing this role already this has not been appreciated enough
4633389 europe should realise that turkey can do more for the stability and security of the region
4633390 start with the caucasus last month the problem was not serious but suddenly we found ourselves in a war situation
4633391 europe should encourage turkey and not create some artificial problems during the negotiation process with us some member countries or some politicians should not mix domestic issues and strategic issues domestic issues are conjunctural today its there and tomorrow its not but the strategic issues are always there and we cannot sacrifice strategic issues for domestic issues unfortunately nowadays we see this kind of shortsighted policies in some countries
4633392 some call it terror some call it the south east problem some call it the kurdish problem whatever you call it we will find a solution
4633393 there are other problems secularism and anti secularism those things will also find solutions in this climate that is why i focus on the reform process the problem was this the lack of democracy the standard of democracy that was creating problems not only in the south east but in other issues that is when we upgrade the standards these problems will find solutions
4633394 but having a good relationship helps the stability of the region
4633395 by deploying poland is exposing itself to a strike 100
4633396 it is rare that all the blame is on one side in fact both sides are probably to blame that is very important to understand
4633397 profound implications for russia this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4633398 you cant be a responsible member of institutions which are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours
4633399 russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west its going to replicate what happened in georgia elsewhere
4633400 we are looking evil directly in the eye today this evil is very strong and very dangerous for everybody not just for us
4633401 georgia has been attacked russian forces need to leave georgia at once
4633402 must take place and take place now this is no longer 1968
4633403 our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone
4633404 but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except russian peacekeepers
4633405 this clearly demonstrates the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation
4633406 heres your song dont mess with it dont even sing over it
4633407 teach yourself lisp show us some code thats properly formatted and well hire you and see how it goes
4633408 it was one of those nights when i wore a supertight dress that you couldnt have worn anything under since it would have showed
4633409 the paparazzi were literally lowering their cameras like speculums when i got out of the car
4633410 ill keep performing but i doubt if ill make any more albums
4633411 i lose more balls than anyone on the course because i wont go in the rough to get them there are snakes everywhere and they give me the willies
4633412 we decided we didnt want publicity we wanted to get married just between ourselves and our children and the judge who is an old friend of the family
4633413 i realised that i hear about these secret celebrity marriages the day after they happen and i dont think anybody is really trying to have a truly secret marriage but most of the fans and most of the media dont even know that im married
4633414 it can be a total secret theres no reason why the helicopters have to show up we were originally gonna do it on a public beach some place until we found out you have to register to do that and get a permit so immediately theyd call up the media and the paparazzi would be showing up
4633415 i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4633416 neither of the grounds put forward by the district court grounds which have been loosely characterized as government deception and outrageous conduct supports the drastic remedy of dismissal of the indictment
4633417 we wanted to come to you even i paul time and again but satan hindered us
4633418 the lord is my strength he will make my feet like deers feet and he will make me walk on my high hills
4633419 you meant it for evil but god meant it for good
4633420 well dont stand there if you are coming in come in
4633421 wesley snipes would be like 3 45am obamas only like 8 20pm
4633422 its a bit late now like putting on a condom after sex
4633423 the brothers taking care of the lawn were saying how they heard id hit a good shot on number 12 then i go inside and the sisters inside were telling me they heard i did good at number 12 it was hilarious to me that was the first theyd ever seen that there
4633424 this better be funny i have ice cream in my bag
4633425 this is a hispanic show you dont mind do you george
4633426 im at the restaurant a lot i even make fresh guacamole at the tables sometimes i love it i do make the best guacamole ever you know
4633427 i love to cook once after a gypsy kings performance tony and i were so into their performance and their music we invited them back to our house they were playing in my kitchen and i made fresh tortillas and guacamole they even wrote a song just for me later recording it just for us to have
4633428 i even got an adjustable stipper pole that was supposed to fit anywhere
4633429 seen out with a girl young enough to be his daughter
4633430 when they found that head there was a big deal in town
4633431 there are many people who know a lot but they do not want to talk because they dont like it
4633432 when he met the ladies he kissed their hands he would open doors for them american guys dont do that
4633433 i was surprised how many smart people in san marino looked up to him
4633434 there was something wrong with the guy he was a flaky guy his story shifted and changed
4633435 was that he said he was working in film and television but when i asked how many tv sets he had he said i dont own a tv i dont like it
4633436 but how can you be that plausible a con artist is a con artist
4633437 he lived in a separate house in the back and dealt mostly with the mother his landlord
4633438 poor deirdre obviously doesnt have a very good fund manager because despite working for a living in one of those ghastly real jobs where you cant write down lunch at the ivy as an expense she hasnt been able to afford a doula or an au pair far less a nanny and has therefore had to gasp raise her own children this has left very little time or money to spend on beauty therapies and has sadly resulted in her looking like a radiation victim who gets dressed in the dark
4633439 this week well be meeting tabitha shes a successful television presenter with her own production company but she doesnt know which lap dancing club her coke addled boyfriend is currently favouring and is still trying to prove her worth to a father who always seemed to love her older sister more she recently spent more than she pays her char per annum to have her home spiritually cleansed owns a wardrobe worth more than the average house and hasnt worn the wrong thing since her second form end of term disco nonetheless she wouldnt be able to tell you the name of the prime minister without googling and cant find her own 40 000 wet room without her pa relaying directions via her blackberry tonight were going to help her calculate the true worth of her existence using our famous vacu ometer then after weve talked her down from the ledge well have our regular consultant deirdre on hand to give tabitha some tips on building relationships with people whose affection wont be conditional upon her haircut
4633440 these startling figures show that the government is building a national dna database by stealth there can be no excuse for storing the dna of innocent adults let alone children who are entirely blameless
4633441 we are absorbing the costs the investment is at the expense of tesco not the farmers
4633442 the supermarkets are telling us they will pay for price cuts out of their own money but we have bitter experience of what happens in the medium to long term
4633443 if farmers cant recoup those increases they will end up not producing next year and if production falls then prices will rise further
4633444 rising costs continue to hit customers hard and they are looking to tesco to help
4633445 negotiated some fantastic deals with our suppliers to bring shopping bills down
4633446 the fact that prices are going up at shop level does not mean the farmers are getting more
4633447 a straight race between the two giant arches along the the royal mile first past the post is the winner except no running walking only please if anyone offers you a flyer you have to turn around go back to the beginning and start again
4633448 quite often you go to a war and have quite a quiet and banal time and meet boring people
4633449 the flights could not operate if these strikes go ahead it would effectively shut down the airlines operations
4633450 the airlines and swissport will attempt to draft in management and where possible use non unionised workers
4633451 there will be a risk of delays and this is worst time of year for it to happen at the peak of the summer season when flights are their fullest
4633452 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions our members have had enough
4633453 this strike is totally unjustified union chiefs should be grateful that they are getting any increase at all at a challenging time for the global economy

4633465 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting divorced in the first place
4633466 everyone agrees that we need to expand the pipe which means that we can get more people across quicker more efficiently
4633467 and there is a lack of money right now maybe people pay a certain amount to come cross lets assume 5 dont hold me to that but that would then pay the bonds so we can develop infrastructure

4633471 madonna is at the end of a 30 year cycle in her life a true maturing is happening now its a time when the body starts to show age ageing is never easy for a leo
4633472 going forward she may grow into playing the role of grand dame of the music industry over the next two years well see another face another reinvention of herself that we have not yet witnessed in the past
4633473 she does best in the city of los angeles but in london she shines in a regal way new york is a more stressful city in that saturn is stronger there causing her to feel pressured to work harder
4633474 she should be careful of her health during this two year period as neptune transiting her house of health can possibly bring a health crisis
4633475 madonna should be focusing on altruistic activities otherwise it can create a lot of negative publicity this is not a good time for her to be seeking any accolade for its own sake
4633476 its far better for her to perform acts of altruism that are for communities and the benefit of the world rather than spend time on projects which will get her noticed just for publicity if she seeks no rewards and does work for the goodness of the masses she will reap great benefits
4633477 an eclipse on her sun does indicate a big year ahead for her possibly major shifts in her relationship with her husband and the role he plays in her life she may be relating to the world and seeking a deeper metaphysical life experience more than she is relating to her partner
4633478 eclipses come in cycles the last time madonna experienced this particular eclipse cycle was when she met and became involved with her current husband guy ritchie the cycle before that one was when she and her first husband sean penn got divorced so her marriage may experience some challenges now
4633479 we ask the media for time and privacy as we seek to deal with this tragedy which is beyond our understanding

4633492 the deployment of new missile defense elements in europe has the russian federation as its aim
4633493 we will continue working on this issue we are ready to continue discussing these issues with all the parties
4633494 the poles should be thanked for helping reveal the strategic goal of the u s missile defense plan
4633495 regrettably in the extremely difficult situation that has evolved today the american side is aggravating the relationship between the u s and russia
4633496 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
4633497 this is my country i will stay to rebuild who am i if i leave now

4633499 i love to dream but i think anything real scares me to death
4633500 dont let me interrupt you sir if you are busy117
4633501 and realized that with the films that had been released through 2003 there were nine pg 13 movies that had averaged 200 million in domestic box office
4633502 we dont need anything from a third outside party we get to just focus on making the best movies possible
4633503 i realized that if marvel was able to get the financial upside the company could double or more its market value just through that move and good execution
4633504 is that this is our complete focus were people who love our jobs and plan to be in the jobs for many many years if not decades and our characters come from a universe thats so connected and now that we have control of actually creatively making the films and greenlighting the movies
4633505 were able to plan out the future in that way its was an idea that kevin and i came up with a couple of years ago lets try and make all the movies not stand alone but connect in the same continuity and the same universe which was a new idea for superhero films that wouldnt have been able to accomplish that if we didnt have the studio created the way it has been
4633506 truly i say unto you that unless you be converted and become as little children you shall not enter the

4633534 itu bagus bagus saja karena aturan keselamatan penerbangan menyebutkan kalau selasar ke check in itu daerah steril artinya tidak boleh ada kendaraan yang parkir atau berhenti lama di sana
4633535 saya juga kesal melihat ada pejabat yang seperti itu rasanya negara punya dia sendiri saja aturan keselamatan ini berlaku untuk semua orang bahkan mobil presiden pun tidak boleh parkir di sekitar tempat itu
4633536 ini kadang bosnya masih di udara sopirnya sudah maksa parkir pejabat yang setengah karbitan itu yang nggak benar

4633551 so we have the markets expecting the bank to cut uk rates later this year and also people expecting the us to come out of the slowdown before the uk and europe
4633552 mervyn king has only now shifted the focus to weak growth so the market is anticipating a recovery over there faster than over here
4633553 a year ago the feeling was that sterling had been overvalued for the best part of a decade so a gentle decline would be welcome to help rebalance away from such strong reliance on consumer and government spending towards a greater contribution from exports and investment
4633554 it will be business as usual but unfortunately business as usual is not going to be very good
4633555 believes that there is scope for a combination with michael page which is to the benefit of both companies and their respective shareholders
4633556 we think that unless it returns with an offer for the entire company in cash at 450p or more it will not get michael page back to the negotiating table and a deal is unlikely below 500p
4633557 after careful consideration and discussion with its advisers the board of michael page unanimously concluded that this proposal materially undervalued the company and its prospects
4633558 weve had a tough 12 months or so because of a number of factors all conspiring at one time
4633559 in difficult times the go to places to drive revenue in the licensing part of our business is film and tv in the us so that made life very tricky indeed
4633560 to cap it all at the end of 2007 and into the start of this year we had a freakishly light release schedule
4633561 we try to live our outdoor brand values so no one was really shocked but there were a few people who were worried about their shape there were a few moans and groans
4633562 traditionally we have been much bigger in apparel than footwear by 2010 we plan to increase our footwear offer quite dramatically
4633563 we want to open a few uk stores in strategic areas to showcase the brand to consumers
4633564 it the uk is one of our fastest growing businesses
4633565 i am big eater and i had done lots of exercise already that day
4633566 by the end of the meeting we were in agreement that the price of the business was too high and we decided to make a counter offer

4633572 how would we have reacted if moscow had brought western europe into the warsaw pact established bases in mexico and panama put missile defense radars and rockets in cuba and joined with china to build pipelines to transfer mexican and venezuelan oil to pacific ports for shipment to asia and cut us out if there were russian and chinese advisers training latin american armies the way we are in the former soviet republics how would we react would we look with bemusement on such russian behavior

4633575 inflation in energy prices is passing through to other items and the disinflation we have previously seen from cheap imports is now clearly a thing of the past the fed is in a predicament it could raise rates to drive down demand but how much do you want to sacrifice for that new jobless claims are already definitely at recession levels
4633576 heathrow has been changed significantly by open skies and that was one of the main stumbling blocks last time around we are in a different competitive environment and a lot of the issues that concerned people if not all of them are no longer there
4633577 the other two alliances already have anti trust immunity on transatlantic flights so this application would allow one world to compete more effectively
4633578 it is a very competitive market but this latest round of price cuts is not heralding a value destructive price war
4633579 customers are not prepared to forgo their main summer holiday
4633580 i dont believe they are prepared to forgo their second winter holiday either albeit they may wish to cut back on expenditure
4633581 customers are booking earlier and the remainder of the summer has 18 per cent fewer holidays remaining than last year
4633582 whilst looking at price rises for next year we are still significantly cheaper than holidaying in the uk
4633583 in june and july the number of people who wanted to get out of their obligation to buy was an avalanche and we had to throw money at that to ensure they completed
4633584 the government should say nothing or come out with an actual policy because otherwise it just creates confusion
4633585 things are almost certainly not going to turn out as fears would have it today what we are seeing is a normal business cycle our buildings will last 50 100 years or more and will outlast many business cycles
4633586 the doom and gloom that is prevalent is way overdone as it relates to the fundamental cash flow certainty of our prime buildings
4633587 has the world changed and we are all going to live in tents or move into space or is the financial centre going to relocate to birmingham from london lets have some perspective about it

4633605 as we progress let us remember every mistake every memory and every dream everything that made us who we are today the mistakes transform us into bigger people the memories get us out of hard times and the dreams become realities
4633606 take pride in every little mistake every little stumble because it just means it wont happen again

4633608 every season is a season when you have to win something but the difference between winning and losing is very small at the moment for me the two massive trophies are the premier league and the champions league we were close in both competitions last season so lets go and try again we want to win things but had we made 70 points and won the carling cup people would have said for me it is not satisfying we will not play every year like last year and lose out in the end we have to reconsider and play exactly the same what is dreadful when you are a big club is to be out of the title race in september that is why it is so important to get a good start
4633609 i think you always want to buy the players at the right price when you want to move a club forward as i think i have done here in the last 10 years some investment is needed not only to buy players but to spot players when they are not necessarily stars the quality of a manager is as well to develop players big signings reassure the fans but performances are better when we bought adebayor who was thinking that he is a great player we bought him for what you can call at the time a reasonable price but it is not necessarily linked with the price of the players it is linked with the how well the player develops how good he becomes and then you assess the situation of the player once he plays i am able to make signings at high prices but you have to have a cohesion as well in the way you buy manchester united are in the 20 30 million bracket of the market chelsea are in an unlimited bracket and we have to be in our own bracket reasonable but shrewd of course i have made mistakes there are players i should have done but none at 30m
4633610 basically we balance the budget in the way we run the club i have the money available to buy the players but we go into the competition with that target i think every manager should do this we have gone three or four years into a different policy of bringing on our own players which we have to see through but i am convinced we have opted for stability with young players who have spirit of our game the spirit of our club and i believe we will show we are more united and that we have the needed belief to be successful that should be one of the advantages we have in this

4633632 we feel epa placed the public health and the environment at risk by not doing a number of required analyses before it issued the permit
4633633 epa caved in to the pressure and issued the permit without doing the analyses
4633634 we are also very concerned about mercury pollution especially because the fish in the san juan river are already compromised
4633635 advisories already exist for several lakes in the four corners area
4633636 this permit is another example of the rush by the agencys political appointees to hand out gifts to industry before president bush leaves office

4633670 obviously in terms of value of money i want to look at the whole lecturing profile i want to make sure that the senior people in our universities who are the most professional who have the greatest experience and who can make a valuable contribution to students are actually in the classroom from time to time
4633671 they the colleges and universities are saying that they do not have adequate funds but i am looking at exactly what funds we have put into the third level sector
4633672 we have already increased funding by 25pc in three years that is an outstanding achievement but people have been critical of the hse and the amount of funding that has been put into the hse and have questioned exactly what has been attained from that funding
4633673 i as minister want to carry out an audit on the third level sector and i am going to have a look at a number of the institutions and to see how they are performing how the money is targeted and if we are getting the benefits from it
4633674 i also want to see that money is targeted towards students student services and social inclusion
4633675 we have five floors go up floor by floor and once you find what you are looking for you can stay there its easy to decide since each floor has a sign telling you whats inside

4633684 the monkey learns by first observing the movement which activates his brain cells as if he were doing it its a lot like sports training where trainers have athletes first imagine that they are performing the movements they desire
4633685 oh im fine ill just make sure i really pay attention to the road and drive the speed limit ill be just fine
4633686 out there tonight are a lot of human beings they are driving around whether they are on a vacation going home going to visit someone picking up their kids going to the hospital going to the grocery store whatever these people are all innocent these people have lives these people are husbands wives sons daughters aunts uncles sisters brothers grandmothers babies teachers the list goes on and on
4633687 thats money i could have put in my childrens college fund
4633688 john ended up dishonoring an awful lot of people in this process from his family to a lot of his supporters
4633689 his campaign even in light of all this served a purpose
4633690 it forced the other democratic candidates to talk about things they otherwise would not have talked about poverty has not been an issue for a long time it is now because john edwards forced the other democrats to talk about it
4633691 i could think of better ways to spend that money than on his girlfriends videos

4633696 the two assistants were discussing their pastors thrifty ways and they agreed that if the pastor when he dies sees a light at the end of the tunnel hell turn it off
4633697 will you take it off before i lay me down
4633698 it the net is closing on the offenders and we will get a result and that is what john and his family deserve
4633699 no family deserves to have their 14 year old son die in their arms and that is the bottom line here
4633700 people have worked very hard to try get that programme up and running and maintain it there has also been a lack of support in a number of areas which im not going to go into here
4633701 it is devastating because everyone else playing here in beijing is a professional player unless new zealand can get our players into environments where they can play at a professional level its always going to be very difficult to come to the olympics and be competitive
4633702 in athens we were competitive because we had two superstars who were professionals we didnt have them this time we had a bunch of young kids trying to learn the game
4633703 since then theyve employed one of the best coaches in the world former tall ferns mentor tom maher had players in a programme getting daily involvement and being able to tour the world and play the best teams in the world
4633704 in new zealand we dont have the same resources as they have in china but weve got to try and replicate that type of development programme to be successful at an event like the olympics
4633705 hopefully a new zealand team gets put in next year but it wasnt unsettling
4633706 a lot of our players are in college like julia harmon jess mccormack and micaela cocks im sure the ones we need to keep for the next campaign will find a team
4633707 lisa wallbutton shes a hell of a player shell definitely find a team most of the other players are either going to get to play or are going to retire i know basketball new zealand and australia will work hard to make sure there is a new zealand team in the competition thats really important for the oceania region
4633708 we just have to go out in these sort of games and develop our own ability against the best players in the world
4633709 if you want to be the best youve got to play against the best
4633710 were looking forward to the opportunity but youve got to be realistic my bunch of kids with an average age of 22 are playing a bunch of seasoned professional players weve got to find some wins in it weve got to find other ways to win
4633711 youre playing the best players in the world and probably the best team along with australia its one of those things where youve just got to go out and give it your best shot
4633712 its not every day you get to play against players of that quality the majority of our players are young hopefully theyll see what the best players in the world do and what weve got to do to compete at that level
4633713 personally im looking forward to it its not every day i get to play against star us point guard sue bird
4633714 he she looks familiar but i cant remember from where

4633717 already in may we realized that the russians began to build a railroad in abkhazia and that the russian army slowly and steadily will be moving towards our borders and then to tbilisi we had a choice either to capitulate and not use artillery or fight and then capitulate
4633718 if the situation grows worse we might have a major humanitarian catastrophe on our hands
4633719 we see reports that the forest outside bordzhomi a city of 35 000 people is burning russian troops are very close to kutaisi georgias second largest city of 200 000 people
4633720 on aug 12 we saw presumably irregulars or southern ossetian militia looting houses in java village taking out carpets tv sets and furniture
4633721 old and sick people who are unable to run about 20 of them are now dying in the burning villages it was too dangerous for us to go into the villages as we heard shootings
4633722 i know that nothing is left of my house and my barber shop
4633723 we are victims of a personal conflict between georgian president mikheil saakashvoli and russian prime minister vladimir putin that was their personal conflict that thousands of us here have suffered from
4633724 time has stopped for me this week all i think about is how to help people pouring into my institute and how to save the most valuable equipment we have here
4633725 what happened some of them not do properly the work and some of them not happy we do not know why they not happy
4633726 in a nutshell i believe we have got to have a more vigorous selection process when we go to the islands to get them once they are here we have to put them through a cultural training camp to teach them how to live here and this initiation has to be supported by government
4633727 if they cant get through it thats when they should be sent home if they can then they can go on to the growers for training
4633728 this is the first time that contractors have had access to reliable stable and steady supplies of labour there will be some costs of training and development we recognise that and the rses go into this with their eyes open
4633729 they have made a business decision to recruit because they see the value of such a stable and steady supply of labour under the rse
4633730 highly unlikely that any of the kiribati workers who have left have not worked the minimum of 240 hours given the amount of time they have been here

4633737 for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works
4633738 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
4633739 t he lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance
4633740 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction
4633741 enter by the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and there are many who go in by it because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life and there are few who find it

4633749 i am proud to be pioneering a sport that allows middle aged obese people to reach their olympic dreams just like the young and fit people of the world
4633750 i know that its a position that if i can do it can help me out
4633751 it feels good doesnt feel great but it feels good
4633752 i just have to get over the fact its going to hurt some not think about it just do it its something that wont really heal for awhile i just have to handle it the best i can and deal with it
4633753 i didnt imagine making the error but i imagined the ball coming to me thats how it happens i talked to ben zobrist after the inning and hes like i got one ball the whole series and i got two balls hit to me in one inning
4633754 hes been getting better and better then yesterday before the game we went out and played catch his throws were fine
4633755 and he said he was ready to roll well have to see but i saw it yesterday playing catch i think hes ready to roll
4633756 were in discussions and wed like to get a few more guys signed
4633757 i dont know if were close on anything but well be working right up until the deadline
4633758 we dont blatantly abuse the system but there are times when you have to go over slot
4633759 i just really believe that this first year is a big year for development
4633760 were just fortunate that these guys had the same feeling
4633761 we felt like in the rounds we were taking we were taking the best guy
4633762 it just so happened the signability fell in place it certainly does feel a little bit strange but its a good feeling
4633763 they really put a lot of emphasis on this first year of development
4633764 the courses on the pga tour have been set up hard so its a nice change to be really aggressive and sedgefield kind of suits my style
4633765 i try to play really aggressive all the time and so far its paid off great
4633766 as soon as i did that my mind kind of set in and played nice all day
4633767 every time i made a birdie it seemed like he made one too
4633768 this course you can make a lot of birdies but its quite easy to have a few bogeys in there too
4633769 i kind of knew at the beginning of the week i thought it was going to be a low scoring week just because you have a lot of wedges 8 irons 9 irons into par 4s
4633770 i was having problems with my timing but when i made a passing shot on a set point i started feeling better
4633771 i was up 5 3 in the first set and i lost my serve and then she won her serve and it was 5 5 and then were in a tiebreaker where anything can happen
4633772 if i would have had a little more focus i could have held serve and won the first set 6 3 but she has a lot of experience she was battling for every point even when she was down 5 2
4633773 i decided to just focus on every point and i started feeling better
4633774 i was able to play my game in the second set and i guess she had trouble with it
4633775 i was fighting it it still hurts ill have to get treatment on it and get ready for the u s open
4633776 i think this was my easiest match against her but i didnt exactly play my best
4633777 my returns werent working well and i had a little problem with concentration
4633778 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4633779 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4633780 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4633781 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4633782 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4633783 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4633784 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4633785 sellers need to be able to see how their items will appear in the new page being tested so they can make adjustments as necessary as a seller if you have an item listed simply sign in and click the new preview link at the top of your listing to view the item as it would appear in the new design

4633788 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4633789 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective

4633792 we ask the media for time and privacy as we seek to deal with this tragedy which is beyond our understanding
4633793 its the biggest one made by wurlitzer and that makes it historic and in a theatre that is historic
4633794 i looked in the mirror and i said why not

4633800 the russian invasion of my country was a well planned highly organized military attack that was many months in the making and relied on provocations going back several years
4633801 russia views georgia as a thread because of our commitment to freedom democracy and human rights our countrys destiny is to be integrated with the west and bridge europe with central asia
4633802 the invasion of georgia is meant to force these countries to depend on russia for the transit of their natural wealth to europe and make europe more heavily dependent on russia for their energy needs
4633803 if you want to know the truth about it nothin ever really ends but something new dont begin when somethin ends in our sight it begins somewhere else where we cant hear it or see it or feel it
4633804 the tortures occur if they are unnecessary then there is no god or a bad one if there is a good god then these tortures are necessary for no even moderately good being could possibly inflict or permit them if they werent
4633805 the truth about it is whether we is rich or poor or somethin in between this earth aint no final restin place so in a way we is all homeless just workin our way toward home
4633806 as dowd would have it men simply find her intelligence her status her wit too daunting
4633807 but is it possible that there is something else at play a new york magazine piece describes the wide variety of men dowd has been involved with ranging from movie stars to important editors to creators of television dramas one imagines that her intelligence her sharpness her sarcasm may even have interested these men could there possibly be another reason that the attractive successful dowd has not settled down
4633808 the book isnt at all pessimistic about the chances of strong successful women
4633809 but a lot of times i think its turned out that men find those things drainin g and oftentimes would rather be with a woman who is in awe of them
4633810 men are simply not biologically suited to hold higher office the bush administration has proved that once and for all
4633811 my question does not stem from disrespect for my country whatsoever just from the simple understanding if singapore is but a piece of land it can not appreciate all the money pumped into the fireworks and staged performances i guess

4633827 if you are interested in placing an abandoned vehicle in your name by obtaining the title and placing registration on it you will need to contact the department of motor vehicles state laws differ but if the owner is unknown you may be able to find the owner if you take the license plate number and vin of the vehicle to the dmv so that the owner can be identified also if you do not know the owner but a car is abandoned you may want to check with law enforcement first to make sure the vehicle has not been stolen and abandoned the police may be able to identify the owners of the vehicle if they do again you could discuss taking over the title of the car from the owners depending on state laws you may be able to request a lost title from the dmv and take it to the owners for them to sign over the vehicle to you if you already know the owner of the car that is seemingly abandoned then you should discuss with them signing over the title to you so that you can transfer the title and placed registration in your name at the dmv if you are able to take title of the abandoned vehicle check with us for a quick car insurance quote
4633828 one of the things you want a tax system to do is to reward work to give working families a chance to work their way up
4633829 and one of the ways you can do that is just by not taxing working moderate families too much
4633830 con este despido se merma la calidad en el trabajo del medio de comunicaci n

4633833 on a scale of 1 10 what would you rate the webkinz parlor
4633834 dont go to webbieheaders anymore webkinz parlor is much cooler
4633835 omg i have 4 000 veiws i adrien is so good and i had this website maybe like one week
4633836 i promise to get all the paperwork in order well release the silverton from all responsibility and liability and well return to perform the escape i have to do it
4633837 then i have to be able to get my hand outside the exposed bar and pick one lock and then unravel an un known combination of a second lock and then get to the surface without blowing out my eardrums from the pressure
4633838 this has never been done before underwater i have to hold my breath and the steel box which is no larger than an animal luggage box used on airlines gives me absolutely no room for movement
4633839 ive trained myself to hold my breath for up to four minutes underwater but with all the exertion of getting out of the metal cuffs on my hands and feet the air gets used up much faster if i could get out in 30 seconds believe me i would but it takes almost the length of the hold of my breath theres not much room for safety
4633840 houdini did this escape once in a wooden box with no openings he had it lowered into a murky river so nobody could see anything ive been called the 21st century houdini and i wanted my fans to see me inside the box and getting free
4633841 the key policy rate should be in the interval 5 6 per cent in the period to the publication of the next report on 29 october unless the norwegian economy is exposed to major shocks
4633842 it seems the designers used a lot more fabric when i first got here
4633843 mr ailey he always said dance came from the people
4633844 im not a black anything first of all im a human being and i dont really like being put into a box
4633845 mr ailey was reacting to the fact that we couldnt see our own images up there on the stage he wanted to say something about our beauty about our intelligence about our craft and our experience
4633846 we have evolved and reinvented ourselves but based on the premise that this man thought of a long time ago that dance should be accessible
4633847 and they loved us and we still kept true to our ailey vision
4633848 im the most dramatic change look i dont have hair on my head i had hair 50 years ago
4633849 heart and soul spirit love humor dedication all those corny words we like to use happen to work for us
4633850 love is like a friendship caught on fire in the beginning a flame very pretty often hot and fierce but still only light and flickering as love grows older our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals deep burning and unquenchable
4633851 true love is eternal infinite and always like itself it is equal and pure without violent demonstrations it is seen with white hairs and is always young in the heart
4633852 the issues i sued on and won on are being exactly replicated in the situation that currently exists in your city
4633853 it is not the responsibility of women to protect themselves rapists may commit the action but the rape culture is to blame and men perpetuate it
4633854 he should have known better than to be in that neighbourhood at that time
4633855 oh thats too bad but geez what a stupid woman she had an open window oh she forgot to lock her door how could she
4633856 well never see the old entertainment days of las vegas again
4633857 corporate says that every department has to make money so you cant experiment and take chances thats the bottom line todays performers feel that they dont need las vegas to sell records or to be successful what i mean by that is that they dont have to perform a few nights at a hotel they can do a concert and thats enough or they can get paid to make an appearance at an ultra lounge and get just as much publicity
4633858 playing vegas can help an act as long as it is the right venue years ago it meant something to headline a hotel but times have changed playing the house of blues or the pearl helps most of the others places could hurt an act
4633859 weve been doing it for along time and selling it out each weekend
4633860 its certainly an easier production it also gives our patron a choice of how to spend their entertainment dollar especially with the high cost of the production show ticket this way they can afford to see one of our cirque shows and then choose from one of our many other shows
4633861 not easy finding emerging talent newer performers today play it safe by being the opening for a major concert artist so its difficult to find anyone willing to take a chance
4633862 to be fair its a question i cant answer its mind boggling and it sure beats doing risky broadway shows theyre a great marketing tool for hotels theyre the preeminent show producers with the most talented people willing to spend unbelievable amounts of money you cant ask for more
4633863 jeff i have come on spring break to have a break and just chill as i have seen what i have come to do for a week you have been doing the whole time you are a european bum
4633864 i want to be in vegas i need to be in vegas
4633865 this is in your face comedy and an all you can stand laugh fest
4633866 its a zoo around here new rules for better communication
4633867 in texas were no longer referred to as inmates but as offenders a term and label which i think is demeaning and debasing and is intended to be
4633868 by the grace of god and the prudence he has given me to exercise in this situation ive not had a disciplinary action against me in over 10 years very unusual especially for this particular unit which is known throughout the system as being a disciplinary unit nevertheless a good disciplinary record means little or nothing in this prison system be it for favorable work assignments or for pardon eligibility
4633869 why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners
4633870 the truth is i slipped by mere carelessness into saying that the enemy really loves the human
4633871 we know that he cannot really love nobody can it doesnt make sense if we could only find out what he is really up to hypothesis after hypothesis has been tried and still we cant find out yet we must never lose hope more and more complicated theories fuller and fuller collections of data cannot surely fail to succeed
4633872 how does it feel to be going to a world series game
4633873 you know what the best part of this is the cubs arent here
4633874 launched in autumn 2004 the iabc caf is produced by the international association of business communicators the global networking organisation
4633875 if youre artistic enough blackie you should totally do those
4633876 it landed on the green and skipped up the hill and i thought it was going to go over the back and it rolled straight back and dunked into the hole
4633877 i could have played a safe third shot pitch out to about five metres but i had momentum with me and it wasnt that hard a shot
4633878 i chunked it in the bunker and then didnt get up and down but it was nice to come back with birdies on 16 and 17 to end the round on a good note
4633879 im thrilled with the way im playing but you cant relax until sunday night
4633880 i knew at the beginning of the week it was going to be a low scoring week just because you have a lot of wedges eight irons and nine irons into par fours and the two par fives are very reachable
4633881 we need to improve to match it with those guys and manly our execution let us down our effort was there
4633882 they put you under pressure and they hold their nerve thats the difference between them and other sides
4633883 were not where we want to be coming to the semis but the good thing is weve got three weeks to get there so well just keep working hard and hopefully well come through
4633884 to be top of the table after 26 rounds in this tough competition is a credit to the team that does it
4633885 the minor premiership halfway through the week its forgotten its a good achievement to be in front its a tribute to that teams consistency
4633886 youd think that with young players like anderson ronaldo wayne rooney nani there will be improvement there
4633887 i think thats the most natural thing you can say about this club these players have the capacity to improve so well see
4633888 wayne is fit and the good thing he has done very well this week and has been progressing really well
4633889 we had quite a few opportunities last week that has to be said
4633890 we would have liked to have taken them and put the game to bed and if you dont take these chances in games that are close you can regret it
4633891 fortunately last week we were in control of the situation when it went to penalty kicks but we never looked as though we were going to lose it
4633892 but we have a good variety of midfield players and the back four are fit so we have a good foundation if we keep creating chances then we will start taking them
4633893 in terms of attacking options we really are down to the bare bones but we have plenty of variety in midfield and hopefully that will enough for us to get through the first hurdle
4633894 he wants to write his own tunes instead of ruining everyone elses
4633895 mark ronson needs to learn three chords on the guitar and write a tune
4633896 the monkees havent split up theyre just going under the name of the kaiser chiefs
4633897 i did drugs for 18 years and i never got that bad as to say you know what i think the kaiser chiefs are brilliant
4633898 anybody whose drummer writes the songs are not to be trusted
4633899 god almighty i have respect for sir bob stamp on her though
4633900 noel gallagher was very clearly briefed in advance and monitored during the live interview
4633901 as ever noel was a lively and opinionated guest of course radio one does not condone drug abuse and if we felt our guest was drunk we would not put him on air

4633906 we ask the media for time and privacy as we seek to deal with this tragedy which is beyond our understanding
4633907 why dont you shove you aaaa all star designation up your ass pal
4633908 remember the catch forget that i got cut by the blue jays
4633909 obviously you dont walk these guys because of the pujols factor
4633910 im the go to girl for dirty deeds done dirt cheap

4633912 one payment must be made to save on shipping with multiple items
4633913 this side of the medicine line does not belong to you
4633914 to the sioux it was a powerful rather mysterious line that could keep the u s away
4633915 it was a great victory for the sioux but it resulted in an incredible uproar from the u s public who demanded the remaining sioux be hunted down and killed
4633916 its an amazing story the relationship between walsh and the sioux
4633917 i think walsh was quite struck by the leadership of sitting bull
4633918 but what really struck me was the character of james walsh a great interesting man who was not a soldier he was cop
4633919 he wanted to help so much that he even took half the rations from his officers and gave them to the sioux
4633920 the formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in pollution fueled by riverine runoff of fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels
4633921 from 1970 to 1990 the hypoxic zone on the northwestern continental shelf of the black sea has expanded to 40 000 square kilometers 15 500 square miles
4633922 however since 1989 the loss of fertilizer subsidies from the former soviet union reduced nutrient loading by a factor of two to four with the result that by 1995 the hypoxic zone had gone
4633923 climate change also has the potential to expand naturally occurring omzs oxygen minimum zones into shallower coastal waters damaging fisheries and affecting energy flows in the same way that eutrophication driven hypoxia does
4633924 an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century before eutrophication began to spread dead zones globally
4633925 we had a lot of boys missing and credit to the boys that were out there they worked hard
4633926 hopefully next week the likes of boogaard heffernan and macallister can rejoin the squad and we can start to get stronger over the coming weeks
4633927 im going to see if i can catch a flight next week to sydney it felt great
4633928 its great to get the monkey off the back i cant remember how it went in i just know it did
4633929 overall we would have been happy to come here with the team that we had on the park and to come away with a point and its turned out that way but its hard to take after giving away a silly penalty at the end
4633930 its a team effort against those two its going to have to be
4633931 how exactly that works im not prepared to go into
4633932 its fair to say we wont expect one person to be doing the job on riewoldt the whole game
4633933 you need to help out riewoldts direct opponent because its too big a job for one guy
4633934 koschitzkes under a little bit of pressure due to a drop in form but we know hes a top line player when hes on his game
4633935 st kilda have copped a bit of criticism already this week and you always have got to be on guard and wary of that
4633936 specifically players that have been mentioned in the media from st kilda they are the ones you have to be very careful of because theyve got a lot of pride and they want to come out and prove everyone wrong
4633937 you go back and have a look at that game and see why they played badly
4633938 you dont try to emulate the way west coast play but you look at different areas of where you can possibly find that weakness
4633939 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4633940 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles 225 000 kilometres a year
4633941 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4633942 they dont have a choice to believe us we have a body
4633943 this is no time to play politics with cold war re visitation nor u s presidential politics we need russia if
4633944 president abraham lincoln had his moment with separatists states of america
4633945 russia did sell alaska to the united states under the czar of russia our relationship with russia runs deep
4633946 demands u s secretary of state condoleezza rice resign immediately

4633963 however while we wait for a final rule from cms there is much the healthcare industry can do to prepare for implementation and enjoy the benefits of using these advanced classification systems

4633980 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4633981 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4634002 it landed on the green and skipped up the hill and i thought it was going to go over the back and it rolled straight back and dunked into the hole
4634003 i could have played a safe third shot pitch out to about five metres but i had momentum with me and it wasnt that hard a shot
4634004 i chunked it in the bunker and then didnt get up and down but it was nice to come back with birdies on 16 and 17 to end the round on a good note
4634005 im thrilled with the way im playing but you cant relax until sunday night
4634006 we need to improve to match it with those guys and manly our execution let us down our effort was there
4634007 they put you under pressure and they hold their nerve thats the difference between them and other sides
4634008 were not where we want to be coming to the semis but the good thing is weve got three weeks to get there so well just keep working hard and hopefully well come through

4634017 as ever noel was a lively and opinionated guest of course radio one does not condone drug abuse and if we felt our guest was drunk we would not put him on air
4634018 we had a lot of boys missing and credit to the boys that were out there they worked hard
4634019 hopefully next week the likes of boogaard heffernan and macallister can rejoin the squad and we can start to get stronger over the coming weeks
4634020 im going to see if i can catch a flight next week to sydney it felt great
4634021 its great to get the monkey off the back i cant remember how it went in i just know it did
4634022 overall we would have been happy to come here with the team that we had on the park and to come away with a point and its turned out that way but its hard to take after giving away a silly penalty at the end
4634023 youd think that with young players like anderson ronaldo wayne rooney nani there will be improvement there
4634024 i think thats the most natural thing you can say about this club these players have the capacity to improve so well see
4634025 wayne is fit and the good thing he has done very well this week and has been progressing really well
4634026 we had quite a few opportunities last week that has to be said
4634027 we would have liked to have taken them and put the game to bed and if you dont take these chances in games that are close you can regret it
4634028 fortunately last week we were in control of the situation when it went to penalty kicks but we never looked as though we were going to lose it
4634029 but we have a good variety of midfield players and the back four are fit so we have a good foundation if we keep creating chances then we will start taking them
4634030 in terms of attacking options we really are down to the bare bones but we have plenty of variety in midfield and hopefully that will enough for us to get through the first hurdle
4634031 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4634032 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles 225 000 kilometres a year

4634035 the formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in pollution fueled by riverine runoff of fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels
4634036 from 1970 to 1990 the hypoxic zone on the northwestern continental shelf of the black sea has expanded to 40 000 square kilometers 15 500 square miles
4634037 however since 1989 the loss of fertilizer subsidies from the former soviet union reduced nutrient loading by a factor of two to four with the result that by 1995 the hypoxic zone had gone
4634038 climate change also has the potential to expand naturally occurring omzs oxygen minimum zones into shallower coastal waters damaging fisheries and affecting energy flows in the same way that eutrophication driven hypoxia does
4634039 an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century before eutrophication began to spread dead zones globally
4634040 its a team effort against those two its going to have to be
4634041 how exactly that works im not prepared to go into

4634045 st kilda have copped a bit of criticism already this week and you always have got to be on guard and wary of that
4634046 specifically players that have been mentioned in the media from st kilda they are the ones you have to be very careful of because theyve got a lot of pride and they want to come out and prove everyone wrong
4634047 you go back and have a look at that game and see why they played badly
4634048 you dont try to emulate the way west coast play but you look at different areas of where you can possibly find that weakness

4634057 everyone agrees that we need to expand the pipe which means that we can get more people across quicker more efficiently
4634058 and there is a lack of money right now maybe people pay a certain amount to come cross lets assume 5 dont hold me to that but that would then pay the bonds so we can develop infrastructure
4634059 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4634060 this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4634061 russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is no longer 1968
4634062 not only those people who perpetrated this but those who failed to stop it
4634063 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4634064 therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
4634065 poland in deploying elements of the system opens itself to a military strike that is 100 percent
4634066 we very much want the six point plan to be implemented very promptly so that russian troops are no longer in georgia outside abkhazia and south ossetia
4634067 i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off

4634083 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4634084 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4634085 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4634086 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4634100 they just dont want an area declared an orthodox jewish enclave
4634101 im hoping we can bring tolerance understanding and compassion to those who want to build an eruv
4634102 all you had to do wednesday night was substitute the word jew with black though southerners would have chosen a different term but that was the tone
4634103 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands there has to be hard bargaining
4634104 recognise the territorial integrity of georgia and recognise that abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized boundaries of georgia
4634105 i think theres truth to that i used to move every couple of years and so the opportunity to purge was always there and i often got rid of a lot id also say that in my experience a divorce is more than equal to a fire maybe

4634121 there are some good teachers at blah high school but its just not for my kid ok teachers not much education
4634122 so what do you see as the problem with public high schools
4634123 a lot of things my kid gets more freedom to do what he wants and he goes to mendocino college to take some classes plus a lot of those high school teachers lie
4634124 yeah you know im pretty conservative and most school teachers lie about whats right most teachers are liberals anyway and teach that way
4634125 i promise that hell learn something and have one of the best educational experiences of his life

4634168 if we need to add a top veteran pitcher well do that well do whatever we need to do next year well be extremely dangerous
4634169 a land resplendent with brilliant suns becoming another sky or almost a sky
4634170 we have taken the noise of gunpowder as our rhythm and the sound of machine guns as our melody
4634171 we simply chant we are from sweden we have come a long way and we are drunk
4634172 vamos a abrir una investigaci n y acudiremos a la fiscal a y a la defensor a del pueblo para dejar constancia de la manera inhumana en que la oposici n agredi a este compatriota
4634173 han sido los medios privados de oposici n los que han acudido a la comisi n internacional de derechos humanos a denunciar agravios a sus periodistas cuando son ellos oposici n quienes cometen estos actos de violencia y se ensa an contra los compatriotas con esas falsas denuncias lo que buscan es tapar sus fechor as
4634174 i cant be paid less than pavano or words to that effect and cashman understood completely mussina was then paid 11 5 million a year or slightly more than the sedentary pavano

4634187 prediction is very difficult especially if its about the future
4634188 about three fourths of all outstanding first lien mortgages were originated with a loan to value ratio of 80 percent or less and in aggregate the current loan to value ratio is estimated to be around 45 percent even though some down payments are borrowed it would take a large and historically most unusual fall in home prices to wipe out a significant part of home equity
4634189 housing price bubbles presuppose an ability of market participants to trade properties as they speculate about the future but upon sale of a house homeowners must move and live elsewhere this necessity as well as large transaction costs are significant impediments to speculative trading and an important restraint on the development of price bubbles
4634190 more likely participants in speculative trading are investors in single residence rental and second home properties but even though in recent years their share of purchases of single family homes has been growing in 2003 their mortgage originations were still less than 11 percent of total home mortgage originations
4634191 parece me que os eua precisariam ter uma raz o muito boa para romper rela es com a r ssia e voltar aos dias negros da guerra fria

4634204 the good news is due to community participation we were able to give supplies out to all the kids who came to us
4634205 i think buying school supplies really stresses families who are already on the edge further than they are accustomed to
4634206 we are working toward the same cause which is getting kids ready to be educated
4634207 it was really a natural fit to host the distribution here we were delighted to be of service
4634208 the amount of need is unprecedented in our 40 year history
4634209 people are realizing that we are providing support and that they need support
4634210 when you have to consider groceries a luxury something is wrong with the picture
4634211 the school supply distribution is an indicator for us if this is how bad things are now even more people will be coming in for thanksgiving
4634212 the very fact that bluecross blueshield capitulated so easily that doesnt say much for them as a company
4634213 at one point in society companies were more moral now we see companies leading the amoral rush to fund and subsidize and benefit so called homosexual marriages and homosexual led families
4634214 i fully believe that these two women love that child love that baby but the sad fact is that baby is growing up in a home which is intentionally fatherless by design and thats wrong
4634215 and thats going to handicap that babys life as she grows up she needs a dad and a replacement dad be it an uncle or some friend some male friend that these women have can never substitute for her having a father

4634232 average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5 and 10 so a 30 loss is deeply worrying this spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers
4634233 we dont know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality
4634234 30 fewer honeybee colonies could therefore cost the economy some 50m and put at risk the governments crusade for the public to eat five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day

4634245 the events of august 15th 1998 will forever be indelibly marked in the minds and hearts of all decent people from the moment their murder happened we have wanted to show their families and friends that we were at one with them
4634246 the dignity and courage of the families and friends of those who were murdered has with the towering response of the people of omagh shown the world that terrorism has no place in a decent world
4634247 it was a pleasant mix of taking cover then running to new cover when needed and helped capture the gun battles of the show in which the small sg teams take on outnumbering foes by the use of tactics instead of raw force we were impressed by stargate worlds and cant wait to get a chance to go through the gate again

4634250 the calls that are made from the families here for the establishment of an independent tribunal they obviously have lost all faith in the police investigation and we have seen debacle after debacle

4634252 this was a very clear attempt by whoever was behind the bomb to destroy the peace process destroy sinn feins peace strategy ten years on they have failed miserably
4634253 we know that in a flawed and broken world complete justice is hardly ever experienced
4634254 we do not live in a world where we can experience absolute justice with justice as with so many things in life we frequently have to settle for something less than the absolute it is far from easy to recognise that fact
4634255 the events of august 15 1998 will forever be indelibly marked in the minds and hearts of all decent people
4634256 from the moment their murder happened we have wanted to show their families and friends that we were at one with them
4634257 in doing so they helped all of us to appreciate in the starkest terms just how precious the opportunity was that had just been given to us to make a new beginning and how vital it was that we all worked together to turn that opportunity into reality

4634392 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4634393 once we have covered a certain area it will be marked finished nobody has to go there it is done
4634394 for the first time in over 160 years i feel that the witnesses of the franklin tragedy events have a chance to really contribute to an important search party
4634395 they were apparently cooking on the ground and they used seal oil but they used it in a way that inuit would never have used it
4634396 the incident was investigated the officer was disciplined as a result of it he no longer works for the department

4634401 from all the things that im hearing it looks like they will announce that
4634402 heathrow does not compete with gatwick and does not compete with stansted or luton or manchester
4634403 it competes with charles de gaulle in paris dubai now and amsterdams schiphol because these are big international hub airports so the ownership of the airports has nothing to do with competition
4634404 we felt there was sufficient evidence to back it up
4634405 freely sharing with him confidential proprietary and trade secret information
4634406 a jury made a decision and now we have to deal with that
4634407 in my mind it will stop the shredding of the fabric of our community we must put opportunities in front of our children so that they can go to work and earn a living
4634408 to object to what you call government welfare is your privilege but its not something i can agree with
4634409 i hope you recognize that all the people who have spoken are giving a consistent message we are united together
4634410 we followed up as many leads as we had we always considered moore a person of interest but back in 2003 we didnt have enough to make the case
4634411 the article came out in the paper and based on that we started getting new leads
4634412 this year youll see an even bigger difference because of the economy
4634413 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4634414 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4634415 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4634416 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4634417 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now
4634418 we would expect that a lot of people in the houston metro area who might have traveled further will take advantage of having great beaches and shopping on galveston island
4634419 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
4634420 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
4634421 a lot of work has been done to identify contributors to the fund and i am optimistic that it will be a success
4634422 i am confident that there will be robust sources for this funding
4634423 i was having a good time with friends we were standing waiting for others to go to the store when we felt a huge explosion
4634424 when i got up my legs were hurt there were wounded people all around
4634425 neither of the grounds put forward by the district court grounds which have been loosely characterized as government deception and outrageous conduct supports the drastic remedy of dismissal of the indictment
4634426 i heard a big explosion and a vehicle in an ethiopian convoy exploded
4634427 ethiopian soldiers in the convoy started to shoot indiscriminately i ran away but when i came back half an hour later i saw 38 people had died and 16 injured
4634428 we wanted to reach mogadishus big hospital but we are unable to pass the streets because the road is closed
4634429 we were doing a lot of work for not a lot of money and if we said anything we got fired immediately
4634430 if the votes of illegal workers are counted in union elections unions may have an incentive to encourage illegal aliens to conceal their undocumented status
4634431 every day that goes by is one day less that they have to negotiate
4634432 you are employing and taking advantage of the workers vulnerable status and then when they try to assert their rights then you use that immigration status that allowed you to exploit them to prevent them from using the courts and fighting for their rights
4634433 but for the most part international is a decent place to work the workers have been there for years it doesnt have to be like it is at agri
4634434 the supreme court petition speaks for itself as to anything else youll have to rely on the record in the case
4634435 nobody wants to lose their job and if they talk about it they are definitely going to lose their job
4634436 we cannot work any longer for 55 hours a week at straight time with no benefits and abusive treatment by our boss
4634437 i heard that whoever would sign the papers would get fired thats when i moved to get another job
4634438 if a union organizer keeps bothering you just say no
4634439 the owner is mad that the workers have chosen to be represented by a real union instead of the fake union the owner picked out and believes he can control
4634440 i decided to go on strike because i wanted a contract with more time for lunch overtime pay and proper clothing for working in the freezer
4634441 discovered that of the 21 workers who voted in the election the social security numbers of only four matched social security records with the same name
4634442 it just kind of makes sense logically that if you cant work for this employer you shouldnt be a member of the bargaining unit for this employer
4634443 here respondent is grasping at anything to deny employees the right to representation
4634444 respondent came up with this defense after it tried everything else and the union was certified
4634445 remarkably agri processors brief neither acknowledges this controlling language in sure tan nor even quotes the nlras definition of employee
4634446 the court should reconsider the central legal issue and interpret the national labor relations act in light of todays laws and todays public policies
4634447 they knew that they had illegals and that was their chance
4634448 they could have cleaned up postville too but they didnt

4634456 when the responding rcmp members arrived on the scene they found a male passenger on the bus presenting with a swollen and bloodied face
4634457 this male passenger the victim was taken to the peace river hospital he was deemed to have required specialized care for a broken nose as well as facial injuries the injured passenger was subsequently airlifted to an edmonton area treatment facility for followup and care
4634458 they didnt want to come the rest of them they wanted to stay with him because he was hurt so badly

4634488 the number of separative work units provided by an enrichment facility is directly related to the amount of energy that the facility consumes modern gaseous diffusion plants typically require 2 400 to 2 500 kilowatt hours 8 600 to 9 000 megajoules or 9 gigajoules of electricity per swu while gas centrifuge plants require just 50 to 60 kilowatt hours 180 to 220 mj of electricity per swu

4634500 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4634501 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4634502 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4634503 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4634504 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4634505 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4634506 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4634507 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
4634508 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
4634509 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing

4634524 e permitido ao homem despedir sua esposa por qualquer motivo
4634525 nunca lestes que o criador desde o in cio os fez homem e mulher 5 e disse por isso o homem deixar pai e m e e se unir sua mulher e os dois ser o uma s carne 6 de modo que eles j n o s o dois mas uma s carne portanto o que deus uniu o homem n o separe
4634526 ent o como que mois s mandou dar certid o de div rcio e despedir a mulher
4634527 mois s permitiu despedir a mulher por causa da dureza do vosso cora o mas n o foi assim desde o in cio 9 por isso eu vos digo quem despedir a sua mulher a n o ser em caso de uni o ileg tima e se casar com outra comete adult rio
4634528 se a situa o do homem com a mulher assim n o vale a pena casar se

4634539 i cant believe we are where we are in the points to be honest with you
4634540 if it werent for us having an awesome team we wouldnt be where we are as a team we know weve got to get the cars running better too
4634541 its uncharacteristic for jeff to be in this position for this long
4634542 there is no doubt that he has had a challenging season
4634543 those guys are extremely dedicated to getting it right and they will
4634544 like most of the others i was a seeker a mover a malcontent and at times a stupid hell raiser
4634545 oomph busters include not earning trust and taking people for granted
4634546 i trust all that will be happening in my life from now and my future
4634547 in this sport its never any fun if youre not winning
4634548 its been a great year and we could never really ask for more
4634549 but you hope that the success can continue and you can hope that you can have a shot for the championship when its all said and done
4634550 but youve got to have a good time while being there just being able to have the opportunity to be here is of course a dream come true for myself though its always been more fun to win
4634551 i wouldnt have moved to a team that i didnt think that they could have the same success i had at hendrick motorsports
4634552 but this much no you couldnt have thought of that but its definitely been a lot of fun
4634553 it would just escalate our point total for the start of the chase and give us a little bit easier time throughout the chase realistically though its going to be harder than it looks
4634554 its going to be pretty tough to beat jimmie johnson carl edwards and of course greg biffle is good here and matts kenseth good here
4634555 you know obviously were working really hard to keep scott in the top 35 right now and that would ensure that ryan doesnt have to do what he does best thats going out and getting front rows and poles and everything
4634556 were trying to work really hard the rest of the season to accomplish that so we dont put that pressure on ryan
4634557 thats something thats really big to the organization right now that we do everything we can to keep that 66 car in the top 35 in points let newman worry about going out and racing not worrying about going out and qualifying the first five weeks
4634558 id say were at about a c plus level as far as our on track performance
4634559 were good enough to make the chase based on how weve run week to week
4634560 if we just have another top 10 run like we ran last week eighth at watkins glen and do what we have to do well race them once we get into the chase
4634561 we just need to make sure we dont have to rely on racing our way in that last race because you never know what can happen
4634562 in a short track you can get caught up doing just about anything weve got to play it safe right now
4634563 oh yeah uh dad i dont think i will be graduating in fall

4634576 a fellow officer provided the description of this so called offender do you trust your fellow officers
4634577 with your life let me ask you this then officer do you have a room where you change your clothes in preparation for your daily duties
4634578 now why is it officer if you trust your fellow officers with your life you find it necessary to lock your locker in a room you share with these same officers
4634579 you see sir we share the building with the court complex and sometimes lawyers have been known to walk through that room
4634580 dear ex husband nothing has made my day more than receiving your letter its true that you and i have been married for seven years although a good man is a far cry from what youve been i watch my soaps so much because they drown out your constant whining and griping too bad that doesnt work i did notice when you got a hair cut last week but the first thing that came to mind was you look just like a girl since my mother raised me not to say anything if you cant say something nice i didnt comment and when you cooked my favorite meal you must have gotten me confused with my sister because i stopped eating pork seven years ago about those new silk boxers i turned away from you because the 49 99 price tag was still on them and i prayed that it was a coincidence that my sister had just borrowed fifty dollars from me that morning after all of this i still loved you and felt that we could work it out so when i hit the lotto for ten million dollars i quit my job and bought us two tickets to jamaica but when i got home you were gone everything happens for a reason i guess i hope you have the fulfilling life you always wanted my lawyer said that the letter you wrote ensures you wont get a dime from me so take care signed your ex wife rich as hell and free p s i dont know if i ever told you this but my sister carla was born carl i hope thats not a problem
4634581 sorry son but i have some bad news the donkey died

4634592 these people were defrauded of money on a faulty promise that it would improve their immigration status
4634593 they were also victims and i think part of the justice in this case was protecting people
4634594 its against policy and weve been getting in trouble for giving prices out
4634595 its agaist policy to give out gas prices over the phone
4634596 hey if were the only one that can use the
4634597 i am invisible understand simply because people refuse to see me
4634598 am i the only person who has noticed how easy perhaps even normal it is for us to travel or live in other countries and never see them or worse yet to confirm in our travels our stereotypes of the places we visit because those stereotypes were what we looked for in the surface culture in the first place
4634599 our practice in the ukraine showed clearly that the peasant problem had very different solutions from those imposed by bolshevism if our experience had spread to the rest of russia a pernicious division between country and city would not have been created years of famine would have been avoided and useless struggles between peasant and workers and what is more important the revolution would have grown and developed along very different lines we were all fighters and workers the popular assembly made the decisions in military life it was the war committee composed of delegates of all the guerrilla detachments which acted to sum up everyone took part in the collective work to prevent the birth of a managing class which would monopolise power and we were successful because we had succeeded and gave lie to bolshevik bureaucratic practices trotsky betraying the treaty between the ukraine and the bolshevik authorities sent the red army to fight us bolshevism triumphed militarily over the ukraine and at kronstadt but revolutionary history will acclaim us one day and condemn the victors as counter revolutionary grave diggers of the russian revolution
4634600 i think this is really about tapping into both online and offline

4634610 after the film got delayed zayeds dates for mission istaabul were obtained because of in between for whatever reason salman stopped shooting for yuvraj so there were chunks of zayeds unused dates which the makers of mission istaanbul used if salman hadnt shuffled around his dates for yuvraj god knows what zayed wouldve done so basically zayed shot mission on the time that salman created
4634611 shabari has been the most satisfying experience for me as an actress the film was complete long back but its release has been on hold for quite some time now it is directed by debutant director lalit marathe who has written films for ramuji like bhoot etc i am in a completely deglamorised role in this one i really feel sad that a film like this is stuck i had worked so hard on the film i did not comb my hair for days nor waxed my hands and legs i learnt how to run the flourmill since the role required me to do it i lived in the slums for few days to get the hang of the role the film has also been shot on real locations lalit had worked hard on the script of the film
4634612 i am so impressed by his work that i have been requesting him to write more such hard hitting subjects and cast me in them
4634613 govinda has sung a song for loot and when the director of the film wanted to break the news to a prominent news daily he required govindas quote in regards to the same for the article when he requested govinda for the same he flatly refused the next day this very same news paper had govinda speaking in length about his coming back to singing songs with this particular film the makers felt bad as he took on the entire credit to himself when in real it was the makers who had managed to cajole him into singing the number and not co operated when they required his assistance for the article

4634980 i was having problems with my timing but when i made a passing shot on a set point i started feeling better
4634981 i was up 5 3 in the first set and i lost my serve and then she won her serve and it was 5 5 and then were in a tiebreaker where anything can happen
4634982 if i would have had a little more focus i could have held serve and won the first set 6 3 but she has a lot of experience she was battling for every point even when she was down 5 2
4634983 i decided to just focus on every point and i started feeling better
4634984 i was able to play my game in the second set and i guess she had trouble with it
4634985 i was fighting it it still hurts ill have to get treatment on it and get ready for the u s open
4634986 i think this was my easiest match against her but i didnt exactly play my best

4634993 that is the team to beat in our sport for the past several years
4634994 i knew that they had a good car but still i was thinking it would be tough to get to whatever time we ran in practice
4634995 anytime that you can see progress and you can feel progress patience comes a lot easier
4634996 were getting there it takes time we went through a lot of growing pains but dont let anybody say we didnt work our butt off and earn it because we went through some really tough times

4635001 im kind of nervous the reason why being what we did last year as a whole unit
4635002 were going to try and come out and put points on the board because thats what the coaches ask us to do the expectations the bars set so high here not by you all and not by the fans but the coaches and the team we have high expectations for this offense and this team as a unit but what we did last year man i dont think we can really live and dwell off that

4635008 its too early to speculate about expansion elsewhere weve been very straightforward about what were doing which encompasses opening stores in northern california next year and growing within our existing areas of southern california las vegas and phoenix
4635009 it was there from the first lap the first turn

4635061 there is a powerful human impulse known as the rule of rescue to attempt to help an identifiable person whose life is in danger no matter how much it costs
4635062 evidence is not always of good quality and is hardly ever complete

4635064 sometimes at the expense of fairness and may not help in eradicating health inequalities
4635065 to help an identifiable person whose life is in danger no matter how much it costs
4635066 when there are limited resources for healthcare applying the rule of rescue may mean that other people will not be able to have the care or treatment they need
4635067 where age is an indicator of benefit as it defines quality of life or risk it can be taken into account
4635068 if the behaviour is likely to continue and can make a treatment less clinically effective or cost effective then it may be appropriate to take this into account

4635074 i work in georgetown i drive 10 minutes if that
4635075 if i come after 5 45 im driving for 45 minutes
4635076 which scene you worry about in terms of how it might be depicted in the film
4635077 i liked the brick wall inside all new cabinets it was very light and bright inside it wasnt dingy
4635078 i pretty much came with my toothbrush and i was ready to move in
4635079 if those screens are dirty its an open welcome mat
4635080 sand dust and dirt loves to hitch a ride on shoes
4635081 we go to the park all the time every afternoon
4635082 the thing i like the best is the kitchen and the bright light in the apartment
4635083 it was kind of uncomfortable what you do where you went to school if you want to live there you kind of have to sell yourself
4635084 and often there are lots of people there its a very bizarre arrangement
4635085 you can go to 10 of those without being accepted to live at one
4635086 the first year out of college its a big shock to my system anyway studios can be isolating
4635087 these draconian laws sanction the violation of due process by the state and thus contravene internationally accepted norms of jurisprudence as well as democratic governance
4635088 the chhattisgarh special public security act and unlawful activities prevention act both operate by criminalizing the very performance of civil liberties activities and culpability is decided upon not by direct proof but through guilt by association
4635089 the fast is to ensure that human rights of marginalized people are not trampled upon and human rights defenders continue to work fearlessly
4635090 a role model for the students and staff of cmc
4635091 location and proximity to work was my number one criterion
4635092 i just made the decision that there is no reason for me to live more than a few miles from work
4635093 you have to understand why its so important for us to live here in this friendly environment mainly we came here because they accepted our dog they accepted her and they adopted her she runs and plays in the house and plays with the other doggies
4635094 all the employees they all love dogs and they have dogs and they talk to our dogs they give them treats and they treat them like they are children and i am very happy with that
4635095 its really hard to find a place that allows dogs and has such a good location
4635096 its near school close to the metro and the staffs friendliness with dogs was a good sign
4635097 at the peril of being judged not to have lived
4635098 unul dintre cele mai frumoase complimente pe care le putem face este sa spunem despre o persoana ca e ambitioasa oamenii ambitiosi ne motiveaza si primesc mai mult de la viata
4635099 oamenii nu viseaza lucruri in care nu cred si pe care nu le pot implini
4635100 today so far this is our third store and we have two more to go to
4635101 we have a great relationship and theres no telling what will happen moving forward
4635102 theres no negative energy there now everybody feels positive we all feel connected
4635103 it feels really good in this economic climate for me as not only an artist but as a businessman to be able to present something to america that i know will make things a little easier for people
4635104 we have a great relationship and theres no telling what will happen moving forward
4635105 theres no negative energy there now everybody feels positive we all feel connected
4635106 it feels really good in this economic climate for me as not only an artist but as a businessman to be able to present something to america that i know will make things a little easier for people
4635107 i knew right then and there that there was going to be some serious issues but there was no getting away from it
4635108 straw this time of year is like gas i mean it goes up pretty quickly and within a minute my truck was melting down
4635109 i knew something was going to be wrong right after i went through that big flame suddenly i could feel the heat through the cab
4635110 if the caps wouldnt have exploded off the tanks it could have been a big boom
4635111 the way it was exploding and blowing off the road im sure it didnt help at all not at all
4635112 thats my blood and tears and everything put into it its all gone
4635113 id say on a scale of one to 10 trying to sell it how difficult it is its probably a 10
4635114 if you look on the blue book its about 20 percent less than where it should be
4635115 and whenever you have a situation where the new ones have large incentives that creates pressure on the used vehicle price also
4635116 we have definitely had reduction in prices in all that stuff
4635117 whether its new or used theres a better value in an suv today than six months ago
4635118 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4635119 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4635120 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4635121 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4635122 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4635123 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4635124 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4635125 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4635126 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4635127 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4635128 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4635129 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4635130 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4635131 we dont have in our terms of agreement that if you miss a day you get a credit
4635132 we just do that voluntarily because its the right thing to do
4635133 so anytime something like this happens you risk hurting that brand and that can end up hurting you in the long term
4635134 from our point of view its really a non event
4635135 a lot of work has been done to identify contributors to the fund and i am optimistic that it will be a success
4635136 i am confident that there will be robust sources for this funding
4635137 the agreed figure is more than sufficient to deal with the claims
4635138 this is coming into fruition after a great deal of work and i look forward to going to libya as well
4635139 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4635140 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4635141 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4635142 i think thats the most natural thing you can say about this club these players have the capacity to improve so well see
4635143 wayne is fit and the good thing he has done very well this week and has been progressing really well
4635144 we had quite a few opportunities last week that has to be said
4635145 we would have liked to have taken them and put the game to bed and if you dont take these chances in games that are close you can regret it
4635146 fortunately last week we were in control of the situation when it went to
4635147 but we have a good variety of midfield players and the back four are fit so we have a good foundation if we keep creating chances then we will start taking them
4635148 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4635149 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4635150 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4635151 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

4635153 berbatov is a fabulous player who would be a fine addition to any team
4635154 the thing is if manchester united sign a player it has to be a top player and that would be exciting for us all
4635155 arsenal had a great run last season until they got injuries in march while liverpool have signed robbie keane and one or two others
4635156 but chelsea are the most experienced and they might be our biggest threat
4635157 we dont need to get much better to achieve what we did last season but the challenge for us is to improve
4635158 you would think with young players like anderson cristiano ronaldo wayne rooney and nani we have the capacity to do that
4635159 i am expecting a natural progression and there is no doubt in my mind this team will win championships long after i have left
4635160 robbies done well his last game was october last year thats a long time ago hes trained ever so well and hes getting his sharpness back
4635161 some of the things hes done in the last three or four days in training have been mind blowing
4635162 russian aggression against georgia is both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance to the united states of america
4635163 if your not writing lots of articles submitting videos writing press releases recording podcasts then you might as well

4635166 my gosh its convenient i just drop my car off and then walk over and pick it up
4635167 im a big pool and summer person so the fact that they have a pool now was a major bonus the whole property seems a lot nicer
4635168 my dad was a yachtsman he raced for a number of years
4635169 its pretty easy to meet people most of the neighbors are really nice down to earth people its a good mix of people with kids young professionals and people like me just starting out
4635170 there are not a lot of places that will accept large dogs plus theres lots of room for me to let him run

4635175 the landlords going to be concerned about the damage that your pet is going to do

4635181 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4635182 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4635183 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4635184 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4635185 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4635186 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4635187 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4635188 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4635189 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4635190 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4635191 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4635192 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4635193 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4635194 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4635195 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4635196 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4635197 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4635198 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4635199 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4635200 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4635201 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4635202 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4635203 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4635204 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4635205 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4635206 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4635207 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4635208 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4635276 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

4635278 fantacy hole they had frickin small holes in the wall use your imagination im not sayin it lol there was a local preacher man that just happen to be in there at the time of the bust

4635282 havent made it all the way to the ultimate lender
4635283 you werent buying a house you were buying a package
4635284 they werent disclosing any of this that was on separate paper that was pulled
4635285 these incentives did not reflect standard corporate practice and once discovered the practice was immediately halted
4635286 youre basically getting banks to give you a cash advance
4635287 it was more sales agents in the model home saying look tell me what you need and i got a lot of money to play with
4635288 its a phantom incentive to mask it in an excessive loan
4635289 they didnt care what you did with the money as long as the buyer paid the price they wanted for the house
4635290 she was truly powerful in being the visual face of what mental illness looks like it doesnt have two heads or worts on its face or drool down its mouth it looks like a typical child

4635295 we are delighted that heather will now be available free for all pupils in scotland most windows and apple computers already have one or two computer voices installed on them but the voices are quite robotic and usually have an american accent
4635296 better computer voices are supplied with some commercial text to speech programs but they usually have very english accents and of course schools and
4635297 the new scottish voice sounds great and is free it means that pupils can listen to for example scottish digital exams being read out in a scottish voice as far as we know the scottish qualifications authority is the first exam board to offer digital exams for pupils with additional support needs and with the launch of heather i believe we have another first
4635298 what i cant hear you over the barking of the dogs theyre a little protective

4635327 i have always been an individual interested in my community
4635328 when he got up to speak it was like you were electrifying an audience because everybody sat down and they were so still and listened to him
4635329 she say look here maw maw youre going right where im studying and she said why cant i go
4635330 when i was invited to reprint in book form the articles which had appeared in the
4635331 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4635332 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4635333 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4635334 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4635335 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4635336 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4635337 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4635338 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4635339 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4635340 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4635341 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4635342 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4635343 who are open to doing something on the production side
4635344 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4635345 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4635346 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

4635362 it is true that kareena was offered a role in chamera which is to be directed by daniel silverman but she has not signed on the dotted lines
4635363 besides chamera kareena was also offered two other hollywood films which i cannot divulge much into
4635364 ive often wondered why i havent directed a film so far and the only answer i can come up with is sheer laziness
4635365 javed has written his first script since farhans lakshya for me thats taken care of now i need to get the cast in place sadly theres no place for shabana or my wife in my film
4635366 yes there is a problem between katrina and me but there could be reasons for that it could be because of our boyfriends john abraham and salman khan but that never affected our work we didnt speak during race but that never stopped us from shooting i could walk up to kareena and do that but no i cant do that with katrina there is awkwardness between katrina and me we dont talk to each other

4635371 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4635372 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4635373 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4635374 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4635375 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4635376 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4635377 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4635378 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4635379 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4635380 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4635381 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4635382 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4635383 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4635384 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4635385 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4635386 were in a difficult situation but our government is helping us
4635387 you know i am very ashamed we dont have a kopeck left and im so hungry
4635388 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4635389 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4635390 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4635391 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4635392 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4635393 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4635394 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4635395 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4635396 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4635397 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4635398 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4635399 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4635400 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

4635412 therefore since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us
4635413 the beslan hostage tragedy has the potential to spark upheaval across the caucasus political analysts in moscow are saying some influential commentators warn the kremlin must alter its security approach toward the region however president vladimir putin appears intent on tightening russias security apparatus rather than reexamining existing policies
4635414 we failed to react appropriately to them and instead displayed weakness and the weak are beaten
4635415 by using a secondary processor with its own linux based os the primary cpu is bypassed for instant access to a variety of functions think blackberry style contacts calendar email that kind of stuff opened up directly on your laptop without firing up the whole system the dedicated sub system should also preserve battery life by avoiding the power drain of larger applications
4635416 its something that we have wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4635417 i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights
4635418 and its great because we just kind of were moving forward were not looking back
4635419 since its so fresh i think it definitely took a toll on our enrollment this year no doubt about it
4635420 our staff is especially upbeat very very talented very very energized focuses on kids focuses on learning
4635421 we need to redouble our efforts to be effective with our kids reach out to parents and assure everybody within our learning community that this is in fact a great place for kids
4635422 this is the first real school where ive come to where its a very strange feeling when your teachers are your friends you know your best friends
4635423 despite all thats happened i believe most of the kids really want to push forward and see what this school can be put to because we havent seen our full potential yet
4635424 its affirming and validates the thing we stand for and our determination to move this organization from good to great
4635425 i feel confident that after the school year people will have a different perception of our school
4635426 i knew i was taking a gamble by coming back trying to be here and pushing my leg
4635427 but they were calculated risks because i was never running through pain
4635428 if youre not in the race you cant win the race by getting myself to this point i have put myself in as good a position as i could have done
4635429 i am glad i pushed it at every opportunity there were times when it was really hard and having got this far gives me a mental lift going into the race
4635430 i am just looking forward now to getting in the race and getting on with it
4635431 i know it is going to be tough and i am going to fight harder than i have ever fought out there but i am looking forward to it
4635432 i have fought harder than i have ever fought to get to this point so i just want to go in there and do everything justice and everyone justice
4635433 ideally i would have done a lot more running but i have not been able to do that i have done what i have been able to do she said
4635434 i cannot go into it with any regrets of i wish i had done this or i wish i had done that
4635435 when you take any gamble you have to weigh up what is the worst that can happen and are you okay to live with that and if i look back over the last 12 weeks i dont think there was any point where i could have done any more than i have done
4635436 obviously i could have done with more time when your biggest week of actual running is two weeks before the race is not an ideal preparation and it is not what you would risk going into any other race
4635437 but the olympic games is not a race which i ever want to watch on television and think what i could have done you get in there and give it your best shot
4635438 no it is something that is just very important to me it is important to any athlete she added
4635439 it is important for me to go out there and run well but i do not think it is the defining moment of my career
4635440 we are the music makers and we are the dreamers of the dreams

4635443 the messenger of allaah saws was dozing and then he raised his head and smiled then either he said to them the companions or they said to him
4635444 it is a river granted to me by my lord the almighty the all powerful in paradise in which is great goodness its drinking vessels are as limitless as the heavenly bodies
4635445 you know nothing of the innovations in religion that he introduced after you
4635446 i entered paradise and i came to a river whose banks had tents made of pearls and i thrust my hand into its flowing water and found that it was the strongest smell of musk
4635447 this is al kauthar which allah the mighty and majestic has given you
4635448 it is a river in paradise which my lord has given me it is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey there are birds in it whose necks are long like camels
4635449 its meat is more delicate and tender than that o umar
4635450 but people say that it is a river in paradise
4635451 the river in paradise is from the blessings bestowed by allaah upon him saws
4635452 it is the abundant blessings of this world and the hereafter
4635453 al kawthar is a river in paradise its banks are of gold and silver and its bed is of precious stones and pearls and its water is whiter than snow and sweeter than honey
4635454 leave him for he is a man who is cut off and is of no consequence and if he were killed he would be forgotten
4635455 you are their leader i e the people of makkah do you not see this weak feeble despised man who is without family or any who might help him and who is cut off from his own people he claims that he is better than we we are the people of the house of the pilgrims the custodians of the ka bah the suppliers of water to the pilgrims
4635456 when his sons die he will no longer be remembered
4635457 what sort of deeds in or what qualities of islam are good
4635458 to feed the poor and greet those whom you know and those whom you dont know
4635459 perhaps you could take the shawl of your servant and give him another less expensive one
4635460 for i once had a servant whose mother was not arab and i insulted him and his mother that servant went to the messenger of allah saws complaining of the words i had said
4635461 when rasul allaah saws saw me he commented o abu dharr you are a man who still has jahilliyyah in him
4635462 o you who believe let not one group of people make fun of another perhaps the ones being made fun of are better than them and let not women make fun of other women perhaps the woman being made fun of is better than them and do not insult one another and do not call each other by offensive nicknames wretched is the name i e mention of disobedience after ones faith and whoever does not repent then it is those who are the dhaalimoon the wrongdoers
4635463 verily a person will speak words from those that allah hates paying no heed to what he is saying and with those words he will plummet in to the hellfire
4635464 verily those people that make fun of people for them a gate of jannah will be opened it will be said to them come and enter that person will come with all their anguish and depression but when he gets close the gate will be closed in his face then another gate to jannah will be opened and it will be said come and enter so that person comes with all his anguish and depression but when he gets close the gate will be closed in his face this will keep happening to him until it gets to the point where it will be said come and enter and he will not come from the despair of ever entering paradise
4635465 is it allah and his verses and his messenger that you were mocking
4635466 indeed those that committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed
4635467 those who criticize the contributers among the believers concerning their charities and criticize the ones who find nothing to spend except their effort so they ridicule them allah will ridicule them and they will have a painful punishment
4635468 o you who believe let not one group of people make fun of another
4635469 it is enough sin for a person that they would ridicule their muslim brother
4635470 by allah whom there is no god but he there is nothing more worthy of a prolonged incarceration then ones tongue
4635471 those whom the other muslims are safe from his tongue and hands
4635472 and if an evil suggestion comes to you from satan then seek refuge in allah indeed he is hearing and knowing
4635473 and whoever does not repent then it is those who are the dhaalimoon the wrongdoers
4635474 quickly send with me someone who can squeeze through and fight the army on the inside until he has opened the gates for all of us to enter
4635475 i have news of the soldier that entered the hole
4635476 he has three conditions before exposing himself do you agree to this
4635477 the first is that you do not try to compensate him for what he did the second is that you do not tell anyone who he is and the third is that you shall not ask for his presence ever again do you agree to these conditions
4635478 it is i i went through that hole only for the sake of allah
4635479 o allah on the day of resurrection grant me companionship with the soldier of the hole
4635480 indeed my prayer my rites of sacrifice my living and my dying are for allah lord of the worlds
4635481 it is those deeds which are most correct and most sincere
4635482 o abu ali what are deeds that are correct and sincere
4635483 if a deed is done sincerely yet is not done correctly it will not be accepted and if a deed is done correctly but not sincerely for allah it will not be accepted it must be done sincerely and correctly sincerely as in for allah alone correctly as in accordance to the sunnah
4635484 we feed you only for the countenance of allah we wish no reward from you nor gratitude
4635485 perhaps a great deed is belittled by an intention and perhaps a small deed by a sincere intention is made great
4635486 the sincere one is he who hides his good deeds in the same way that he would hide his bad
4635487 at this moment pray to only god and pray sincerely for your gods cannot avail us in any way through salvation from this storm
4635488 by allah if ikhlaas can only save me on the sea then on land nothing but it can save me
4635489 o allah if you save me you have upon me an oath that i shall not rest until i arrive at muhammad saws and place my hand in his
4635490 if your intention is one of these three do not seek knowledge to shame the ignorant or to argue with the fuqahaa or to cause people to turn their faces in your direction intend with your actions and words that which is with allah for indeed that which is with allah shall remain and everything else shall perish
4635491 deeds without sincerity are like a traveller who carries dirt in his water jug the carrying of it burdens him and it brings no benefit
4635492 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4635493 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4635494 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4635495 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4635496 i am the rabbit i am the rabbit i swear
4635497 i dont know anything about asis so either they do a good job of keeping their activity secret or there really isnt anything to do for intelligence in australia
4635498 csis always has a booth when our university or student union does job fairs and similar activities its actually kind of sad though they do tend to attract more traffic than your average summer house painting gig whether our espionage service should be competing with such outlets is another question
4635499 what about the a team putting an end to jibba jabba one fool at a time

4635770 we broke ground with this project in december and now were getting ready for open house in two weeks in august
4635771 our mission with this project is when a youngster grows up here they can feel proud of where theyre living and take pride of having their own home
4635772 we havent really had any major problems with vandalism and or theft
4635773 right now we have guards at lacey estates to make certain everything is okay until the project is complete
4635774 mr mathers worked very hard if theres going to be a success out there hes the guy

4635776 will something be done ahead of the second leg certainly yes but before saturday no
4635777 if you look at the number of players we had out you can say it was very positive for us
4635778 we did not have abou diaby cesc fabregas tomas rosicky samir nasri kolo toure eduardo da silva and philippe senderos while alex song is at the olympics
4635779 we missed seven or eight players out so for me our squad looks big because the players who were here did well
4635780 it isnt that type of occasion i keep saying that i want us to be recognized for the achievements weve had and we deserve to be in the premier league
4635781 im not into the theory of us just going an enjoying the day
4635782 the team know they have to improve and i did not have to say much to them in the dressing room sometimes you do not need many words
4635783 the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
4635784 a case of the nerves both at the plate and on the mound
4635785 these guys are more nervous now than they were on the baseball field i promise
4635786 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4635787 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4635788 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4635789 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4635790 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4635797 everyone agrees that we need to expand the pipe which means that we can get more people across quicker more efficiently
4635798 and there is a lack of money right now maybe people pay a certain amount to come cross lets assume 5 dont hold me to that but that would then pay the bonds so we can develop infrastructure

4635814 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
4635815 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
4635816 we looked on the schedule today to time our lunch to be able to come down and watch the boys play its obviously a great accomplishment for a small town like rapid city to get to williamsport its a great accomplishment for the kids and we just want to support them
4635817 absolutely little old rapid city little old south dakota number 8 teams from the united states in it and were one of them thats a pretty big deal
4635818 little rough start there but theyll bounce back and depending on what happens today theyve still got two more games to go the kidsll do very well and as long as they know the people and the city of rapid city are very proud of them regardless of the outcome they should be very proud of themselves
4635819 i dont think right now they really realize that but my admonishment to them would be to cherish the moment play hard and go for it
4635820 when you put a whole bunch of kids together in a very small confined space theyre very likely to share a lot of germs with each other
4635821 most younger kids dont have good hygiene so they dont wash their hands well after going to the bathroom they touch their face they sneeze into their hands and touch things and its very easy to spread germs
4635822 if theyre over tired they tend to get sick a little easier
4635823 its not that they cant afford school supplies its that they cant afford everything else that goes along with the beginning of school the new shoes the gym clothes band fees book fees and lunch money are all needed when school starts
4635824 ive talked to many parents moms and dads whove called and said theyve just never needed this before and they dont even know where to turn or what to do
4635825 the smiles are infectious because the children are so grateful theyre excited ready to start school they get a backpack and unzip it instantly theyre in the parking lot and theyre dumping it out because theyre so excited to get their new school supplies
4635826 i guess the little kids are going to be excited they get to choose their own bag you know pick out what they like
4635827 theres people moving in furniture at the same time theyre finishing up some of the construction work here
4635828 last year when we set our calendar we realized we would be very tight
4635829 so we pushed the start back probably a week from what we wouldve done
4635830 that put us back a little then we had some crazy weather this year that stopped a lot of our construction progress
4635831 when all is said and done it is each of you making thousands of decisions every single day who will determine how effective these steps will be

4635840 the first wal mart location in north america with a collective agreement in place
4635841 at first glance this will have a significant impact on our business model which is to offer the best prices to our clientele
4635842 the employer does not want to modify his business model this is likely the reason why negotiations stalled and why the parties could not reach a deal at the end of the first labor agreement
4635843 the formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in pollution fueled by riverine runoff of fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels
4635844 from 1970 to 1990 the hypoxic zone on the northwestern continental shelf of the black sea has expanded to 40 000 square kilometers 15 500 square miles
4635845 however since 1989 the loss of fertilizer subsidies from the former soviet union reduced nutrient loading by a factor of two to four with the result that by 1995 the hypoxic zone had gone
4635846 climate change also has the potential to expand naturally occurring omzs oxygen minimum zones into shallower coastal waters damaging fisheries and affecting energy flows in the same way that eutrophication driven hypoxia does
4635847 an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century before eutrophication began to spread dead zones globally
4635848 they believed that this place was the entrance to xibalba that is why we have found the offerings there
4635849 i knew coming into the season regardless of what my performance was that this was going to be my last season

4635866 people with blinders will insist that this is white even if it is black
4635867 she strongly believes there must be reform in the constitution to downscale the authority of the central government
4635868 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4635869 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4635887 now we have a situation in which technology products are going to be appearing in the marketplace that were not developed or commercialized here we wont have had any involvement with them and may not even know they are coming
4635888 china has really changed the world economic landscape in technology
4635889 when you take chinas low cost manufacturing and focus on technology then combine them with the increasing emphasis on research and development the result ultimately wont leave much room for other countries
4635890 china is nowhere close to becoming a world financial center
4635891 dramatic economic growth must continue indefinitely a prospect about which there are grounds for skepticism
4635892 chinas rise further depends critically on the continuation of such economic growth rates and there are reasons to wonder how long the spectacular rates of the past 25 years can continue
4635893 the high proportion of chinas economy occupied by its exports makes it sensitive to the ups and downs of the international economy generally and to the engine of american consumption in particular
4635894 the u s isnt going to disintegrate into a backwater economy
4635895 but if you scan the contributing factors to technology driven economic prominence the chinese upside is far greater they are educating more scientists and engineers their government puts a high priority on technical capability and entrepreneurial activity if you look at our educational system especially k 12 our investment savings rate debt and so on prospects are scary

4635946 princess cruises has long stood for romance and reconnection and so were delighted to have trista and ryan christen ruby princess as they celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary

4635952 we realized that if you could re imagine customer support as a community conversation between users and the company
4635953 rather than as an overloaded and understaffed call center all sorts of good things will happen

4636000 the formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in pollution fueled by riverine runoff of fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels
4636001 from 1970 to 1990 the hypoxic zone on the northwestern continental shelf of the black sea has expanded to 40 000 square kilometers 15 500 square miles
4636002 however since 1989 the loss of fertilizer subsidies from the former soviet union reduced nutrient loading by a factor of two to four with the result that by 1995 the hypoxic zone had gone
4636003 climate change also has the potential to expand naturally occurring omzs oxygen minimum zones into shallower coastal waters damaging fisheries and affecting energy flows in the same way that eutrophication driven hypoxia does
4636004 an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century before eutrophication began to spread dead zones globally

4636017 talks are under way and many people are interested that the issue be settled amicably without going into the impeachment of president pervez musharraf
4636018 the impeachment process which can last months will be very damaging especially for the countrys economy
4636019 the purpose of these talks is to settle the issue and there are many other options under consideration
4636020 the denials mean no more than that musharraf is holding out for a deal and that he doesnt want to create the impression that hes caved in and is on his way out

4636025 the issue of energy security is our number one national security threat our number one environmental threat and our number one economic opportunity we need a complete generational commitment to energy independence and we must be committed to making the 5th district this nations leader in alternative energy
4636026 goode has never voted for an energy plan that wouldnt make the gas companies more money he has 200 000 personally invested in oil and gas companies he has taken over 100 000 in contributions from big energy and big oil and every single one of his votes makes them more money
4636027 this is another area where i have not sat on the sidelines ive been working since 2006 to ask the right questions we need people who understand how to fix this war every single person in washington has failed on this issue i will stand up to any democrat or republican who continues to fail to push toward peace in iraq
4636028 i dont agree with the premise that the united states has a bad health care system i also contest 45 million uninsured people there are about 12 to 15 million persons in the country illegally and most of them dont have health insurance and we can reduce that figure significantly if they werent in the united states
4636029 anyone who thinks the healthcare system in america is working is probably on the kind of healthcare that members of congress get instead of the healthcare that the rest of us get

4636048 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4636049 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4636050 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4636051 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4636052 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4636057 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4636058 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4636059 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4636060 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4636061 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4636062 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4636064 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4636065 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4636066 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4636067 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche

4636069 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4636070 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4636071 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4636072 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4636073 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4636074 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4636075 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4636076 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

4636078 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4636079 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4636080 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4636081 the list of artists and contributors who have graced the pages of arkitip now reads like a whos who of popular culture many of which received exposure in arkitip long before the mainstream took notice
4636082 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4636083 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4636084 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4636085 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4636086 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4636087 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4636088 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4636089 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4636090 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4636091 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4636092 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4636093 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4636094 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

4636098 watching from afar with lebron he handles the ball a lot
4636099 i think that i can take a load off of him handling the ball at times hes a guy that kind of sets his teammates up a lot i think i can relieve him from that that will help him as far as being a little fresher at the end of the season
4636100 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4636101 sundin is way better then all of those guys why wouldnt you do that
4636102 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4636103 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4636104 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4636105 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4636106 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4636107 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4636108 didnt you guys develop this more and do your homework
4636109 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4636110 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4636111 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4636112 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4636113 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4636114 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4636115 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4636116 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4636117 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4636118 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4636119 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4636120 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4636121 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4636122 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4636123 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4636124 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4636125 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4636126 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4636127 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4636128 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4636129 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4636130 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4636131 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4636132 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4636133 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4636134 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4636135 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4636136 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
4636137 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4636138 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4636139 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4636140 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4636141 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4636142 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4636143 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4636144 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4636145 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4636146 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4636147 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4636148 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4636149 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4636150 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4636151 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4636152 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4636153 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4636154 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4636155 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4636156 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4636157 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4636158 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4636159 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4636160 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4636161 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4636162 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4636163 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4636164 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4636165 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4636166 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4636167 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4636168 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4636169 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4636170 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
4636171 it is time to revive the moral argument for protecting a womans right to choose abortion is about the value of womens lives
4636172 the democratic platform of 2008 offers an opportunity to put an end to this self destructive cycle of safe legal and rare otherwise known as regret depression and self denigration in its place it can finally argue for the value of womens lives
4636173 doesnt see this as a modification of the partys pro choice stance rather its a strengthening of that position and a re articulation of the commitment to helping low income expectant mothers
4636174 the democratic party is planning a convention designed to soften the edges on the partys support for abortion rights
4636175 the democratic party is going to add and change some abortion language in their platform as an attempt to bring more moderate evangelicals and pro life catholics into the party
4636176 the brody file is told that people like pastor joel hunter registered republican jim wallis president of sojourners pastor tony campolo and conservative catholic legal scholar doug kmiec all helped in the drafting of this new language
4636177 smartly links bushs attempt to further restrict access to abortion with simultaneous attempts by his partys extremist right wing to deny a woman access to birth control
4636178 another dangerous feature of the proposed rules is that they redefine contraception as abortion
4636179 there is no evidence that a single abortion causes significant mental health problems
4636180 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
4636181 will terminate the life of a whole separate unique living human being
4636182 her existing constitutional rights with regards to that relationship will be terminated
4636183 ive seen it all theres nothing that would surprise me anymore
4636184 the policy of placing a restraint on a woman while in a hospital bed is unequivocally related to a penological goal and is not constitutionally excessive
4636185 her experience does not rise to the level of unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain
4636186 saw iraqi soldiers come into the hospital with guns they took the babies out of the incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor

4636190 more black americans are infected with hiv than the total populations of people living with hiv in seven of the 15 countries served by pepfar
4636191 were black america a separate country it would elicit major concern and extensive assistance from the u s government instead the national response to aids among black americans has been lethargic and often neglectful

4636195 but allowing superdelegates to determine the outcome of our nominating process while 366 pledged delegates elected by more than 2 million democrats in michigan and florida remain unseated is especially undemocratic
4636196 fortunately we do have another more democratic choice we can choose to enfranchise democrats in florida and michigan thereby increasing the likelihood that voters not politicians or party elders will determine who faces sen john mccain in the fall
4636197 a decision was announced that has had a catastrophic impact on the poor and powerless around the world on july 25 1968 pope paul vi slammed the door on the hopes of the vast majority of catholics and confirmed a complete prohibition on modern methods of contraception the papal encyclical humanae vitae was a defining moment in modern church history and continues to be a source of great conflict and division in the church it is a little known fact that before humanae vitae was released the hand picked vatican birth control commission voted overwhelmingly to recommend that the church rescind its ban on artificial contraception however the pope rejected that recommendation and today the rupture that humanae vitae caused between the vatican and lay catholics remains
4636198 it is well known that catholics particularly those in the global north have ignored this ban it is time for them to speak out and say enough is enough we need catholics to pick up the telephone or send an e mail to their local bishop saying that it is time to change church policy less privileged people who often only have access to health care through catholic run facilities or live in countries where the catholic hierarchy has considerable influence over public policy are dying as a result of the ban
4636199 it will also continue to be the most widely flouted injunction of the church at the level of practice

4636219 we started them because we had friends who were big fans of frosting but not necessarily cake
4636220 we started doing frosting shooters with friends and then we put it on the menu for 75 cents who doesnt love frosting
4636221 its kind of the cut to the chase evolution of cupcakes
4636222 i can imagine it being at parties its a great thing to have at an office party it provides just a little bite of sweetness and yumminess without going whole hog
4636223 we have a lot of regulars who know which flavors we offer on what day and theyll come in on saturdays because they know thats the day we have raspberry buttercream
4636224 i see fingers getting involved but theres no shame we dont judge here at sprinkles
4636225 you order the cupcake but you really want the frosting
4636226 it brings you back to when you used to lick the container or whatever your mom made it in
4636227 this is like a classic food trend a lot of people are thinking of the same thing at the same time which is really how most food things start
4636228 were not talking molecular gastronomy its kind of reducing down to the basic element of what a cupcake is
4636229 it really became a big thing i tried to stop offering them
4636230 but i would see people on the street and theyd be like where are the frosting shots they would get on my case about that
4636231 we tried to think of what we could do why would people come in the evening they tend to come during the day and could go somewhere else and have a cocktail
4636232 i think its the connotation of its a shot and what in the world is it people are just curious
4636233 we cant solve problems but well spend your money trying to figure out how

4636240 a national study of over 1 800 married couples indicated that the probability of getting a divorce was twice as high for couples who had cohabited prior to marriage compared to those couples who had not in addition cohabitation prior to marriage related to lower levels of subsequent marital interaction and higher levels of marital disagreement and instability
4636241 a study using a nationally representative sample of 1 235 women ages 20 37 indicated that married women who had cohabited prior to marriage were 3 3 times more likely to have sex with someone other than their husband than married women who had not cohabited prior to marriage
4636242 so then if you are living with someone outside of marriage i suggest you move out and start over the two of you may still make it work but if you cant make it work outside of the marriage without being sexually active odds are that the marriage will soon fall apart anyway

4636248 its practically impossible to look at a penguin and feel angry
4636249 if a small thing has the power to make you angry does that not indicate something about your size
4636250 for every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness
4636251 resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die
4636252 do not teach your children never to be angry teach them how to be angry
4636253 always write angry letters to your enemies never mail them

4636257 anger repressed can poison a relationship as surely as the cruelest words
4636258 anger ventilated often hurries towards forgiveness anger concealed often hardens into revenge

4636273 allow this center in man to remain dulled by the crowd allow it to continue dissipated by busyness permit it to go on evading its function by a round of distractions or to lull itself by a carefully chosen rotation of pleasures abandon it to its attempt to drug to narcotize suffering and remorse which might reveal to it its true condition let it wither away the sense of its own validity by false theories of mans nature of his place in the social pattern of his way of salvation in short allow any of these well known forms of domestication of mans responsible core as an individual to continue unchallenged and you as a thinker and a friend of men have committed the supreme treason
4636274 man is to be saved by identification with a set of external arrangements this for kierkegaard is the ulitmate blasphemy for instead of heightening his core of responsibility and integrity man is invited to do what he is already enamored with doing to join the crowd the mass to be dissolved into the organic whole to become a set of relations within the whole is all to congenial to modern man kierkegaard believed
4636275 for he believed the crowd the mass to be a hiding place in which the individual may abdicate his true quest for inward intensity and responsibility the crowd is a sink of cowardice in which individuals are relieved of individual responsibility and will commit acts they would never dare to do alone
4636276 the mass flatters the mass excuses the mass condemns the mass counts heads the mass pronounces on truth and in all these things the mass for kierkegaard is that which is false and debasing

4636357 i grew up believing an evangelical couldnt be a democrat
4636358 when you look at the political party that has traditionally championed poverty social justice and care for the least of these its not been the republican party
4636359 we are to honor the least of these above even ourselves its very difficult to reconcile totally
4636360 i dont think any young evangelical is ignoring the traditional values issues but they are adding other issues including poverty and war and they are also looking at integrity and family

4636376 dan bersabarlah kamu sesungguhnya janji allah adalah benar dan sekali kali janganlah orang orang yang tidak meyakini kebenaran ayat ayat allah itu menggelisahkan kamu
4636377 sesungguhnya besarnya pahala itu sesuai dengan besarnya ujian jika allah mencintai suatu kaum maka allah akan menguji mereka maka barangsiapa yang dengan rela menerimanya maka baginya kerelaan itu dan barangsiapa yang benci maka baginya kebencian itu

4636414 but more often concern about his emerging overconfidence which is making it difficult to interact with him
4636415 you get a sense they are concerned that the al maliki regime has an inflated sense of his power
4636416 he is successfully fashioning himself as an iraqi hero who kicked the americans out that makes him difficult to negotiate with
4636417 theres even some evidence that al maliki wants to start a fight with the sons of iraq
4636418 al maliki doesnt believe he has to accommodate these people he will only do it if we twist his arm to the breaking point

4636436 we have learnt from western tv how to simplify the narrative
4636437 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4636438 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4636439 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4636440 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4636441 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure
4636442 whatever is going to get him to have some sleep tonight then thats fine
4636443 it was really one or two points and who played those one or two points better
4636444 im happy because the worst thing that can happen is im going to have all the medals
4636445 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4636446 we tried some things during practice that didnt work at all
4636447 so we went back to where we were and i think thats one of the best qualifying cars ive ever had it was a heck of a lap
4636448 im very proud of everybody at red bull racing and toyota
4636449 we picked up speed from practice but i just knew in the car it wasnt the fastest lap
4636450 and i think for that red bull team and brian this has been a track that fits their style hell be ever more of a threat come race time
4636451 its the team to beat in our sport for the last several years
4636452 to lay that lap down in practice and back it up in qualifying thats a really good feeling
4636453 really unbelievable i wish we could take that and apply it to every week but its not that easy
4636454 but anytime you can see progress feel progress patience comes easier
4636455 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats
4636456 democrats work for a living and they have to work and take care of their families and they say these are open to those in the community so they shouldnt ask people to drop everything in their lives for this
4636457 its not fair its elitist and they need to practice what theyre preaching
4636458 everyone agrees that we need to expand the pipe which means that we can get more people across quicker more efficiently
4636459 and there is a lack of money right now maybe people pay a certain amount to come cross lets assume 5 dont hold me to that but that would then pay the bonds so we can develop infrastructure

4636464 without a doubt im going to feel odd playing against america one of the reasons that i no longer wanted to play in mexico was so that i wouldnt have to face them in saying that im now with fc dallas and were playing them in a friendly and we hope that its a fun event for the public instead of a strong rivalry it will be good to see many teammates and friends that i left there and well try to make it a good game so that fans enjoy it and leave happy

4636469 this military is telling president pervez musharraf please step down and avoid further humiliation for yourself and also for the army
4636470 the military has probably concluded that president musharraf staying on as the president will only cause more divisions in pakistan
4636471 in public we say the military must remain neutral but in private we all know the military is a powerful player and they have to be on board
4636472 even if by some luck president musharraf survives and carries on the military wants to make clear that it would have no re sponsibility for that outcome
4636473 poles and poland want to take part in military alliances in which we are assured of our security from the first moment of the conflict
4636474 poland will no longer be in the sphere which is not directly defended
4636475 he will be a very very good fullback his junior and senior year but i want to see if hes ready to be a really good fullback as a sophomore
4636476 hes got an awful lot of what you want in a fullback especially from a ball carrying standpoint
4636477 and hes one of those guys where it carries forth to the football field ive seen guys that are splendid in the weight room and when you time them but it doesnt always translate where with him theres clearly a carry over
4636478 hes a really smart player and he picks things up right off the bat
4636479 then the other part is i just like to see how quickly a guy can get lined up and get a play called and go because i think tempos got to be an ally for us this season
4636480 really really good player but for the kid youve got to do the right thing for him you cant mess with your head its not like a sprained ankle

4636554 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4636555 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4636556 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4636570 maar met ntgent zetten we onze coproducties voort ook al zeiden veel mensen me dat ik gek was om me nog te verbinden aan een huis dat het op dit moment financieel zo moeilijk heeft de artistieke meerwaarde staat centraal zelfs als johan een chinees in plaats van een nederlander was zou ik nog met hem samenwerken een mooi idee voor de toekomst zou ook het eerste echte vlaams nederlandse gezelschap zijn want bij acteurs speelt die vijandigheid tegenover de andere nationaliteit helemaal niet integendeel hun honger naar elkaar is enorm in verschillende artistieke teams vloeit het nu al in elkaar over er zijn een paar moeilijke punten zoals waar dat gezelschap dan zijn huis zou moeten hebben maar het zou een dijkbreuk zijn
4636571 die hetze tegen mensen van buiten is een nare vlaamse eigenschap in nederland speelt dat totaal niet hoeveel vlamingen worden daar niet gastvrij ontvangen
4636572 ik vind het totaal absurd dat er in amsterdam en in vlaanderen twee aparte festivals moesten komen
4636573 we denken dat we het zelf het best weten die breuk verkleint het internationale belang van dit festival voor buitenlanders is de situatie nu totaal onduidelijk het was net door het gecombineerde festival dat wij in de jaren negentig in het buitenland werden opgepikt
4636574 en zo zijn er wel meer mogelijkheden die niet langer uitgebuit worden terwijl beide landen zoveel van elkaar zouden kunnen leren niet alleen de dialoog maar vooral het gemeenschappelijke belang is zoek
4636575 het theaterfestival uit vlaanderen en tf 1 uit nederland werken intensiever samen dan ooit doordat er nu twee verschillende festivals zijn voor het nederlandstalige theater moeten beide festivals niet meer op zoek naar de gelijkenissen maar naar de verschillen een gesprek over de verschillen van de festivals leid namelijk tot een beter besef van de overeenkomsten het theaterfestival aanhalen als de belichaming van het vlaams nederlandse theaterlandschap dat is perfect

4636589 this is probably one of the prettiest rivers weve ever worked on and i can tell theres not too much pollution as far as what were used to do its good to get up here and really makes a difference
4636590 im disappointed that the number came in as high as it did but again i want to emphasize we havent paid it were not going pay that amount and were going to get it down to something that is closer to what we have budgeted

4636600 things were getting a little too efficient around here and steps had to be taken
4636601 im mad as hell and im not gonna take it anymore
4636602 apparently it was big enough that people felt it in michigan it woke them up did you feel it
4636603 mom there are men on the roof that is sooo wrong men on the roof alert make them stop and get on the ground humans are supposed to be on the ground this is so very wrong and its highly suspicious
4636604 the sovereign right of the scottish people to determine the form of government best suited to their needs
4636605 i think the single biggest key to britains constitutional crisis is the fact that the british state has never been founded on any conception of popular sovereignty but on the basis of parliamentary sovereignty conceived originally as the vehicle of a landed elite against absolute monarchy on the one hand and the unpropertied masses on the other
4636606 scotland on the other hand has a long history of at least rhetorical appeals to the idea of popular sovereignty it has never given up that tradition hence nationalism is a natural vehicle for the idea of popular sovereignty in scotland
4636607 part of what is happening now is that latent conflict is coming to the surface
4636608 scottish popular sovereignty cannot undermine british popular sovereignty because such a thing has never existed
4636609 the key issue is how to establish popular sovereignty in the rest of the uk most particularly in england frustrating the popular will in scotland will not help achieve that
4636610 the said kingdoms of great britain and ireland shall upon the first day of january which shall be in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and one and for ever after be united into one kingdom by the name of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland
4636611 do you agree with the constitutional settlement for england scotland wales and northern ireland passed by parliament in the scottish independence act 2011 an independent scottish state and the continuation of the uk as the united kingdom of england wales and northern ireland or the united kingdom of southern britain and northern ireland in my nightmare scenario discussed above

4636646 california curriculum commission recommends six ground breaking reading programs from pearson for states students
4636647 panel recommends six ground breaking reading programs from pearson to californias students
4636648 the instructional materials advisory panel imap of the california department of education has recommended to the curriculum commission a suite of six comprehensive kindergarten through middle school programs that the nations leading education publisher pearson has customized for california to address a range of critical reading issues confronting the states schools
4636649 california has identified a new course of action and we have responded by bringing all our expertise and resources to bear we have taken the challenge seriously by developing exceptional research based programs tailored specifically for california and the unique needs of our k 12 students and teachers
4636650 we are the only publisher with such a unified and seamless approach to the learning and instruction of reading in california pearsons offerings are actually stronger than the sum of our parts because all the programs easily and naturally connect with one another
4636651 they have been critical in establishing pearsons reputation as the leader in reading and indeed set us apart from our competitors
4636652 we must all work together to improve student performance this is critical to the futures of the children in our state and our entire pearson team is 100 committed to californias teachers parents and students to make that happen

4636660 she could go up there and give a flowery speech and then ask her supporters to vote for obama i dont know why she would want a roll call vote and then go down in flames
4636661 i birdied the first three as soon as i did that my mind kind of set in and played nice all day made a lot of putts hit it close
4636662 i just had a brief moment thinking about it but then i was kind of laughing at myself

4636664 overall it was good finished the round off good with birdies on 16 and 17 and made a nice four on the last
4636665 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog

4636670 there is nothing more fundamental than the protection of our nations security and sovereignty
4636671 the cf have a significant role to play in supporting government departments that deal with security issues in the north exercising our sovereignty and providing assistance to our citizens
4636672 multi agency exercises like op nanook which involves the navy army air force and nunavut territorial and federal government departments are important because they provide an opportunity to enhance our capacity to operate together effectively in the case of an emergency or security operation

4636678 theres a very special lady in the audience tonight whos celebrating a birthday
4636679 i was diagnosed with add twice i didnt believe the first doctor who told me and i had a whole theory that add was just something they invented to make you pay for medicine
4636680 but then the second doctor told me i had it i was in denial i dont understand exactly what it is the symptoms seem to apply to everyone around me in the industry loss of memory starting something and not finishing it
4636681 we decided we didnt want publicity we wanted to get married just between ourselves and our children and the judge who is an old friend of the family
4636682 i realised that i hear about these secret celebrity marriages the day after they happen and i dont think anybody is really trying to have a truly secret marriage but most of the fans and most of the media dont even know that im married
4636683 it can be a total secret theres no reason why the helicopters have to show up we were originally gonna do it on a public beach some place until we found out you have to register to do that and get a permit so immediately theyd call up the media and the paparazzi would be showing up
4636684 thats why we ended up doing it in michaels private backyard he lives at the beach and we were barefoot in the water it was a gorgeous day
4636685 it was one of those nights when i wore a supertight dress that you couldnt have worn anything under since it would have showed
4636686 the paparazzi were literally lowering their cameras like speculums when i got out of the car
4636687 on the way home i said to my husband len wiseman darling i think they might have gotten it and so when we pulled in at home i made him re enact the thing with his camera a sort of crime scene run through
4636688 i lose more balls than anyone on the course because i wont go in the rough to get them there are snakes everywhere and they give me the willies
4636689 madonna is at the end of a 30 year cycle in her life a true maturing is happening now its a time when the body starts to show age ageing is never easy for a leo
4636690 going forward she may grow into playing the role of grand dame of the music industry over the next two years well see another face another reinvention of herself that we have not yet witnessed in the past
4636691 she does best in the city of los angeles but in london she shines in a regal way new york is a more stressful city in that saturn is stronger there causing her to feel pressured to work harder
4636692 she should be careful of her health during this two year period as neptune transiting her house of health can possibly bring a health crisis
4636693 madonna should be focusing on altruistic activities otherwise it can create a lot of negative publicity this is not a good time for her to be seeking any accolade for its own sake
4636694 its far better for her to perform acts of altruism that are for communities and the benefit of the world rather than spend time on projects which will get her noticed just for publicity if she seeks no rewards and does work for the goodness of the masses she will reap great benefits
4636695 an eclipse on her sun does indicate a big year ahead for her possibly major shifts in her relationship with her husband and the role he plays in her life she may be relating to the world and seeking a deeper metaphysical life experience more than she is relating to her partner
4636696 eclipses come in cycles the last time madonna experienced this particular eclipse cycle was when she met and became involved with her current husband guy ritchie the cycle before that one was when she and her first husband sean penn got divorced so her marriage may experience some challenges now
4636697 as saturn moves over her moon later this autumn 08 there are usually some changes in the home this could be a move an additional home adopting another child or perhaps one of her children such as her daughter lourdes may decide to study in another city
4636698 we were building up a pyramid the girls had to run up jump on the trampoline vault and then flip onto the top of the pyramid
4636699 when madonna did her little flip and got up there it turned out she had nude tights on and it looked like she wasnt wearing anything under her skirt i was shocked at first and the basketball coach was really upset
4636700 she used to come into our office before class wed put on the music and make her dance and entertain us as well as everyone else in the locker room
4636701 madonna was a determined grade a student i dont want to say she was a nerdy kid but she was more along that sort of line than a trouble maker
4636702 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting divorced in the first place
4636703 the russian tea room has played host to many famous faces throughout its 81 years we salute madonna on her 50th birthday and hope our former coat checker will come back and let us hang up her coat this time
4636704 madonna is not just an extraordinary woman to us she used to be part of the russian tea room family
4636705 madonna has truly made an impact on the russian tea rooms long history with her success it would be a great honour and pleasure to create something special for her after all she is family
4636706 its your birthday so lets be kind shall we and after all theres much worse actresses out there than madonna
4636707 this is such a fun film id even go so far as to say madonna was great in this
4636708 madonna isnt trying to stretch herself here shes merely playing herself a sassy chick from brooklyn whos all about boys and bonking
4636709 madonna is actually quite good in the film though its a flick that requires a bit of patience
4636710 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4636711 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4636712 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4636713 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4636714 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4636715 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4636716 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4636717 for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect
4636718 there is evidence that consumers are becoming more and more interested in growing their own vegetables a national survey conducted last month indicated that many consumers were dissatisfied with the quality of fresh vegetables available in supermarkets and locally the gardening magazine great gardens has sold out at the village news stand three months in a row thus we at green thumb gardening center can increase our profits by greatly expanding the variety of vegetable seeds we stock for gardeners this coming spring
4636719 have built up a self financing war economy centered on mineral exploitation
4636720 growing tendency for states mafia groups offshore banks and transnational mining companies to enrich themselves from crisis
4636721 your president kabila is a crook and this country is going to suffer a lot in a very short time you congolese must know that this country and all its minerals are not yours but ours
4636722 ethnic differences had nothing to do with the war until politicized groups seeking to gain access to the countries wealth came in

4636725 amid chaos in pakistan a disastrous war against western forces in afghanistan fierce fighting in gaza near civil war in lebanon and the hell disaster of iraq
4636726 gaza embodies the entire saga of the israeli palestinian conflict it represents the central contradiction of the state of israel democracy for some dispossession for others it is our exposed nerve
4636727 zero stocks of paediatric drugs including antibiotics and vitamin a and d supplements and a shortage of chronic disease drugs
4636728 remain at the forefront of and initiate efforts to preserve water sources
4636729 in practice these measures have enforced the status of certain west bank roads as almost exclusively for israeli settler use thereby creating a sterile traffic flow for israelis accessing settlements the impact on palestinian life has been profound
4636730 the measures resulted in a movement of underground education when faculty met students in private homes and other unofficial campuses
4636731 this geography shows the real colour of the degradation to which people are subjected and the effects of long standing colonizing policies one would have thought a simple self evident right to education should be guaranteed
4636732 the single biggest impediment to realizing a viable palestinian state with territorial continuity

4636853 i opened the box and found a diamond ring inside
4636854 her son works two jobs and was going to propose that very day
4636855 he suddenly brought out the ring from behind his back and i just started bawling

4636857 i know my wife would be sick if she lost her ring

4636861 the extent of dods contracting is particularly evident during prolonged large scale operations like those in iraq where there may not be enough military personnel available to provide logistics support
4636862 providing security for all personnel including contractors is an inescapable aspect of u s operations in iraq because of the instability and violence in that country
4636863 is at least 2 5 times higher than any other major u s conflict

4636891 it was amazing we were all in fits of giggles because we were so relieved and it was just so funny seeing her legs move to geris singing the next day she opened her eyes for the first time
4636892 i only found out geri was coming half an hour beforehand you just dont expect to be sitting in the hospital and for geri halliwell to walk in she gave me a big hug and said that jessicas story had really touched her

4636895 when the majority of people in the united states want the war to end why arent we talking about bringing our troops home from the middle east
4636896 this is an extremely bad choice for virtually all service members unless they believe they will not live long after they retire
4636897 there must be a better way for people to get money other than to assume this reduction in retirement
4636898 the amount you would have to earn to break even is astronomical
4636899 there is no way you can pay this loan back early and get it off your back
4636900 youre essentially paying it back until you die so if you live to be 100 youre going to pay it back until youre 100
4636901 to pay back 12 times the amount of money they borrowed
4636902 an englishman a welshman and an irishman walk into a canteen

4636905 but when you shall see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not then let them that be in judaea flee to the high mountains
4636906 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
4636907 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
4636908 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
4636909 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
4636910 mr hoyt as a young man saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the buchenwald concentration camp and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget
4636911 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
4636912 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
4636913 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
4636914 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
4636915 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
4636916 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
4636917 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
4636918 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
4636919 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4636920 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4636921 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
4636922 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4636923 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
4636924 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
4636925 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
4636926 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw
4636927 this is going to be the sexiest and most erotic birthday bash ive ever had

4636936 the courses on the pga tour have been set up hard so its a nice change to be really aggressive and sedgefield kind of suits my style
4636937 i try to play really aggressive all the time and so far its paid off great
4636938 as soon as i did that my mind kind of set in and played nice all day
4636939 every time i made a birdie it seemed like he made one too
4636940 this course you can make a lot of birdies but its quite easy to have a few bogeys in there too
4636941 i kind of knew at the beginning of the week i thought it was going to be a low scoring week just because you have a lot of wedges 8 irons 9 irons into par 4s
4636942 under the old system somebody has to come out come to the water meter like this take the top off look inside and take a reading once its automated itll get rid of the need for people to run around and do that work
4636943 were looking at an opportunity where we can read meters more than once every two months
4636944 how do you put a dollar amount on mrs jones who has a leak and being able to tell her youve got a leak today instead of youve got a leak two months from now
4636945 they could drive by and check them instead of walking the street
4636946 it takes them three times longer to walk it instead of doing an automation
4636947 i think it would be easier for the city and less getting in and out of the car it would use less gas i think
4636948 we are short of three players we may have to sell another one to raise the money to buy but if another one goes thats another loan i need
4636949 there is no money left to spend the owner has backed me and i cant fault him there are still great players here but we still are short of cover
4636950 if we sign a few more players we will be a better and stronger team then we will have no choice but to try to finish higher and i feel we can do that
4636951 we were fantastic defensively it is not a bad achievement to keep a clean sheet against them united
4636952 ferdinand and vidic made it difficult for crouchie and me but i think we will all be that much better for the game and ready to face chelsea
4636953 didier will not play in our first game and will probably miss the second against wigan
4636954 when you have a knee injury you just never know hes getting better and is working with a fitness coach back at the training ground i hope he will be ready to start training next week but he will not play until he is in good condition
4636955 anelka has looked good in training and will play as centre forward
4636956 he played well in the friendly matches but he is quiet if you say good morning to him he will say good morning back but if
4636957 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for him
4636958 he cant wait to go to old trafford and play for united
4636959 he feels he behaved professionally throughout this period he has never spoken publicly on the situation out of respect for tottenham
4636960 our hiring manager was super aggressive in recruiting me calling my mom telling her hed look after me make sure i dont fall in the ocean or get lost in a cult all the things that east coasters imagine of the west coast
4636961 theres a handful of guys at intel who have been associated with most of the key product programs and gelsinger is definitely in that crowd
4636962 a very successful culture if i could call it that a combination of paranoia from groves environment and pride in our accomplishment literally that the things we do change the world paranoia in that if we dont do it faster than the guy next to us our lunch is going to get eaten
4636963 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
4636964 youd think that with young players like anderson ronaldo wayne rooney nani there will be improvement there
4636965 i think thats the most natural thing you can say about this club these players have the capacity to improve so well see
4636966 wayne is fit and the good thing he has done very well this week and has been progressing really well
4636967 we had quite a few opportunities last week that has to be said
4636968 we would have liked to have taken them and put the game to bed and if you dont take these chances in games that are close you can regret it
4636969 fortunately last week we were in control of the situation when it went to penalty kicks but we never looked as though we were going to lose it
4636970 but we have a good variety of midfield players and the back four are fit so we have a good foundation if we keep creating chances then we will start taking them
4636971 itd probably be good to have a couple around for spares
4636972 the bottom line is that youre getting rid of the stuff
4636973 most cities are strange in the sense that periodically we have very unique things to get rid of
4636974 luckily the internet is making it easier for us to find these things a home
4636975 we didnt know what to do they weighed about 5 tons they were just huge
4636976 there were rumors for a while that michael jackson had expressed interest in them in bringing them down to neverland

4636979 ayah dan ayah angkatku pernah mengajar ilmu silat kepadaku tapi mereka bukan guruku
4636980 kau mengatakan jika aku bisa menerima tiga pukulanmu kau akan melepaskan mereka aku sudah menerima pukulan pertama masih ada dua

4636988 apa karena melihat bocah itu tampan mukanya kau jadi menuju padanya
4636989 siaowmoay berata begitu karena mengingat keangkeran partai dan guru kita
4636990 ilmu silat partai kita tersohor di kolong langit dan guru kita seorang cian pwee yang berkedudukan sangat tinggi
4636991 maka itu guru kita pasti tidak boleh mempunyai pandangan yangn bersamaan dengan seorang bocah hanyalah karena dia sangat kurang ajar maka guru kita sudah memberi ajaran kepadanya apa soecie menduga soehoe benar benar mau mengambil jiwa bocah itu selama kurang lebih seratus tahun partai kita dikenal sebagai partai dari para ksatria guru kita dikagumi orang berkata kesatriaannya dan kemudian hatinya yang selamanya bersedia untuk memolong sesama manusia bocah itu adalah seperti api lilin sehingga cara bagaimana dia dapat menandingi matahari dan rembulan biarpun dia berlatih seabad lagi dia masih belum tentu bisa menandingi guru kita maka itu apa jahatnya jika kita membiarkan dia mengaso terlebih lama
4636992 sekarang kau boleh menyerang aku mengapa kau tidak mau membalas

4636995 terima kasih atas kasihan cianpwee cianpwee mengampuni juga saudara saudara dari swie kim kie
4636996 tapi karena melihat jiwanya yang luhur yang berbeda dengan manusia manusia palsu dalam rimba persilatan maka aku merasa sayang dan di dalam hatiku lantas saja timbul niatan untuk menjajal tenaga soethay
4636997 kalau kau ingin hidup lebih lama kau masih mempunyai kesempatan
4636998 untuk menyelamatkan jiwa sendiri boanpwee tidak berani melupakan budi orang
4636999 anak ini masih hutang satu pukulan perhitungan harus dibereskan satu persatu sebentar sesudah beres yang satu aku pasti tidak akan mengecewakan tuan
4637000 kalau kau mempunyai nyali binasakanlah anak itu jika dia binasa kamu semua tak seorangpun yang bakal terluputkan mampus tanpa kuburan
4637001 di lain saat tulang tulang dalam tubuhmu berkerotokan seperti kacang di goreng
4637002 biar dia jahat biar dia ganas bagiku cukuplah jika aku sekali menyedot hawa tulen
4637003 orang yang bisa melihat selatan adalah seorang gagah katanya tak malu biat coat menjadi sorang yang berkedudukan tinggi pada jaman ini
4637004 sesudah hari ini menerima budi soethay aku tak berani membuat kedosaan lagi
4637005 ia telah membunuh ibu tirinya menyebabkan meninggalnya ibu kandungnya sendiri dan ia mengatakan bila bertemu ayahnya akan membunuh dirinya
4637006 tak heran ia agak mirip dengan ibu tak dinyana ibuku adalah bibinya sendiri
4637007 hm kau masih memanggil aku thi kukira sesudah mengikuti kim hoa popo kau tak memandang sebelah mata lagi kepada peh bie kauw kau tiada bedanya denagn ibumu hm mempelajari ciaon coe ciat hoe cioe ambillah kaca pandang mukamu yang tak keruan macam apakah di dalam keluarga in ada manusia yang beroman seperti hantu
4637008 jika kau tak menyebutkan kejadian dahulu hari akupun takkan menggusik usiknya tapi sesudah kau menyebutkan itu kini aku ingin menanya ibu telah menikah denganmu dan telah merawat engkau sebagai mana mesti tapi kenapa kau mengambil istri kedua
4637009 orang lelaki manakah yang tak mempunyai beberapa istri dan gundik kau berdosa besar tak guna kau coba membela diri dengan pertanyaan pertanyaan kurang ajar hm kim hoa popo gin hip sian seng sedikit pun kau tak memandang mata kepada peh bie kauw
4637010 dia meracuni ibu tirinya sehingga mati dan diapun menyebabkan matinya ibu kandungnya sendiri perlu apa manusia binatang itu dibiarkan hidup di dalam dunia
4637011 waktu itu in kouwnio masih sangat muda dan sebab jengkel melihat ibunya dihina orang ia sudah melakukan perbuatan yang tak pantas
4637012 dengan mengingat kecintaan antara ayah dan anak aku mengharap cianpwee suka mengampuninya
4637013 bocah siapa sebenarnya kau sehingga kau berani campur campur urusan rumah tanggaku apakah kau seorang boe lim cie coen
4637014 bocah secara mujur hari ini jiwamu ketolongan tapi jika kau tidak mengubah adat jika kau terus coba coba campur urusan orang biarpun kau mempunyai sepuluh jiwa juga tak cukup
4637015 barusan aku menaruh belas kasihan tapi sekali lagi aku tak akan menaruh sungkan
4637016 kau tak usah mempedulikan aku aku takkan melupakan budimu pergilah kau bukan tandingan ayahku
4637017 in cianpwee meskipun ceng ek hong bisa lari sangat cepat lweekang nya belum tentu seberapa tinggi cobalah kita mengejar terus untuk mencoba kekuatannya
4637018 dengan lari secepat ini aku telah menggunakan seantero tenaga dalamku
4637019 in cianpwee janganlah kau memanggil aku dengan istilah saudara panggil saja namaku a goe aku tak punya guru
4637020 kalau dia hidup terus dia bisa jadi bibit penyakit sebaiknya sekarang saja aku mangambil jiwanya
4637021 tak salah lagi ang soei dan liat hwee yang cari lantaran
4637022 mereka rupanya marah sebab aku tidak membantu swie kim kie kalau sekarang aku menyerang dan tidak membinasakan bocah itu dengan satu kali pukul aku mesti bertempur lama sedang aku tak banyak waktunya aah lebih baik aku meminjam tenaga orang biarlah dia mampus dalam tangan wie it siauw
4637023 peh bie kauwsedang menghadapi musuh dan aku harus segera kembali kau saja yang pergi mencari wie it siauw manusia itu sangat lihai dan jahat kalau bertemu kau mesti turun tangan lebih dulu
4637024 benar benar ang soei liat hwee dan houw touw yang menyerang
4637025 kalian semua adalah dari satu golongan mo kauw tapi mengapa kalian saling bunuh
4637026 kalau lehernya digigit dan darahnya dihisap dia tentu lantas mati
4637027 eh sekarang aku yang mau menanya kau perlu apa kau berlari lari seperti orang edan di tengah malam buta
4637028 salah seorang sahabatku telah ditawan oleh ceng ek hok ong dan aku mau coba menolongnya
4637029 ilmu silat ceng ek hok ong banyak lebih tinggi daripada kepandaianmu kau takkan dapat menandinginya
4637030 kalau bukan wanita tak mungkin seorang pemuda rela mengorbankan jiwa untuk menolongnya apa dia cantik
4637031 tak perlu kulihat mukamu apa nona itu mengerti ilmu silat
4637032 cukup pandai dia adalah putrinya in ya ong cianpwee dari peh bie kauw dia pernah berguru pada kim hoa popo dari leng coa to
4637033 tak guna kau mengkejar wie it siauw pasti tak akan melepaskan dia
4637034 antara peh bie eng ong dan ceng ek hok ong siapa yang lebih tinggi ilmu silatnya
4637035 akupun tak tahu antara mereka berdua pengaruh siapakah yang lebih besar
4637036 eng ong adalah kauwcoe dari peh bie kauw kurasa ia lebih berpengaruh
4637037 benar itulah sebabnya mengapa wie it siauw sudah menawan cucu perempuannya in thian ceng ia ingin menggunakan nona itu sebagai semacam barang tanggungan untuk mendesak in thian ceng guna kepentingannya sendiri itulah sebabnya mengapa menurut pendapatku wie it siauw tak akan melepaskan tawanannya
4637038 dia masih begitu muda tapi dia sudah bisa meracuni ibu tirinya dan ibu kandungnya sendiri sampai turut binasa
4637039 di samping itu dia telah mendapat pelajaran dari kim hoa popo aku sungguh menyayang nona yang jempolan itu sekarang kutahu wie it siauw mau mengambilnya sebagai murid
4637040 coe jie sudah berhawa sesat aku tak akan mengijinkan dia berguru kepada wie it siauw
4637041 celaka sungguh kalau dia menjadi siluman yang menghisap darah manusia
4637042 semangatmu cukup baik nyalimu cukup besar hanya sayang dalam sekejap kau akan menjadi mayat yang tidak ada darahnya lagi
4637043 pertama wie it siauw adalah sahabatku dan kedua belum tentu aku bisa menandingi dia
4637044 wie it siauw adalah manusia siluman yang suka menghisap darah manusia
4637045 kalau dia sahabatmu mengapa kau tidak coba membujuknya supaya dia tidak melakukan perbuatan yang terkutuk itu
4637046 dia bukan kepingin menghisap darah secara suka suka dia berbuat itu karena terpaksa kutahu ia sendiri sangat menderita
4637047 belakangan setiap kali menggunakan lweekang ia harus minum darah manusia sebab jika tidak sekujur badannya kedinginan dan jika tidak tertolong ia akan mati beku
4637048 bukankah penyakit itu sudah terjadi karena ketidakberesan pada pembuluh darah sam in
4637049 tiga kali aku mendaki gunung tiang pek san untuk menangkap kodok api guna mengobati penyakitnya
4637050 ketiga tiga kalinya tidak berhasil dalam usaha yang pertama aku bertemu seekor kodok api tapi tidak berhasil menangkapnya dalam usaha yang kedua dan ketiga kodok itu tidak terlihat bayangannya sesudah kesulitan yang serasa dapat diatasi aku ingin pergi ke tiang pek san lagi
4637051 hm lwekangmu sudah boleh juga tapi ilmu ringan badan masih belum cukup
4637052 nanti saja kalau waktunya tiba kita bicara lagi eh perlu apa kau mau membantuku
4637053 kalau berhasil kita bukan saja akan bisa menolong wie it siauw tapi juga bisa membantu lain lain orang yang dihinggapi penyakit yang sama
4637054 cianpwee dia sudah pergi begitu lama dan sudah menggunakan banyak tenaga dalam apakah mungkin sebab terpaksa ia menghisap darah coe jie
4637055 bocah jangan kau banyak lagak dalam karungku ku akan bawa kau ke suatu tempat yang menyenangkan kalau kau bersuara dan diketahui oleh lain orang aku takkan bisa menolong jiwamu lagi
4637056 setelah kau masuk ke dalam karung kian koen tay apa kau rasa bisa lari jika aku benar benar maui jiwamu
4637057 asal kau dengar kata tidak bergerak dan tidak bersuara kau akan mendapat keuntungan
4637058 bahwa kau bisa masuk ke dalam karungku adalah rejekimu yang besar

4637257 the adage you are what you eat has more relevance now than ever before as more americans seek to customize their meals at home in order to evoke their own individual culinary style preferences and taste
4637258 we want our meals our way and when possible we want to do the customizing ourselves
4637259 affordable produce like lettuce and potatoes are essential elements of healthy personalized meals

4637264 the popularity of customizing produce means were seeking out individuality in our meals but were still staying smart and healthy about it thats really encouraging
4637265 whats so great about the customization trend is that it provides at home cooks with literally hundreds of possibilities

4637280 hes provided good care to lots and lots of patients often paying for it out of his own pocket in the cases where hmos refused to reimburse it

4637282 we had built the sets and designed costumes but we couldnt seem to find a sonic screwdriver anywhere as the play is about time travel we really needed the prop which is seen in doctor who shows

4637285 he was the most kind soft spoken man very polite
4637286 he made his bed put his clothes on a hanger he was a career military man spit and polish to the end
4637287 it does concern me that not only in missouri but apparently other states this is the person they turn to
4637288 it does illustrate how difficult it is to find doctors willing to do this
4637289 i assure them ive taken care of everything so that nothing will go wrong i help them calmly go through the procedure
4637290 he is still on leave and we never issued a statement that his services would be terminated his services are still needed by the hospital
4637291 i do not want to comment on that how long he will be on leave or when he is due back

4637298 and will i need to let more hot air in this truck or can i roll up the window and leave
4637299 you have a very poor history of offending a 12 page long history mr gibb said
4637300 the government and vicroads claimed the changes to the laws for new drivers would save 12 lives per year and reduce the number of serious road crashes by 800 a year he said
4637301 going on the present figures the claim is looking flawed
4637302 this to me suggests the law does not work mr boyd said
4637303 learners no longer fail for driving with one hand or for rolling through a stop sign but instead they fail if they cause a motorist to slow down when they try to gradually move lanes he said
4637304 are learners failing because they are making their own mistakes or are they failing because vicroads is making mistakes in its assessment he asked
4637305 its a grey area and if you ask some of the testers how do you clarify this they say they dont know
4637306 they wont tell us the answers because some of them dont know themselves and thats making it hard to teach so thats why a lot of us are teaching the old way
4637307 the system needs a total rethink the government doesnt always get it right
4637308 we went through what had happened and worked out the most likely thing was that she had developed hyponatraemia which is caused by low salt levels in the blood dr murphy said
4637309 we called emergency services but by this stage it was dark and there was no way they could send the helicopter in at night so we had to look after her overnight
4637310 we were told the helicopter would be in at 6am but overnight the clouds came in
4637311 it rained a bit and we got up next morning and couldnt see 10 metres and were thinking
4637312 we had to get the local porters to rig up a stretcher and get her down a cliff face and across a creek
4637313 their skills it was just like something out of the war with the fuzzy wuzzy angels a long day of waiting in the hut ensued with all three doctors aware of the consequences should a helicopter not make its way to the clearing before nightfall
4637314 if we had to stay another night she would have been very lucky to survive dr murphy said
4637315 apparently the medicine woman from the village came out and chanted and cursed at the clouds and spat at them and wailed at them dr murphy said
4637316 then the helicopter flew in and carted the patient off dr murphy and his melbourne colleagues rejoined their group after two days of solid hiking unsure of whether the woman they had watched over a few evenings earlier had survived
4637317 it wasnt until we were on a plane to melbourne and saw a photo of her that we realised she was alive and well
4637318 it was very lucky the chopper got in that night
4637319 we remember those who lost their lives we remember those who came home and we remember those who came home and have since passed away he said

4637325 i dont think it is going too far to say the future of sport broadcasting in central victoria is in jeopardy
4637326 people have to get up and do something or we will lose a vital community asset
4637327 in the next few months we will broadcast five local grand finals but will this be for the last time what infuriates me about this is we are having people two states away making a decision about our community assets and no one asks us
4637328 we will be putting in a submission and we believe we are in a very strong position for a long term licence
4637329 but in the meantime the whole thing is up in the air
4637330 we paid for consultants to find it and prove it was a workable frequency
4637331 i cant see people wanting to listen to parliament or listen to the same news run over and over again all night
4637332 this is a very valuable community asset and we have to make sure it stays that way
4637333 i will be preparing my own submission which argues very strongly that the 89 5 frequency remains a community asset

4637338 his management of the freight looking after the truck mechanically and his work ethics were as good as any employee we have had canny carrying company director rodney canny said
4637339 the combination of the commercial heavy vehicle weighing over 30 tonnes travelling at 60kmh striking the train travelling at 90kmh was devastating sergeant exton said
4637340 in my five and half years in parliament one of the most distressing and heart breaking issues has been the massive shortfall in care for people with a disability or mental illness
4637341 i have had families in my office in tears over this issue
4637342 i have seen individuals and families fall apart under this stress

4637360 i have no use for the palestine liberation organization it is not a political organization it is a criminal organization and a very wealthy one at that any government which recognizes the plo is condoning murder and extortion
4637361 the notion of homeless palestinians is a myth some people who consider themselves palestinians are in fact homeless but a majority are not those arabs who lived in and continue to live in that part of palestine now called jordan are obviously neither homeless nor without a country those arabs who chose to remain in the area that became israel are not homeless and never have been
4637362 solutions can never come from myths they must be based on facts that will not be possible however until people who hate israel stop exploiting the palestinian issue
4637363 the u s governments slavish support of israel brands us as a hypocrite and is responsible for most of the hostility toward the u s americans have been brainwashed into believing that its the arabs and the palestinians in particular who dont want peace that is a big lie israels goal is and always has been to take all of palestine and to get rid of the palestinians
4637364 t heres no group of people in the world who are more clearly victims of ethnic cleansing than the palestinian refugees who have been rotting in refugee camps for 50 years palestinians were ethnically cleansed in 1948 and again in 1967
4637365 the zionists in america are the biggest enemy of freedom of speech and freedom of the press there is
4637366 the israelis are to the palestinians like a 250 pound wrestler assaulting a 4 year old child without pressure from the u s the israeli government will go right on killing palestinians taking their land and expanding israeli settlements
4637367 who would have thought that we would become the rogue nation committing acts of aggression around the globe

4637392 while the smears piled up and the lies were exposed john mccain spent six days in silence and on the seventh day said we should have a sense of humor
4637393 john mccains response to this discredited book speaks volumes he is a george bush candidate running a karl rove campaign with a dick cheney sense of humor
4637394 it was something out of the ordinary and no one knew what it was

4637398 we dont have in our terms of agreement that if you miss a day you get a credit
4637399 we just do that voluntarily because its the right thing to do
4637400 so anytime something like this happens you risk hurting that brand and that can end up hurting you in the long term
4637401 from our point of view its really a non event
4637402 we just decided to get him in a more relaxed environment and work some things out
4637403 we need to get him going were not blaming him but he hasnt been as consistent
4637404 when i go get the ball and look in his eyes i see hes not sure i see hes lost confidence and we dont want him to lose his confidence weve just got to get him going thats through the whole pitching staff
4637405 when you talk about our young kids am i disappointed
4637406 no im not disappointed i feel sorry they have to go out there and go through this but theyre young and theyre inexperienced these guys have upside but we had a need and we pressed them into action theyre experiencing big league life now they have to make an adjustment
4637407 at least theyre taking the ball and going out there i feel for them but we believe these kids are strong and theyll help us in the long run
4637408 with a giant franchise like harry potter in the market we had to stay clear of it

4637412 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4637413 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4637414 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4637415 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4637416 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4637432 i dont want to spend all my life on this event
4637433 i would like to do something else to learn other things
4637434 i condemn strongly this criminal and inhumane act on one of our chaldean nuns in baghdad and demand from the officials to work seriously in tracking down and punishing those criminal thugs
4637435 such scheming would only be sensical in the insanely convoluted musings of a madman
4637436 the 6th anniversary of the murder of sister cecilia moshi hanna
4637437 close encounter with a narcissist parts 1 amp 2 before reading part 3
4637438 the essential feature of narcissistic personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of grandiosity need for admiration and lack of empathy that begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts
4637439 individuals with npd routinely overestimate their abilities and inflate their accomplishments often appearing boastful and pretentious they may blithely assume others attribute the same value to their efforts and may be surprised when the praise they expect and feel they deserve is not forthcoming
4637440 it was so easy thats what made it so much fun
4637441 i know the way joe is so i shouldnt have let it bother me so much
4637442 why do you bother talking about that its in the past
4637443 ill nurse this fallen baby bird back to health using a medicine dropper
4637444 if i can just peel away the layers of hurt i can get to the core of the problem and i can help him heal
4637445 a relatively small but absolutely numerous minority for whom uniform and discipline sacrifice of self and others and blood arms and power were what made masculine life worth living
4637446 pond it is better that the capable worker comes here than that the job goes somewhere else to find the worker
4637447 he no longer caught colds that easily as he had done before
4637448 the boy always looks so hungry since he began physical training
4637449 he rushed to the hospital immediately after getting off the train
4637450 he gently propped up his grandmother tenderly hung the gold medal round her neck and held it so that the medal would not become too heavy for his grandmother
4637451 but it immediately occurred to me that if someone adds the word sheng it would sound as liu jisheng
4637452 i didnt want our son becoming preoccupied with sports he was doing ever so well in school always scoring high in exams and ranking among the top three in his class
4637453 he was too thin and seemed to walk in a strange way
4637454 the boy had excellent flexibility and great speed but he also had the most important attributes required to be a great track athlete a willingness to train hard with competing heart and soul
4637455 i was surprised to learn the boy had been a high jumper
4637456 hurdles is probably the most unpopular among all sports for kids as it has comparative technical difficulty
4637457 my parents led a simple life devoting themselves to me
4637458 i went to the bathhouse with colleagues after work but forgot to tell my husband i would be home a bit late
4637459 he said he felt so desperately worried about me as i wasnt home at the usual hour and that he was thinking about all sort of dangerous things may have happened
4637460 there is no difference between other days and mothers day for me on which to show her my respect and admiration
4637461 there is not enough time for me to set up a close relationship with a girl and it is too early to talk about it now
4637462 she must be kind to my parents she has to be smart but doesnt have to be beautiful but she must be virtuous
4637463 there is not enough time for me to set up a close relationship with a girl and it is too early to talk about it now
4637464 i think we underestimated in certain circumstances what it was going to take to get the system operating due to the complexity of the technology
4637465 fema has certainly held us to a very high standard
4637466 while we are aware that entergy is anxious to have the system go in service we note that their deadline of aug 14 2008 was proposed by them not chosen by the nuclear regulatory commission or fema
4637467 i do think it is important that fema take the time they need to ensure that everything is in order before the new system is brought on line
4637468 i applaud the hard work that entergy fema the nrc and local officials have done to bring us to this point
4637469 tone alert radios are commonly used in nuclear plants across the country so this is not a unique application at indian point
4637470 as an industry and as a company we have a lot of experience with them
4637471 it comes on with that annoying ear piercing emergency tone we just leave it plugged in all the time but they send us a postcard to ask us to check it periodically
4637472 it would have to be in the most centralized room in the house so we could hear it easily the joke of it is that even if it goes off where will we go with these two lane roads around here
4637473 entergy has a commitment that as soon as they get a final approval from fema they will ready to go within eight days
4637474 there have been numerous false starts on this so we have not set up any specific deadline
4637475 it appears the uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools
4637476 confirms that uc may apply the same admissions standards to all students and to all high schools without regard to their religious affiliations
4637477 any instance of gods guidance of history or any alternative to evolution
4637478 instructs that the bible is the unerring source for analysis of historical events
4637479 if scientific conclusions contradict the word of god the conclusions are wrong
4637480 we evaluate the courses to see whether they prepare these kids to come to college at uc
4637481 there was no evidence that these students were in fact denied the ability to come to the university
4637482 if it comes from certain publishers or from a religious perspective uc simply denies them
4637483 peace advocates will likely have the best funded antiwar message in history
4637484 tens of millions of dollars will be raised for voter education and registration and get out the vote campaigns through the 527 committees which disseminate election messages independent of partisan candidates
4637485 i cant tell you how frustrating it is to watch each day go by with opportunities missed just because we lack the resources to do what we know needs to be done

4637487 we need an earned media effort that helps us reframe the war in a cross cutting way that moves a substantial number of americans to take the view that the war is wrong and connect it to a solution namely to safely quickly and completely end the war starting january 21 2009
4637488 we can literally knock on millions of doors on september 20 and get hundreds of thousands of petition signers from all fifty states
4637489 it can be anything from a collaborative experience to shall we say challenging
4637490 i saw it on the other side first which was to get really good directors that you like but you are still the one calling the shots
4637491 he suffered the same way and he had a good relationship with harry cohn so he had some clout but not complete control ultimately no matter how good that relationship is with a showrunner theres going to come a point where youve got to get out of the room
4637492 you have to fall in love with the material in order to care
4637493 then once you fall in love you have to quickly revert to a kind of one night stand relationship with the material i loved her last night but i dont give a shit today thats the attitude that you have to take if youre going to survive the whips and lashes of outrageous fortune in television
4637494 its very important if youre in it for the long run and want the show to stay on for five or six years if you dont stay involved as soon as you leave the show the tone changes it was a mistake early in my career not to do that because if i did i think the tick would still be on
4637495 to help in this sort of graduate school course i had
4637496 it was so complicated 100 speaking parts 200 scenes kind of an epic story squashed down into this one location i needed danny by my side
4637497 in all of the telepic projects that ive worked on none of the writers were producers
4637498 to me it functions the same way as a feature in that youre sent a script and you start working with the writer on that script but they dont get involved in the same way as episodic series
4637499 these defendants set up an offshore manufacturing facility where in unsanitary conditions they reproduced leading pharmaceutical products for importation into the united states all without fda approval or licensing from the rightful patent holders

4637503 heathrow does not compete with gatwick and does not compete with stansted or luton or manchester
4637504 it competes with charles de gaulle in paris dubai now and amsterdams schiphol because these are big international hub airports so the ownership of the airports has nothing to do with competition
4637505 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4637506 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the u k and u s aviation industry
4637507 christmas in august ok its too early to string lights decorate the tree and bake fruitcake but its not too soon to buy holiday air tickets or at least start shopping for them
4637508 we will see some specials for christmas and new years
4637509 its going to be tough out there for people who really need less expensive tickets
4637510 we just are what we are and have been since the 1930s a working family ranch
4637511 people feel disconnected from where their food comes from and they want to be reconnected
4637512 they want to know the farmer and the rancher taking the family and the children to experience gathering eggs being in a barn seeing how cows are milked is also very important
4637513 most people have no idea this kind of lifestyle still exists in marin
4637514 if theyre interested we take them on a tour of our vegetable garden i tell them about our production and where i sell my produce they can find out about cattle ranching and see the cattle up close
4637515 people often get a good education theyre amazed at how much work is involved in farming
4637516 im finding that these days people are also really interested in how we steward the land
4637517 they look at what were doing and we talk about it such as fencing off and planting native plants creek restoration repairing gullies we have a lot of wildlife out here and weve increased the number and type of native birds through these sustainable practices
4637518 our location is unique in that we are a non profit farm within the golden gate national recreation area right on the pacific ocean he says
4637519 theres a natural hospitality that comes from being a farmer thats an ancient tradition
4637520 anyone who has ever worked on a farm realizes that its a lot of work you tend to welcome visitors who want to come and help you or learn in any way
4637521 i have met so many people from other ways of life that as a farmer youd never be able to meet

4637533 i played a mistake free round today which helped me increase my lead
4637534 there were so many putts that were burning the edge of the hole for birdie and lipping out but what are you going to do
4637535 when i can go at pins just like in every other round i will go right at them
4637536 i am not going to change anything but knowing that i am ahead will give me confidence and always be in the back of my head during the last round
4637537 but if i make a few putts and roll in a few birdies early i can put some pressure on her going into the back nine tomorrow
4637538 i am going to play my first nine holes tomorrow like i have been all week which is making sure i get my ball in the fairway off the tee
4637539 if someone else is making birdies and making a good run i will change my mindset and go to match play
4637540 this is a tough field this year and it would be a big confidence booster to win this week

4637589 as pioneer works hard to engage the 12 volt community in raising awareness to the consuming public one outreach about which we feel strongly is charity pioneer is of course directly involved in a number of philanthropic programs however a way to build on that foundation is to recognize the good works of our dealers and the impact they are having on a local level
4637590 drive in autosound has supported our troops in a number of ways
4637591 including accommodation rates and financing for the local military community co hosting football parties with radio station kilo 94 3 fm at the community event center on fort carson military base and active participation in the military connection which welcomes soldiers home from deployment
4637592 so were proud to support the service men women and their families at fort carson making sure that the children of military families have a good holiday is particularly dear to our hearts
4637593 in 2007 we collected more than 5 000 in toys during the local toys for tots drive throughout our five store locations we are grateful to pioneer for helping us provide more holiday joy this year through its community give back award
4637594 the hope and purpose of santas workshop is to make it possible for all soldiers assigned to fort carson to provide for their children during the holidays as one of the elves who assists our soldiers as they come through the workshop i can tell you how deeply our soldiers appreciate the generosity and support that colorado springs and its surrounding communities so selflessly give to this cause
4637595 this year we are expecting 2 000 children in need
4637596 and i was worried about the number of families who need our help you cant imagine exactly how much it means that drive in autosound chose our charity the smiles and squeals of delight from happy children will surely be music to many a soldiers ears this holiday season
4637597 google consistently offers services that makes searching for information fast and easy

4637600 in this partnership with pioneer we are making it possible for users to tap into the power of goog 411 giving a fast means to find and connect with businesses when on the go
4637601 the game changing performance our kuro displays brought to the market last year revitalized the landscape of high end home theater in a way that was never thought possible the introduction of this years kuro televisions is another step toward our ultimate goal of pure absolute black that will fulfill the true potential and all the promise of high definition entertainment
4637602 our goal is to listen and fully understand the minds of creative professionals and their craft when great entertainment comes together something truly magical happens the boundaries of technology fall away and youre left with a truly unique experience this is the hidden key to the power that kuro possesses and ensures the integrity of the artists vision is never compromised

4637606 i could go on and on about no child left behind and what my concerns are with it
4637607 basically in a nutshell is that its bad legislation for kids
4637608 if you disregard those yearly benchmarks and just look at how weve grown each year thats what we look at

4637610 ive only raced her three or four times in the past but each time i remember how she went out faster
4637611 i kind of got it into my head her race strategy it gave me more experience to race against her knowing where she was going to pick it up and where i needed to be
4637612 i have to send that surgeon a thank you note
4637613 it took six or eight months for her to come back from that and obviously shes better than ever now
4637614 i would always have her wear a heart rate monitor just to keep an eye on the problem her heart rate would get well up over 240 when she had incidents and the problem when she had an incident was that she would be exhausted for two or three days after that wed have to get her out have her take deep breaths and calm her down shed then continue to train at a very low level so the operation was absolutely the breakthrough moment for her and since shes been doing a steady climb
4637615 that was one of the highlights of the meet for me
4637616 to know youve won and won by that much over such a rival and great world record holder is a pretty special moment
4637617 i just ran the first 50m then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4637618 to come to the olympic games and make the semi final is fantastic i can only hope that i surprise a few people in the final
4637619 i belong in the final im very confident of making the final ive been in america for too long to let them worry me
4637620 everyone doubted me and ive had injuries but ive proved people wrong
4637621 when people doubt me and put pressure on me thats when im at my best
4637622 i knew i had to run well because i had the hardest heat of all im distraught
4637623 its been pretty frustrating for me its been a difficult season my hamstring has gone twice ive had injuries and yet i made it here and for this to happen is really disappointing and difficult to take
4637624 i got screwed up by a lane draw which i thought was very unfair
4637625 i will have to bounce back for the relay what else can i do im a professional and i will lift myself and come back for that
4637626 his country will sign a cease fire accord with georgia and scrupulously respect all agreements including a troop withdrawal
4637627 all russian troops and irregulars that entered georgia with them must leave immediately
4637628 with the people of georgia and their democratically elected government
4637629 peace needs to re established in the region and guaranteed and underpinned so that no one again will get idiotic ideas and this i see as the main task of the russian federation
4637630 very limited to a light patrolling ability such as a few kilometers outside of south ossetia not the right to maintain a presence inside georgia

4637633 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4637634 its a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation the american side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the united states and russia
4637635 very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia
4637636 the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4637637 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4637638 we agreed this negotiating phase a week ago which was before the events in georgia and because of the us calendar there was some urgency
4637639 but what is crucial and what decided the success of the talks over the last couple of days was that the us offered us new proposals
4637640 as we have the utmost respect for paul newmans acting legacy we hope these rumours are false
4637641 having achieved an install base of over 350 000 consoles to date the ps3 has already found its place in many australian homes
4637642 with more compelling content being made available to ps3 owners every week through the playstation network the extra storage offered in this new model will prove invaluable
4637643 in addition the 80gb memory allows you consolidate all of your digital music photos and movies in one central place within the home and experience them on a high definition tv add to this the ability to enjoy blu ray movies and games and its clear why the ps3 has earned its place as the leading entertainment hub in todays home

4637666 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles a year
4637667 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4637668 they dont have a choice to believe us we have a body
4637669 i dont see how consumer spending turns around anytime before the second half of 2009
4637670 where are the new sources of funds coming from for the consumer clearly the earnings reports show that we are living in a discretionary versus nondiscretionary world
4637671 parents should get on board and let children express themselves
4637672 but at the same time you want them to look put together and not be embarrassed im happy to see this looser sensibility right now letting them express themselves is the prevailing parenting wisdom right now and its nice to see it echoed in fashion andrea harmon director of color and concept for the childrens place says that prints and patterns can even help some children especially little ones who dont have a huge vocabulary put their emotions into something visual they can choose something vibrant when theyre feeling energetic something darker when theyre tired for example more the merrier
4637673 its like there are no rules and thats what children love and parents would do it too if they could
4637674 you have tartan plaid and a bold rugby i didnt always think of them together but now i think its a great combination
4637675 the clothes are coordinated from a color perspective and thats a really important distinction
4637676 theyre not 100 percent matchy matchy that would be interesting enough for children but theyre coordinated
4637677 if you have a large scale stripe you probably dont want to see it paired with something the same scale its just too busy
4637678 the mixing of patterns has been going on in adult fashion for a long time
4637679 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4637680 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4637681 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4637682 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4637683 absolutely clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier the deployment has the russian federation as its target
4637684 it is sad news for all who live on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
4637685 poland is an independent country and its an ally of the united states and its a democratic country to whose security the united states is committed
4637686 russia should welcome having democracies on its border not threaten them
4637687 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4637688 i thought denver would be my last stop but things happened and here i am
4637689 the thing thats always impressed me the most is the way they play the game
4637690 he is a guy i have admired for a long time his playing style and his production he has been a great player with different organizations and with nine pro bowls
4637691 whatever moves they plan on making itll be whats best for the team
4637692 hes just a hard tenacious hitter hes a big guy and he brings it every time he makes a tackle so hes a tempo setter
4637693 i hate to lose him you hate to lose anybody
4637694 but when youve done it for as long as weve all done it it happens every year so somebody else has just got to step in and take his place

4637704 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull

4637713 noel gallagher was very clearly briefed in advance and monitored during the live interview
4637714 as ever noel was a lively and opinionated guest of course radio one does not condone drug abuse and if we felt our guest was drunk we would not put him on air
4637715 weve got some guys bruised up this was a great mental day and we got some work done practice was really good really crisp jason cook is giving us great leadership on the offensive side of the ball and peria jerry on the other side
4637716 hes full speed x rays were totally negative it was just a big bad bruise on the forearm
4637717 um no i dont think i have anything to prove to them rodgers told reporters in green bay on thursday
4637718 id like to throw a couple touchdowns for sure but i just want to play well
4637719 now is that because quarterbacks coach tom clements developed him to that point which i think is a big part of it
4637720 hes a lot more athletic than i realized coming out
4637721 i still think alex has a lot of football in front of him
4637722 but i still do have friends in that organization on the coaching staff and i do hope for those guys to have success

4637725 it is a huge opportunity to have the type of coverage we have in el paso for womens soccer
4637726 we are very thankful for all of the publicity that the newspapers radio stations and television stations provide us with

4637731 the gate of heaven is very low only the humble can enter it
4637732 we shall never learn to know ourselves except by endeavoring to know god for beholding his greatness we realize our own littleness his purity shows us our foulness and by meditating upon his humility we find how very far we are from being humble
4637733 humility is the foundation of all the other virtues hence in the soul in which this virtue does not exist there cannot be any other virtue except in mere appearance
4637734 humility is one of the most difficult virtues both to attain and to ascertain it lies close upon the heart itself and its tests are exceedingly delicate and subtle its counterfeits abound
4637735 humility does not consist in ignorance of truth if a man is above the average height of men he cannot help knowing it
4637736 real excellence and humility are not incompatible one with the other on the contrary they are twin sisters
4637737 jesus invited us to be like him humble of heart but what is humility of the heart it consists in receiving humiliations from god with a submissive love in accepting ones state of life and ones duties whatever they are and in not being ashamed of ones condition
4637738 pride makes us forgetful of our eternal interests it causes us to neglect totally the care of our soul
4637739 true humility does not make a show of herself or use many humble words for she desires not only to conceal all other virtues but most of all to conceal herself

4637752 i think with van persie afellay van der vaart and sneijder we have many creative and explosive players but clarence is on the radar if i get in trouble with the players i selected in terms of form or suspensions and injuries i know i can call on clarence ive seen him play many times in the last years as analyst for sport 1 and i highly enjoyed his performances but i respect him too much to select him now and then bench him i know how to reach clarence when i need him
4637753 we have a score to settle and any first match for any new team manager is a biggie but im not too happy with the planning most players are still in the warm up while the russians are in the middle of their competition but our first real game is in september against macedonia so we need to get ready

4637756 i wanted to give out a message with this group i selected only 19 players a small fixed team i want to create more consistency like this its tough for any club trainer to gel a team together let alone as team manager i wont select players who play one or two great games i need to see more i want to create a core of players who belong in oranje and i will only experiment when forced to
4637757 at the ec2008 weve seen how most goals came from turn around situations if a team has the right positioning its very hard to create something our team has demonstrated it can play sensational football but still our best man was edwin van der sar that tells you a lot we need to focus on our defensive organisation when we lose possession

4637760 if your camera is simple to use youll love to take pictures
4637761 resolution was once widely held to be directly proportional to the number of photo diodes on a ccd we now know that the relationship is not so simple there are many other factors that determine the image quality including a cameras optic system and image processing our answer is the super ccd designed to improve total quality of images the octagonal shaped photo diodes of the super ccd give a larger pixel size than conventional ccds while the interwoven arrangement allows them to be more densely packed thus it is able to increase both horizontal and vertical resolution by using unique signal processing that performs 12 bit a d conversion our super ccd offers high resolution along with other attributes that are just as crucial to image quality including high sensitivity high s n a wide dynamic range linear color gradation accurate color reproduction and high speed responsiveness by balancing all of these factors that have an impact on image quality we have created a camera that offers super high resolution far exceeding all that have come before

4637817 there are some artists who might be more perceptively stable in what their image or sound is springsteen has an identifiable sound and look hes not going to come out suddenly with a mohawk hes a different kind of artist madonna is a pop artist who has always been into different kinds of sounds shes a voracious collector of art shes a fan of music and film not just mainstream fare whats shes doing is not super cutting edge shes usually hearing something she likes and taking ideas and putting them out there
4637818 she wasnt just a sex symbol she was sexually provocative

4637822 i dont think shes necessarily concerned about making a statement shes interested in getting her point of view across and saying something important about the world and how her life relates to the world but that doesnt mean she cant glam it up
4637823 these bases have only recently been upgraded to nato standard

4637827 there are a few countries that will say told you so

4637830 the war in georgia has put the european order in question
4637831 we shouldnt make any moral judgments on this war stopping the war thats what were interested in
4637832 my view is that the russians and i would say principally prime minister putin is interested in reasserting russias not only russias great power or superpower status but in reasserting russias traditional spheres of influence
4637833 my guess is that everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead
4637834 an invasion of ukraine by peacekeeping tanks is just a question of time
4637835 weimar russia is completing its transformation into something else if russia wins this war a new order will take shape in europe which will have no place for ukraine as a sovereign state
4637836 there is a lack of a clear and unified european policy towards russia
4637837 the russian strategy of keeping control of exports and supply is outpacing any european response
4637838 in politics it is very important to know ones measure
4637839 if russia continues to inflict strikes on georgian territory on facilities on population centres we may lose the moral supremacy we have today
4637840 this may not be a culmination but only step one

4637920 yet many patients who experience the debilitating effects of this injury enjoy some sort of sport or physical activity and so getting them back on the court or the field or the track or the gym or wherever they enjoy being active is a key objective
4637921 the standard non operative treatment which works in 95 of patients for tennis elbow is the rice approach rest ice compression and elevation
4637922 non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and corticosteroid injections are often prescribed as well
4637923 its also clear that these approaches provide largely temporary relief which means the patient would desire a repeat injection and or continue with the pain relievers indefinitely
4637924 we are now able to surgically repair or release the injured tendons using the two portals three millimeters each which means a much quicker surgical recovery than would be necessary with an open procedure
4637925 this is also a longer term solution to the problem of tennis elbow and patients are able to regain range of motion and resume normal activities be it work or sports more quickly
4637926 this sounds obvious but many tennis elbow patients are guilty nonetheless
4637927 because the procedure is relatively new very few surgeons are experienced in the technique

4637931 he is a master of the blade quite possibly the worlds best
4637932 they say he has none and that he travels alone accepting no students and only stopping to challenge those he feels may exceed him in skill
4637933 bravado of that sort will get him killed soon but what happens if he wins
4637934 he has not yet lost because he has not yet come here
4637935 keep them focused on the movements of your opponent learn to study them quickly for you may not get another chance
4637936 but what if i come across la espada what do i do about him
4637937 that man is only a myth raphael a ghost story for swordsmen with too much bravado remain ever humble and you will always defeat him
4637938 though he doesnt want to admit it the thought of having to fight against such a man troubles him
4637939 a long time ago long before i knew him your papa once fought a duel with someone he once called brother he had to kill that man he doesnt want to kill another
4637940 but if la espada comes he will have to fight
4637941 you are still a boy rafa and you will not get involved in the business of men leave that to your papa
4637942 a man will come for you a warrior of great skill but you will not meet him your time for battle has passed
4637943 i am not a coward do a rosalinda i fight in my own battles
4637944 it isnt your choice freder co your time as a warrior has passed it is the will of fate the man of the east comes for you but another will go in your place
4637945 i cannot see some things are only for fate to know
4637946 i have traveled extensively from my home and through this lovely country fighting those deemed the best and conquering them each
4637947 now i have come to fight freder co clemente renowned in all of spain as the greatest master of the blade and instead i find a boy surrounded by his nurses
4637948 you will treat them with respect while you are in my home
4637949 where is your father child i will not leave until i have gotten what i came for
4637950 he cannot face you if you have any sense of mercy you will understand that and leave
4637951 se ora if i had any sense of mercy i would not be here however i am a man of reason and fairness if he is too ill then give me a room i will wait until he is well
4637952 then what options do i have left either he fights or i wait
4637953 i would sooner fight you myself than let you stay a night in my home
4637954 se ora were you of my sex i would only be too delighted but flowers have no place in battle
4637955 and i expected you older perhaps wiser from how the travelers speak of you
4637956 am i to believe that you are what they say a golden child with royal blood but no royal title well it matters not truly i have dealt with princes before
4637957 then you will find no trouble in dealing with me sir
4637958 you would stoop so low as to engage in battle with a child
4637959 and yet he involves himself in the affairs of men if that is what he truly wishes then so be it i will treat him as a man though not as my equal surely you cannot expect that of me
4637960 you are making a foolish mistake child but it is not my place to excuse that but very well i will return at sunset and then we shall see whether you live up to the reverence you get
4637961 do you know which one you are going to use
4637962 do not lose sight of your goal raphael never lose sight of your goal which is to come out the victor your opponent will try many things he will test your defense and trick you into an offensive trap but that is the point of combat it is about keeping the other man on the line between thought and instinct so that he never knows what to expect next keeping the opponent guessing and making mistakes so that when they make the largest one you can attain victory with flawless grace
4637963 i have to concede gypsy child that you know your way around a blade
4637964 whoever thought it smart to teach a boy to fight like a man
4637965 well perhaps he taught you how to die like one as well
4637966 all this fuss and yet one of us has yet to make a true hit
4637967 you are a young boy you should still hold an interest for them but here
4637968 i wager that i can strike first blood on you before you can do so in three strikes
4637969 if you manage to get first blood on me you may kill me
4637970 your sword and your word that you will put aside the warriors life
4637971 so many warriors renowned famous and notorious and here i am undone by a simple child
4637972 i am a man of my word as you have proven to be
4637973 remember my face raphael clemente you shall never see another like it
4637974 the city pulled its voting machines from here because the building gets too hot yet now theyll put people in there who use those machines to vote
4637975 there are no toilets there theres no water no fire suppression the city should be ashamed it needs to stop criminalizing protests
4637976 we asked them if a detention center existed they told us it will be business as usual dont worry about it
4637977 apparently the training received by the undercover officers in charge of crowd control didnt sink in theyre the guys who arrested john heaney and broke his two front teeth smashing his head into the asphalt
4637978 were asking that those officers be off duty during the convention
4637979 leon was terrific hes been terrific the last couple of weeks
4637980 hes just starting to get over his ankle injury he was what we needed today that sort of finishing off power around the ground
4637981 i was particularly pleased with chris dawes and travis travis was fantastic
4637982 given weve lost rusling rocca reid and dick and weve elected not to play didak theres four that would generally be part of our forward line so weve had to reinvent the forward line
4637983 jack anthony who wed trained up as a key back came in and hes kicked goals every game hes played
4637984 and chris dawes for his second game he actually gives travis a little bit of leeway
4637985 the thing today about chris dawes was hes highly competitive didnt go to ground and was also another target so he helps
4637986 under the circumstances with a couple of blokes who couldnt go back on the ground and given weve still got a very very young side if theres a w next to your name at round 20 you take it
4637987 he was outstanding theres no question about that any player that has seven centre clearances by half time is giving you some trouble
4637988 its one of the best performances ive seen until half time
4637989 ive no idea its round 20 it may not be anywhere near enough it may well be enough the ladder is so insignificant its round 22 you look at it and go thats where we finished
4637990 avevo qualcosa che volevo proteggere e quando la persi compresi quanto fossi impotente e che ognuno di noi troppo impegnato a difendere s stesso per pensare agli altri cos mi dissi
4637991 this is not a done deal we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future

4637996 you have shattered all sort of records with truly inspiring olympic character
4637997 when i look at michael and i think of the lore of what he has done over the last four years its more remarkable than myself
4637998 in ceding my record for most olympic gold medals i do it with little regret
4637999 we share the joy of competition and a timeless joy for excellence
4638000 i did mine last century michael is taking off this new century hes a great leader for the olympic movement i know him personally i think hes a great kid and i wish him congratulations
4638001 i dont really believe that exists everybody brought something to the table
4638002 i say wow we have somebody else whos amazing lets just tune in thats where i am
4638003 ive always marveled at the fact that in the last four years
4638004 he has had to live with a lot more expectations and anxiety that i had to deal with
4638005 i was under the radar circle only in swimdom circles did people understand what i was trying to do and only after four days of an eight day competition did people from other venues start to understand what was happening at the swim venue in germany
4638006 hey its ok records are made to be broken including mine thirty six years is a long time
4638007 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
4638008 after having done hundreds and hundreds of articles and interviews with people over the last six months it was bound to happen some article taking off in a different direction i dont begrudge that happening this is part of the process of interpretive evaluation
4638009 its my passion its like candy for me i love it
4638010 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4638011 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4638012 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4638013 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4638014 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4638015 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4638016 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4638017 falcon hill has finally gone from a dream to a reality
4638018 the air force sunset ridge the state of utah and the communities surrounding hill air force base have been working together for mutual benefit from this project
4638019 this is a great project that demonstrates what an enhanced use lease can do
4638020 as late as two weeks ago we faced an obstacle that could have dramatically reduced the amount of office space provided to hill however with hills team arguing the merits with the services negotiators of utah and us doing the same with the pentagon in washington we were able to reach a solution agreeable to all parties now this has truly been a joint effort and there are a lot of people who deserve credit
4638021 sunset ridge partners are very honored to be the ones chosen to develop this project
4638022 it will be an important chapter in the joint economic life of hill air force base and the adjacent cities and counties
4638023 this project will provide significant new growth to the area
4638024 the new jobs and businesses that will be attracted to this project will increase the quality of life for all utah the adjacent cities and counties as well as the state should be congratulated on their collective efforts to help the air force and sunset ridge make this project a reality
4638025 these are exciting times for hill sunset ridge and our community many have worked hard and long to arrive at this significant milestone and we are eager to break ground this fall
4638026 the hill project is a tremendous example of what public private partnerships can accomplish for our communities the state and the military this project will promote our vision of the future for northern utah as a growth center for the aerospace industry we are happy to be working with the air force and sunset ridge on this important development
4638027 it provides an opportunity for the air force to capitalize on underutilized assets including real property by leasing the land to private entities and to address air force infrastructure requirements such as construction repair maintenance and improvements of facilities
4638028 one of the unique things about this project is the worldwide and nationwide recruitment effort by the developer the developer is not trying to take existing tenants from nearby communities but is hoping to attract new high tech companies from many diverse areas across the country
4638029 generally the russian forces are starting to move out of the city particularly gori starting to consolidate their positions and get themselves into a position where they can start to back away towards the border
4638030 we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4638031 over the last 24 hours really there has been no air activity
4638032 so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4638033 what we dont want to do is build some sort of mountain of supplies there with no distribution system
4638034 u s transportation command our service components and enterprise partners are capitalizing on our world class global transportation network to support the regional commanders requirements
4638035 we are closely monitoring the situation and stand ready to continue supporting the humanitarian assistance efforts for the people of georgia
4638036 the flexibility of our mobility forces allowed our nation to respond quickly to the republic of georgias request for assistance
4638037 air mobility brings a unique tool to our nation and its partners
4638038 it underwrites our ability to project power and reach and allows us to provide assistance to those in need
4638039 every time i meet with the women of panjshir i leave with two very distinct feelings
4638040 first i appreciate the freedoms i have as an american second it makes me feel very positive about the way women feel empowered to help with their families and communities
4638041 these women all have great ideas about what can be done to make their villages better
4638042 for instance they talk about the need for power drinking water and schools
4638043 the women talk about wanting to learn skills that will help generate money for their families and villages
4638044 women want to work and little by little theyre being able to
4638045 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
4638046 if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4638047 carry on vaccinating until we find out why vaccines are killing cats and which cats are most likely to die
4638048 examples are the encephalitides following measles chickenpox rubella smallpox vaccination vaccinia and many other less well defined viral infections
4638049 our ongoing studies of dogs show that following routine vaccination there is a significant rise in the level of antibodies dogs produce against their own tissues some of these antibodies have been shown to target the thyroid gland connective tissue such as that found in the valves of the heart red blood cells dna etc i do believe that the heart conditions in cavalier king charles spaniels could be the end result of repeated immunisations by vaccines containing tissue culture contaminants that cause a progressive immune response directed at connective tissue in the heart valves the clinical manifestations would be more pronounced in dogs that have a genetic predisposition although the findings should be generally applicable to all dogs regardless of their breed
4638050 many veterinarians trace the present problems with allergic and immunologic diseases to the introduction of mlv vaccines
4638051 routine vaccinations are probably the worst thing that we do for our animals they cause all types of illnesses but not directly to where we would relate them definitely to be caused by the vaccine
4638052 i think that vaccines are leading killers of dogs and cats in america today
4638053 homoeopathic veterinarians and other holistic practitioners have maintained for some time that vaccinations do more harm than they provide benefits
4638054 in response to this vaccine violation there have been increased autoimmune diseases allergies being one component epilepsy neoplasia tumours as well as behavioural problems in small animals
4638055 cancer has been described as the wound that never heals
4638056 all successful cancers are surrounded by inflammation commonly this is thought to be the bodys reaction to try to fight the cancer but this is not the case
4638057 the inflammation is not the body trying to fight the infection it is actually the virus or bacteria deliberately causing inflammation in order to hide from the immune system authors emphasis
4638058 effects of vaccination on the endocrine and immune systems of dogs phase ii

4638063 the first american in history who has ever raised old glory over a part of the japanese empire
4638064 i dont want to give that impression the honor belongs to every man in my platoon three of us actually raised the flag lieutenant harold g schrier our company executive officer sergeant h o hansen of boston and myself but the rest of the men had just as big a part in it as we did
4638065 lieutenant schrier unhesitatingly exposed himself to the onrushing enemy and by his personal example and shouted encouragement rallied his small force and led it to a counter attack which destroyed forth six of the enemy and caused the survivors to withdraw in disorder
4638066 the damned war with spain was the main cause of all frances misfortunes
4638067 spain defeated the most powerful army in the world with inestimable british help
4638068 british historians have tended to treat the conflict as a british war in which spaniards were at best auxiliaries and at worst got in the way
4638069 in fact its a spanish war or rather an iberian war that included portugal in which britain got involved you can understand why spain wants to commemorate it as a spanish war
4638070 forget guernica picasso never saw war goya was there leaning from his balcony anyone whos ever seen war can tell that goya is painting the truth he knew everything about war
4638071 we are bombarded every day by images of war but goya saw it all 200 years ago
4638072 goyas disasters mark the maximum expression an artist has ever achieved of the irrationality of violence and its terrible human consequences
4638073 while in other countries invaded by napoleon resistance was a minor regional problem
4638074 the guerrilla crystallised the desire to resist that predominated in the countryside it was the only form of combat that the weak could adopt against the strong the guerrilleros were relatives and friends of villagers they were accustomed to fight in an organised way
4638075 popular resistance was mobilised throughout the war by punitive taxes demanded by the french army a constant reminder of enemy oppression
4638076 no spaniard in their right mind could have imagined that spain could conquer the imperial giant on their own
4638077 the spaniards with their determined struggle showed that in spite of their weakness and with simple weapons and methods proper to insurrection they obtained great results the heart and spirit of a nation forms an important factor in the national combative strength it is to be hoped that governments will make use of this in future wars
4638078 still less attractive was his tendency to seek scapegoats for his frustrations favouring the noose whips and public punishment he disdained notions of democracy and political progress but all these defects could not conceal the basic fact that he was a military genius his frigid manner reflected a distance that enabled him to be always ahead of the enemy long exasperated by his spanish allies he ended up praising them as the best he could have had
4638079 they were so excited theyre rvers so they can go anywhere on the road find a computer go into the phoenix public library catalogue download a book and play it while they drive down the highway
4638080 those who see god are within god sharing his glory
4638081 for man is spirit the elements are eternal and spirit and element inseparably connected receive a fullness of joy and when separated man cannot receive a fullness of joy
4638082 for the dead who were in the spirit world had looked upon the long absence of their spirits from their bodies as a bondage
4638083 beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is
4638084 who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself
4638085 and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many
4638086 the soul shall be restored to the body and the body to the soul yea and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body yea even a hair of the head shall not be lost but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame
4638087 now concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrection behold it has been made known unto me by an angel that the spirits of all men as soon as they are departed from this mortal body yea the spirits of all me whether they be good or evil are taken home to that god who gave them life and then shall it come to pass that the sprits of those who are righteous are received into a state of happiness which is called paradise a state of rest a state of peace where they shall rest from all their troubles and from all care and sorrow
4638088 and how shall man pass into god if god had not been caused to pass into man
4638089 the logos of god jesus christ our lord was made that which we are in order that he might perfect us to be what he is
4638090 the logos of god was made man in that you might learn from a man how to become a god
4638091 jesus answered them many good works have i shewed you from my father for which of those works do ye stone me the jews answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself god jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said ye are gods
4638092 god standeth in the congregation of the mighty he judgeth among the gods i have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high
4638093 and it shall be said unto them ye shall come forth in the first resurrection and shall inherit thrones kingdoms principalities and powers dominions and all heights and depths then shall they be gods because they have no end therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting because they continue then shall the be above all because all things are subject unto them then shall they be gods because they have all power and the angels are subject to them
4638094 and the lord said unto me these two facts do exist that there are two spirits one being more intelligent than the other there shall be another more intelligent than they i am the lord thy god i am more intelligent than they all
4638095 now the lord had shown un to me abraham the intelligences that were organized before the world was and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones and god saw these souls that they were good and he stood in the midst of them and said these i will make my rulers for he stood among those that were spirits and he saw that they were good and he said unto me abraham thou art one of them thou wast chosen before thou wast born
4638096 and there stood one among them that was like unto god and he said unto those who were with him we will go down for there is space there and we will take of these materials and we will made an earth whereon these may dwell and we will prove them herewith to see if they will do all things whatsoever the lord their god shall command them and they who keep their first estate shall be added upon and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their fist estate and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever
4638097 now the lord had shown unto me abraham the intelligences that were organized before the world was for he stood among those that were spirits and he saw that they were good and he said unto me abraham thou art one of them
4638098 god himself finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory because he was more intelligent saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself the relationship we have with god places us in a situation to advance in knowledge he has power to institute laws to instruct the weaker intelligences that they may be exalted with himself so that they might have one glory upon another and all that knowledge power glory and intelligence which is requisite in order to save them
4638099 man was also in the beginning with god intelligence or the light of truth was not created or made neither indeed can be
4638100 our spirit matter was eternal and co existent with god but it was organized into spirit bodies by our heavenly father
4638101 through that birth process self existing intelligence was organized into individual spirit beings

4638126 but theres more sex in that one paragraph than in all the snogging in harry potter as time magazines lew grossman put it in his recent profile of meyer
4638127 i think of the books as very romantic says the impeccably groomed meyer who takes her new celebrity standing more or less in stride and still feels guilty about being unable to personally answer her stacks of fan mail with the

4638129 the host meyer says she read the text aloud to her eldest son age 12 as she did with the first
4638130 i dont read more than that to him because i dont trust him not to sell me out to some cute 12 year old meyer says
4638131 the host is aimed at adult readers and it is a little darker and grittier
4638132 what compelled me to write it down was that i have a really bad memory meyer says
4638133 it was always a story i was not thinking when i wrote this is a dream i did not think of it as a book the important part of the dream was the conversation
4638134 twilight book the others followed as quickly agreeing with the publisher about a book cover she observed often takes more time than writing the book itself
4638135 the host took a more conventional route but arrived as wholly formed
4638136 i tend to see everything like a movie in my head
4638137 i love the art of hip hop i dont always love the message of hip hop
4638138 there are times where even with the artists i love you know theres a message that is not only sometimes degrading to women not only uses the n word a little too frequently but also something im really concerned about its always talking about material things
4638139 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics

4638154 they hold up a mirror for us thats the power of the theater in film its almost a little voyeuristic like youre once removed in the theater its a spiritual experience it goes beyond words you cant describe it in words it transcends language
4638155 the fact that it is a true story makes it all the more touching all the more engaging
4638156 yes we laugh with and at times at these two fragile survivors locked forever in a relationship as devoted as it is debilitating
4638157 but we love them too we care about their survival in a world that has proven too much for them and which could prove the same for us someday as well
4638158 a singing version of the 1962 cinematic shocker what ever happened to baby jane
4638159 the real deal the endangered breed an old school rodgers and hammerstein style book musical
4638160 right now the musical is only spoken of in terms of her performance the legend of that performance overwhelms the script and score which is among the best of recent years
4638161 as new productions are mounted i think audiences will begin to appreciate the piece on its own merits
4638162 its two strikingly different acts taking us from the swirling heights of high society to the depths of neglect and abandonment leaving us to speculate on the path of that descent over the course of some 32 years
4638163 the truth of the edies lives is a study in contradictions their story is uniquely american and i think reflects on how we view artists and outsiders in our society
4638164 we think we are fascinated by eccentrics because they are so quirky but really what draws us to them is that they show us portions of ourselves in a distilled fashion they remind us of who we are
4638165 she never lets you dismiss her the minute you think she is crazy she says something which is absolutely and terrifyingly true its what makes the maysles documentary so enduring this distillation of truth
4638166 little edie is such a compassionate figure shes very vulnerable and yet very strong shes almost like an angel thats what the musical does for people its such a cathartic experience by the end of the show people would be sobbing its almost spiritual its a transformative experience
4638167 their presence is absolutely gigantic because of who they were in their lives their bravery and courage what they were up against and the staunchness of their characters they really serve as inspiration to people in their own lives being who they are and not being ashamed of that
4638168 we are so pressured to conform to conform to conform but then who are you they knew who they were and they were not ashamed they were not sorry they were proud
4638169 sebelum ini mereka kagum rakyat malaysia baik tetapi yang saya hendak sangat mereka mesti akui kepandaian kita dan kemahiran tinggi yang dimiliki pengiktirafan inilah yang kita mahu capai seperti orang jepun diakui kebolehannya dalam bidang teknologi tinggi
4638170 mengapa tidak bagi rakyat malaysia kita boleh malah semangat malaysia boleh mesti ada pada diri kita yang mahu sentiasa maju kita perlu tingkatkan nilai kecemerlangan kita
4638171 bagaimana nanti mereka hendak bersaing dalam dunia pekerjaan yang memerlukan kemahiran yang tinggi kerana itu mereka yang diambil menjalani latihan kemahiran kini ialah pelajar lepasan spm sijil pelajaran malaysia dan stpm sijil tinggi persekolahan malaysia
4638172 dengan sukatan pelajaran yang berubah kita membuat satu anjakan yang penting dengan memberi tekanan kepada kemahiran lebih tinggi kerana industri di negara kita semakin meningkat berbanding dulu
4638173 sekarang kita sudah mampu menghasilkan produk yang lebih berkualiti dengan adanya peralatan komputer dan mesin canggih yang dikendalikan tenaga kerja berkemahiran
4638174 kalau suasana bekerja sentiasa ceria ini akan menjadikan mereka yang bekerja di situ berasa seronok
4638175 a search and rescue helicopter team has now returned the six missing australian climbers found in the metelille glacier area back to the mt cook village base the rescue coordination centre rcc new zealand said in a statement
4638176 all have been checked by medical staff and are well with no injuries
4638177 he wants to write his own tunes instead of ruining everyone elses gallagher said
4638178 mark ronson needs to learn three chords on the guitar and write a tune
4638179 i did drugs for 18 years and i never got that bad as to say you know what i think the kaiser chiefs are brilliant
4638180 anybody whose drummer writes the songs are not to be trusted
4638181 stale urine and suggested live aid supremo bob geldofs daughter peaches should be stamped on
4638182 god almighty i have respect for sir bob stamp on her though
4638183 noel gallagher was very clearly briefed in advance and monitored during the live interview
4638184 as ever noel was a lively and opinionated guest of course radio one does not condone drug abuse and if we felt our guest was drunk we would not put him on air
4638185 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4638186 this is a planning took where all things are going
4638187 the family of tim johnson would like to express our deepest sympathy to mr gwatneys family our hearts are heavy with grief for your loss we ask the media for time and privacy as we seek to deal with this tragedy which is beyond our understanding
4638188 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4638189 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4638190 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4638191 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4638192 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4638193 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4638194 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4638195 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4638196 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4638197 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4638198 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4638199 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4638200 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4638201 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4638202 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4638203 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4638204 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4638205 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4638206 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4638207 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4638208 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4638209 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4638210 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4638211 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4638212 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4638213 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4638214 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4638215 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4638216 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4638217 numerous times three times in illinois voted for legislation that would allow doctors and patients to murder babies who survived abortions and were out of the womb radical stuff three times he voted for this
4638218 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4638219 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4638220 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4638221 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4638222 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4638223 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4638224 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4638225 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4638226 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4638227 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4638228 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4638229 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4638230 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4638231 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4638232 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4638233 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4638234 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4638235 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4638236 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4638237 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4638238 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4638239 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4638240 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4638241 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4638242 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4638243 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4638244 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4638245 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4638246 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4638247 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4638248 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4638249 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4638250 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4638251 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4638252 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4638253 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4638254 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4638255 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4638256 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4638257 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4638258 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4638259 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4638260 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4638261 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4638262 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4638263 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4638264 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4638265 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4638266 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4638267 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4638268 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4638269 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4638270 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4638271 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4638272 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4638273 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4638274 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4638275 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4638276 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4638277 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4638278 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4638279 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4638280 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4638281 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4638282 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4638283 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4638284 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4638285 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4638286 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4638287 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4638288 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4638289 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4638290 a lot of these established guys want to play around in this space where theres no constraints for time and all sorts of great stuff they can do
4638291 some of this will incubate online and possible transition into series stuff and some of this is literally meant to be short form entertainment

4638299 squatting monkeys tell no lies shot in santa rosa and shaped in a mill valley theater the special is out on dvd on tuesday he notes in a phone interview from beverly hills he appears at wente vineyard in livermore on wednesday and at the mountain winery in saratoga on thursday
4638300 once the kids came i kind of semi retired carvey says

4638302 squatting monkeys tell no lies straddles the manic and reflective
4638303 i think when dana was working on his special he kind of fell in love with stand up again says cobbs comedy club booker tom sawyer who regularly hired carvey at the club in the 80s

4638306 when you change the culture you have to change peoples behaviors and when you change behaviors you change their habits
4638307 the government has refused to release the plan or subject it to committee scrutiny and media reports indicate that it will be implemented this fall
4638308 we therefore have no choice but to force the committee to meet as quickly as possible they have had eight months to level with canadians since the plan was reportedly approved yet they have refused what are they hiding

4638324 whos the boss shows my age who survived to star in
4638325 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4638326 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4638327 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4638328 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4638329 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4638330 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4638331 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4638332 i guess cashmans great farm system isnt so well stocked a we were lead to believed
4638333 get rid of him i dont care that hes 23 years old we need more over priced free agents that will collect their money and not try
4638334 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4638335 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4638336 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4638337 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4638338 she wrote to him every day from her hotel room and kept his responses in a silk lined tufted pink jewelry box already stuffed with expensive hatpins from tiffany a small hand painted compact full of fashionable faux beauty marks and theatrical baubles bought on lower broadway
4638339 a woman is most beautiful when she is most herself and least aware of it
4638340 the patch as it first came it was one of the most harmless and effective aids to beauty ever invented t was but a tiny mole like black spot of black velvet or silk which was used to draw attention to some particular feature as well as to enhance by contrast the fairness of the cheek thus if a girl was conscious of a pretty dimple on her chin or of long eyebrows or if her forehead formed the best part of her face or her mouth she cunningly placed the little patch near it and consequently every time you looked at her your eye was insensibly drawn by the patch to the best feature so that you partly forgot any less handsome detail to an accustomed eye the patch gives a singular finish to the toilet it is like a the seal on a letter or the frame to a picture you see the grey powdered curls and the bright eyes and the low luxurious bodice and the ribbon necklet around the throat ad if the patch is absent it is instantly missed and the whole toilet seems incomplete this craft little piece of vanity was afterwards vulgarized of course the tiny round spot was transformed into a star or a crescent that increased in size and multiplied in number blind vanity forgot that in trying to draw attention to all her features at once she drew attention to non and later on it ran to such absurd extremes that ships chariots and horses and other devices in black paper began to disfigure the female visage and at last the whole face was bespatted with vulgar shapes having no meaning unless sometimes a political one and of being of no value to beauty whatever
4638341 to be honest i dont even think about last year
4638342 everybody knows about our crash last year but thats not going to happen again
4638343 people asked i was getting questions every day so i just let them know where things stood right now
4638344 theres still a lot of competition going on at every position
4638345 its great having coach harbaugh whos played and competed on every level hes more of a realist when it comes to the offense he knows not everything always goes right the best advice he gives us is to think on our feet and when things dont go according to plan have composure
4638346 i would show you everything but everything is too extreme
4638347 always know sometimes its me but you know i know when its a dream i think a
4638348 oh thats okay were not going to release until next year
4638349 my parents richard and margot never spoke about it in front of me and my sister evelyn
4638350 for their generation the atrocities that happened in the second world war were still too raw all of her life my mother couldnt bear to watch the sound of music because of the nazi persecution in the film
4638351 until you personalise the holocaust it really is hard to comprehend six million jewish people were exterminated but how can you get your head around that number its only when you focus on the fate of one family that you can start to understand the horror
4638352 the genealogist petje schroeder shows me a record card with weider besiedelt on it the german word for resettled
4638353 then she gently breaks the news that it was a euphemism for ausgerottet exterminated to see this official card with such ruthless information on it was just chilling it was just a job to the nazis like stacking shelves in a supermarket
4638354 theres significant damage there it will take several months to repair
4638355 my understanding is that there is nothing they can do to lock that gate in place
4638356 were going to have to get at least commander level approval
4638357 were not going to want to adjust them on a frequent basis
4638358 beyond that we may have a difficult time drawing the reservoir down as fast as wed like
4638359 pinks are found in the columbia during odd numbered years some of the largest numbers possibly a few hundred fish are found in the lower cowlitz
4638360 theyre kind of an oddball they do exist to some degree
4638361 however it is very unusual to find pinks in the columbia during even numbered years
4638362 occasionally we get pinks they dont belong in the columbia
4638363 this settlement starts the federal agencies down the path of honestly addressing a serious problem endangered salmon still face in our rivers too many pesticides and other chemicals it also brings more certainty to the agricultural community by ensuring that these issues will not be hanging over them indefinitely cleaning up our rivers is good for both fishermen and farmers and will also help restore thousands of lost fishing jobs to the northwest
4638364 the issuance of water rights would be based on the success of the program
4638365 weve identified some conservation projects that we think will work pretty well
4638366 it goes back to the idea of awarding the efficient
4638367 nowhere is water more essential to the environmental and economic welfare of a region than here
4638368 these projects will help protect an agriculture economy that generates 3 1 billion every year for the region they will provide water thats absolutely essential for growth and development these projects also ensure that we will have more water in the river for our endangered salmon during the driest months this is a triple win for eastern washington families businesses and the environment
4638369 bringing water to red mountain will open up one of the states prime viticultural areas and exponentially contribute to the states already successful wine industry
4638370 in addition the exchange of yakima river for columbia river irrigation water will materially increase in stream flows in the lower yakima benefiting endangered salmon and steelhead runs in the river
4638371 the commission is at the point now where it can make a decision
4638372 but we have always reviewed them taken them into consideration
4638373 the estuary is an important place for steelhead and salmon
4638374 its a very complex project with a lot of moving parts
4638375 my staff has been working on this project for three years
4638376 the fercs conclusion that the project would have limited adverse impacts appears unsubstantiated without greater detail and description of the mitigation recommendation which are needed to fully assess the environmental impacts
4638377 fercs report represents a failure to be accountable to the people of oregon
4638378 the disregard for oregons concerns is unacceptable particularly on a project with such profound potential impacts on the lives of oregonians
4638379 ecology is disappointed that fercs final environmental review for bradwood landing failed to adequately address concerns we raised in previous comments on behalf of washingtons citizens and environment
4638380 we are asking ferc to require northern star to obtain and comply with state and local environmental permits as a condition of any approval order or certificate
4638381 the overall level of detail in the feis is inadequate much of the feis contains only general information about environmental and resource effects there is little or no linkage between the factual information supporting the feis and the conclusions in the document nor has ferc staff proposed enforceable conditions to the ferc license to address most state agency concerns
4638382 ecology is disappointed that fercs final environmental review for bradwood landing failed to adequately address concerns we raised in previous comments on behalf of washingtons citizens and environment
4638383 we are asking ferc to require northern star to obtain and comply with state and local environmental permits as a condition of any approval order or certificate
4638384 if the project is authorized we will work closely with our counterparts in oregon who have the environmental regulatory authority over the terminal construction and operation to keep washington residents concerns in the forefront
4638385 any state or local permits issued with respect to the jurisdictional facilities authorized herein must be consistent with the conditions of this certificate
4638386 however this does not mean that state and local agencies through application of state or local laws may prohibit or unreasonably delay the construction or operation of facilities approved by this commission
4638387 have been upheld when they are in conflict with states
4638388 the ecology of this bradwood site compared to that of other lng proposed sites leaves no doubt less harmful alternatives are available
4638389 bradwood is a unique valuable and productive salmonid rearing habitat that must be preserved and protected not destroyed
4638390 in total stark contrast the bradwood lng project would be a large scale industrial development that will have lasting permanent negative affects on the surrounding fish habitat and related environments
4638391 this initiative is aimed at addressing 21st century water challenges and ensuring secure water supplies for the future
4638392 we encourage our stakeholders and the public to review the plan and provide any comments they may have
4638393 senate passage of this compact will help us protect the great lakes from water diversions and preserve this invaluable resource for future generations
4638394 by passing and enacting the great lakes compact and keeping control of the lakes in the hands of the states that surround them and value them the most
4638395 will protect the health of these precious bodies of fresh water preventing unnecessary and dangerous diversions of great lakes waters i know the people of wisconsin feel strongly about the importance of preserving the lakes for future generations
4638396 would preserve and protect one of our national treasures for us and future generations
4638397 its time to seal the deal and protect our lakes our drinking water our economy and our way of life
4638398 congress entrusted nmfs with determining when impacts reach the level of significant
4638399 the plaintiffs object to the exercise of this lethal take authority on principle
4638400 they believe that it should never be used except as a last resort
4638401 but that argument has been rejected by congress which has weighed the protection of sea lions under the mmpa against the protection of threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead under the esa and found that the protection of sea lions must yield under these circumstances
4638402 while plaintiffs undoubtedly disagree with this policy the fact is that nmfs complied with applicable procedures used its expertise and reasonably concluded that all of the relevant statutory factors were met this decision was further supported by virtually every other expert that reviewed the issue
4638403 individually identifiable pinnipeds which are having a significant negative impact on the decline or recovery of salmonid fishery stocks
4638404 measurable growing and could continue to increase if not addressed
4638405 mortality rate for listed salmonids caused by sea lion predation is comparable to mortality rates from other sources that have led to corrective action under the esa
4638406 applying these factors the record amply supports nmfss conclusion that sea lion predation is having a
4638407 based on the bioenergetic needs of the species actual take may be as high as 12 6 percent of listed spring chinook and 22 1 percent of listed steelhead
4638408 this level of impact is sufficiently large enough to have a measurable effect on adult salmonid productivity
4638409 comparable to impacts nmfs has sought to decrease under the esa for example nmfs has reduced the harvest allowed for tribal and commercial fisheries nmfs has also recommended a series of steps to reduce the impact of the columbia river power system by incremental improvements
4638410 plaintiffs repeatedly argue that the impacts of predation are at most 4 2 percent this is incorrect
4638411 in addition plaintiffs argue that other decisions made by nmfs under nepa and the esa make this decision unreasonable this argument fails because nepa and the esa are different statutory schemes with different standards definitions and purposes and also because the specific circumstances underlying those decisions make simple comparisons inapt
4638412 reached a conclusion that flies in the face of more than a decade of past administrative decisions concerning the relative significance of those other reasons for the decline of salmonids
4638413 however nmfs was not required to eliminate or minimize the impacts of other actions before finding that impacts of california sea lion predation are significant under section 120 of the mmpa and accordingly plaintiffs argument lacks merit
4638414 the threat to the salmon and steelhead in the columbia river is current and it is significant the loss of salmonids to csls at bonneville dam is new and growing the exercise of this authority poses no threat to the csl population
4638415 wdfw agrees with and joins in the motions filed by the national marine fisheries service nmfs and the oregon department of fish and wildlife odfw and the arguments in support of those motions
4638416 recovery planning and other efforts to reduce impacts to salmon in the columbia basin have been guided by the principle that all manageable sources of salmon mortality should be addressed this approach is based on recognition that the decline in salmonid populations has many causes and there is no single action that will restore these fish
4638417 california sea lion predation is currently the only measurable potentially manageable and yet increasing source of salmon mortality in the columbia basin

4638424 many ossetians i met both in tskhinvali and in the main refugee camp in russia are furious about what has happened to their city
4638425 they are very clear who they blame georgias president mikhail saakashvili who sent troops to re take control of this breakaway region
4638426 witness accounts and the timing of the damage would point to georgian fire accounting for much of the damage described in tskhinvali
4638427 this is something that had it been about south ossetia could have been resolved within certain limits
4638428 russian peacekeepers were in the area that is true and russia initially said it needed to act to protect its peacekeepers and its people
4638429 but what russia has done is well beyond anything that anyone could say is for the protection of those people and for those peacekeepers

4638478 hal tersebut akan dapat membantu usaha saya untuk mempersatukan umat buddha di dunia yang saya rintis sejak saya terjun dalam buddha dharma dengan adanya titik titik ketidaksamaan yang begitu banyak antara ajaran agama buddha aliran utara dengan ajaran aliran selatan pekerjaan untuk mempersatukan pendapat mereka sungguh saya rasakan kesulitannya
4638479 namun melihat dasar fundamental yang sama antara aliran utara dan selatan maka saya masih mempunyai harapan untuk dapat mempersatukan pendapat mereka dalam merencanakan sebuah bendera persatuan yang dapat diterima oleh semua pihak

4638523 the wind rushes out of the valleys and as it hits the ridge the higher the ridge the more speed it gains as it goes up
4638524 by reducing the ridge altitude by hundreds of feet you change the wind patterns and therefore impact the wind speed
4638525 taking the wind map in gis software i placed the turbines along every part of the ridge at class 4 or higher wind speeds
4638526 using a spacing of three rotor diameters between turbines i found that 220 turbines could fit along the ridges
4638527 a lot of developers are wary of west virginia because most of the places where they propose wind arent in the coal fields theyre in the non coal producing counties where theres a lot of people with summer or winter homes or ski resorts and theres a lot of opposition

4638703 in addition to his commitment to reform the convention funding process sen

4638724 in this article the authors argue that the overwhelming portion of the literature on intelligence race and genetics is based on folk taxonomies rather than scientific analysis they suggest that because theorists of intelligence disagree as to what it is any consideration of its relationships to other constructs must be tentative at best they further argue that race is a social construction with no scientific definition thus studies of the relationship between race and other constructs may serve social ends but cannot serve scientific ends no gene has yet been conclusively linked to intelligence so attempts to provide a compelling genetic link of race to intelligence are not feasible at this time the authors also show that heritability a behaviorgenetic concept is inadequate in regard to providing such a link
4638725 sternberg in press found that analytical tests of the kind traditionally used to measure so called general abilities tend rather strongly to favor americans of european and asian origin but tests of creative and practical thinking show quite different patterns we also know that there is a substantial genetic influence contributing to individual differences in levels of academic achievement luo thompson amp detterman 2003 yet we do not know a single gene that has been identified as contributing to either academic achievement or iq thus the statement that racial differences in iq or academic achievement are of genetic origin is when all is said and done a leap of imagination the literature on intelligence race and genetics constitutes in large part leaps of imagination to justify post hoc social stratifications there is nothing wrong in principle with people expressing their views on social policy but they need to recognize these views for what they are social policy pronouncements not science

4638788 the generally accepted rule is pink for the boy and blue for the girl the reason is that pink being a more decided and stronger color is more suitable for the boy while blue which is more delicate and dainty is pertier for the girl

4638791 neither roman nor maciej giertych nor orzechowski responded to natures request for comment
4638792 however the point that really requires further discussion is not evolution but how a minister can say such stupid things
4638793 im not a creationist my views are based on science here is my evidence in the form of creationist boilerplate im not a creationist
4638794 the bible does not list the names of every creature on the ark it does say that one set of every kind of air breathing animal was on board genesis 6 19 20 7 15 16 so dinosaurs must have been included
4638795 these claims are stupid only made by ignorant people who dont take the time to read
4638796 the monster hunter franchise is going to be increasingly important for western markets we have long term ambition to grow the brand to be as large across the west as it is in japan
4638797 capcom wont comment on monster hunter 3 in north america
4638798 mad world sic has yet to be classified and so no one should have seen it fortunately there is enough information about it in the public domain to enable judgments to be formed this is sufficient for anyone to express concern about the self proclaimed and stylised brutality the game contains it will be up to the bbfc to grant or refuse a classification and whether or not they listen to our concerns or give in to the demands of the industry
4638799 john beyer there is enough public domain info on madworld to form judgments
4638800 all of our characters theres no one in particular that were trying to show the public like this is who this person is this is how this person is
4638801 what we want to show the idea of the whole show is just to show the public that this can happen to anybody and if it does happen to you these are also the consequences that come along with it at the same time these are the perks in other words were showing the life of an artista has been or new sikat or not how is the life of show business behind the camera and not only in front where all we see really is the glitz and glamour of show business but what we dont see is whats really going on
4638802 you have to do certain things in it so many factors involved into becoming a superstar so to speak
4638803 were definitely going to show some dirt in terms of what goes on like kunyari artistas getting involved with producers like in my characters case a director i end up with an artista
4638804 you dont have to be an artista to fall in love with another artista i mean you know you can be an artista and fall in love with a director for example and because you just do and not because for any other reason
4638805 so we will show these little sides that people really dont see or normally speculate about so were going to try and and clear up a lot of speculation and also were going to try and clear up a lot of truths i guess and show a little bit of dirt parang ganon
4638806 basta theres going to be a lot of diferrent issues within different characters and these are issues that people really deal with behind the camera so i would say so far and by far it is the closest thing to reality that ive read and im doing at the moment
4638807 oh were friends not close friends but friends in fact i just talked to her this morning because were already planning our sons first birthday party were finalizing it already thats gonna be at the 27 th of this month
4638808 definitely im not going to tell him no im going to encourage him to go into show business in fact i was already offered to do a commercial with him supposedly and i said lets do it im still waiting for the client
4638809 they said hey your son is so guwapo maybe you guys want to do something together and i said i would love to just let me know and tell me i will do it so hopefully soon
4638810 when we test earlier for aids we can organize a better future

4638817 every great project needs to transform itself in order to excel and today we are starting that process
4638818 embassy does not condone incidents of this nature and assures that it take the necessary measures to ensure that such incidents are prevented in the future
4638819 everything is back to normal were much better and security is i mean we made sure that embassy is not only the most fun place to party in manila but its also the safest
4638820 hindi totoo yon lumalabas nga na personnel from embassy actually he was the emcee for the night hindi siya deejay mali yong napabalita sa diyaryo na employee na deejay namin wala kaming deejay na nambugbog he was the emcee for that night
4638821 kasama yan sa posisyon kasama sa lugar kasama sa napili naming industriya na were susceptible to intrigues and accusations and all that kasama talaga
4638822 ngayon we encourage people to go out and party earlier para they can go home earlier you know by two thirty three o clock theyre at home already so perfect they can go home earlier and be productive the next day
4638823 so far so good were working to make it better as as we always want to do
4638824 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4638825 but with little leverage in the face of an emboldened moscow washington and its friends have been forced to face the uncomfortable reality that their options are limited to mainly symbolic measures such as boycotting russian hosted meetings and events that may have little or no long term impact on russias behaviour the officials said
4638826 e dumalaw lang kasi rin siya dito ipinakilala ko siya sa mga department heads pero ako teka muna ang dami ko pang dapat gawin dito sa batangas im not entertaining it
4638827 sweet naman niya thank you naman kay bong pero ah he can plan his political career he can plan it if he really wants to run then go ahead wala naman siyang dapat i worry sa akin
4638828 thank you bong thank you naman pero you do your thing you dont have to worry about me i appreciate it pero wala because ang concentration ko ngayon talaga focused sa batangas wala ka namang magagawa ng dalawang taon lang e alam mo ang ibig kong sabihin three years ang term mo as a governor pero on the third yan naman hindi ka na napapakinabangan dahil nag uumpisa na ulit ng kampanyahan yan
4638829 so far so good awa naman ng panginoon maganda yung koleksyon buo yung maganda ang aming local revenues collection solid ang programa ko wala pa akong isang taon nalibot ko na ang buong batangas lahat ng 34 na bayan
4638830 ah so far im getting the full cooperation of my sangguniang panglalawigan yan ang pinaka mahirap kasi e pag hindi mo kasama ang iyong sangguniang panglalawigan mahihirapan ka being the executive kasi lahat yan dadaan sa sanggunian mo e
4638831 ah i think diyan medyo nahihirapan si ano si father eddie panlilio am i right
4638832 but im very thankful even yung mga mayor na hindi ko naging kasama noon theyre been very very supportive
4638833 wala namang pagkakataon na walang bumatikos sa akin maski nung mayor pa ako dito pinagbibintangan ako ng jueteng jueteng god knows first month ko pa lang dito sa lahat ng buong bayan nagpalabas na ako ng sulat saying na i am not encouraging any form of gambling including jueteng
4638834 and then may mga lumalabas diyan na may share daw ako may kotse
4638835 but ako lang mapapatunayan ko sa inyo im not encouraging it walang sugal na pupuwede sa akin pero i cannot do this alone ayaw ninyo bantayan ninyo e diyos ko paano ko mababantayan tulungan ninyo ako
4638836 kasi ganito yan wala silang masasabi sa mga programa ko na pinapatupad e humahanap talaga sila ng lahat ng butas na pupuwede nilang ibato sa akin meron bang namintas sa mga programa ko
4638837 but again ang point ko dito kung puro jueteng ang iisipin ko sa buhay ko dito ay wala akong magagawa sa constituents ko hindi lang jueteng ang problema ng lalawigan napakaraming dapat pang gawin hindi ba
4638838 kung yun ang iko concentrate ko dahil tintira ninyo ako diyan e teka muna excuse me hindi lang jueteng ang problemna mas maraming gutom dito at uunahin ko yun at uunahin ko na masiguro na maganda ang kinabukasan sa edukasyon ng mga bata kaya ngayon ibato ninyo nang ibato gawin ninyo
4638839 pinapaliwanag lang sa kanila kasi sinasabi nila si ralph ginawa yun for the country e
4638840 napaka negative na niya tinanong ko nga siya nagsisisi ka ba dahil sa vat issue sabi niya no no regrets kung mangyayari ulit yun sa atin at alam ko yan ang makaka save sa bansa natin ganun pa rin ang desisyon kong gagawin kahit hindi nila ako iboto yun ang sinabi niya i respect that
4638841 kung nagpunta kayo dito nung first six months ko makikita ninyo sa blackboard siya lahat ang gumawa bakit ito ang dapat magkano ang budget dito nasa blackboard para alam ko kung saan ako pupunta without ralph din paano ko gagawin lahat yan
4638842 e unang una hindi naman ako politiko pinag aralan ko yes pero ang expertise hindi ko alam kung saan ko kukunin yun kaya ngayon napakadali naman sa akin dito sa batangas hindi pa dumarating yung krisis natin alam na namin kaya nakaka prepare kami
4638843 ah wala akong ano wala akong political plan pero kung halimbawang tatakbo ako ulit for another term parang gugustuhin ko pa rin na tapusin yung mga programa
4638844 oo i dont mind kahit nine years pa basta ma implement lahat ng programa ko makita nila ang pagbabago ah alam na dito napayagan na ako at ibig kong sabihin walang ibang pinakamaganda kasi kundi yung continuity ng programa e
4638845 ah kasi yung mga programa hindi mo matatapos ng isa dalawang taon ang mangyayari niyan puro umpisa kasi kapag may pumasok na naman na iba papalitan na naman niya lahat yun ang nakakahirap sa ating pilipino kapag may nakita kang magandang programa which i did also in lipa noon ang ganda nung lipa city public college imagine mo kay mayor ruben umali yun hindi ko siya tinanggal ginandahan ko pa yung lipa city public college di ba
4638846 so ngayon ang usapan namin nina malou at least basta nakita ko na ang programa ko ongoing after one year and then smooth na pupuwede ako and nag meeting na ako sa kanila
4638847 meron dito pero meron din sa new york nabasa ko nga yung write up kay john lloyd na touch naman ako nung nabalitang hindi matutuloy
4638848 sabi niya intindihin naman natin si ate vi kasi bagong upo lang siya which is true kasi siyempre akala niya baka tinanggihan ko hindi kasi maganda yung movie maganda talaga yung movie
4638849 meron akong anak na bading pero wala na yung maraming maraming bading isa lang tapos nagkaroon ng relasyon kay john lloyd pero later on mamamatay yung anak ko kaming dalawa ang mag eengkwentro ngayon dahil galit ako sa kanya
4638850 hindi pero in fairness kay shawie hindi lang naman ito ang huli naming usapan nung birthday ni ate cristy fermin
4638851 gusto ko yung ano e gusto ko yung ano pelikulang ano yung mag friendship na nag suicide sa huli
4638852 pero hindi naman kailangang hindi naman natin gagayahin yung ending pero yung tema ng character puwede yun
4638853 kung ako yun ang ideya ko ng movie naming dalawa pero hindi ko alam kay shawie kung ano ang gusto niya but si shawie sabi niya ate vi kahit extra lang ako kahit na ano matuloy lang ang movie natin together alam mo naman si shawie
4638854 wala namang problema doon sana makita kasi hindi ko naman siya nakakausap e alam mo ang ibig kong sabihin pero kung ano yung nalalaman ninyo nakakarating din sa akin hindi ko alam kung confirmed but the way things are going mukhang hindi nga maganda tama ba ako
4638855 when i read the script kasi hindi ako bitin ako sa character nung nanay the character of the mother is 30 percent of the story it doesnt matter as long as may tatak pero doon sa nabasa ko nabibitinan ako tsaka yung pagkamatay niya ganun e bitin
4638856 and in fact i told raya to show you raya how interested i am na makagawa ng isang indie film ilang beses tayong nag meeting ni hindi tayo nag usap about my fee because i want to try it unfortunately lang nung nabasa ko yung script bitin yung character na gusto ko
4638857 wala namang kumakausap sa akin in interview lang ako sa birthday ni ate cristy fermin pero yung sasabihin mo may nagsabi sa akin hindi ko alam na may gagawing miss x e sila lang ang nag inform tapos magge guest ka raw walang lumalapit sa akin tungkol diyan
4638858 tsaka hindi ko nga alam e kung ano ang puwede kong gawin doon wala nga akong ideya e kaya depende walang nakikipag usap sa akin tungkol doon in fairness but if they want to do a remake i dont mind okey lang sa akin yun pero kung may special participation hindi na muna
4638859 hindi ko rin alam kung ano ang gagawin ko diyan e wala akong ideya basta ang alam ko isa siyang ofw na napunta sa amsterdam naging biktima doon walang choice nawalan ng pera hanggang maging girl siya sa red light district ang ending niya in spite of all the hirap bumalik pa rin siya ng pilipinas walang choice kaya wala akong nakikitang puwede kong gawin doon sa remake
4638860 noon pa rin yan oo nga e yung time ko pati yung special meron sila yung pang 40th anniversary ko nagplano na sina chit guerrero buhay pa yung direktor ng
4638861 kasi dapat nag ano kami nung 40th anniversary ko sa show business pero hindi rin nagawa because of the time pero excited na ako miss na miss na miss ko na rin ang showbiz sobra nami miss ko talaga
4638862 alam mo kasi kung minsan happy din ako kapag nire remake ang pellikula ko ibig sabihin ang gaganda nung ginawa ko
4638863 hindi ko pa napanood yung movie ni john lloyd at sarah a very special love pero pinapanood ko lahat ang aming kasambahay oo gusto ko yung trailer cute cute siya ang galing ng trailer
4638864 thats why parents should adjust isipin mo kung ako yung makaluma nagalit na ako noon sa sagot niya pero hindi you should understand them
4638865 natawa rin ako yun para bang o just know your limits yun lang pero pag hindi ka adjusted mahihirapan ka maka cope sa klase ng mga bata ngayon
4638866 later on kung ano kasi nakikita niya rin ang ginagawa ko nakikita ni luis yung pag nakita niya na mahal din ako ng tao parang pupuwede raw siya tinanong ko rin siya e sabi ko anak someday nai imagine mo ang sarili mong ganito sabi niya yes mom
4638867 im very proud of my son he can act pero may room for improvement pa rin kasi tini text ko yan e was it yung kampanerang kuba anak anak sobrang lukot ng mukha mo nung umiiyak ka meron naman anak perfect ang tulo ng iyak ganyan lang pag aralan mo yan you know i tell him that
4638868 ah okay sa anak ko minsan nagtatanong pa siya sa akin so may room for improvement si lucky ah hosting no doubt tsaka kapag napapanood ko ang yabang ko ang galing niya talaga singing career pareho kami o di ba
4638869 dancing career kami the best ang galing galing niyang sumayaw bihira nga siyang sumayaw sa asap 08 e hindi tinanong ko rin anak ano bang ano mo sa asap host daw talaga siya binibigyan lang siya ng ganun dance numbers kapag birthday niya pero ang kontrata niya doon is just a host not really a performer tapos ang isang proud lang ako sa anak ko imagine lucky now is 27 mabait pa rin di ba
4638870 huhulihin ninyo ako e basta alam ko maligaya si lucky ayoko because there are some private moments na hindi dapat sabihin pero si mama pala ang nagkukuwento pero ano very marespeto nakasama ko siya angel sa mano po marespeto siya at saka tahimik lang
4638871 maganda yung impluwensiya ni angel kay luis i agree with edu even yung outlook ng anak ko ngayon iba maganda maganda tsaka laging happy tsaka guwapito kasi nga blooming
4638872 hindi puwede bibigyan ko siya pero hindi ko ipapasa ang panyo ko because ako ang mawawalan ayoko
4638873 marami na rin akong nairegalo sa kanya pero hindi lang namin sinasabi marami na kaming regaluhan sa isat isa pero sa amin na lang
4638874 you know sa nakikita ko ha parang maganda yung team nung dalawa kasi yung weaknesses nung isa nandun yung strength and baliktad and they compliment each other with that and they both grow positively nagtutulungan sila
4638875 kasi yun din ang nababanggit sa akin ni angel kapag nagkakausap kami at yun din ang nababanggit sa akin ni lucky so which means naggro grow sila positively and sa relationship yun ang importante yun ang maganda doon
4638876 may time na sabay sila angel at luis at least ang anak ko natututo marunong nang mag grocery ngayon magluto ay ano ka ba e hrm yan mas marunong siyang magluto kesa sa akin pag gumawa yan nung mga gourmet na prawns hindi nga ako marunong magluto yung anak ko gourmet kung gumawa
4638877 ang dream niya talaga someday to have his own restaurant and bar but i told him then na you have to get also ano business management course in order na ma guide an ka you know
4638878 pinagbibigyan ko once a month na lumabas sa goin bulilit si ryan alam nyo ba nung grade v siya nung finals niya hindi na siya kumuha ng final exam exempted siya nagte test yung iba niyang classmates siya nasa bahay kasi sabi ko its your exam im exempted mama i just go there to visit my classmates and he is the president of his class ngayon siya na ang presidente ng klase niya hes grade six na
4638879 im proud of my two sons ralph recto he husband is doing good im being guided by ralph mahal ka ng constituents mo yun ang nagbibigay sa akin ng adrenalin lakas ng loob kaya pinagtatakhan nila paano ko raw nakakaya lahat yun yun e parang yung kabuuan
4638880 pag uwi ko nandiyang tuturuan ko ng assignment yung anak ko magkasama kaming nanonood ng tv kakain kami kung ano ang gusto namin lalaro magsu swimming kami si lucky nandiyan lagi walang araw basta pagkagaling ko ng opisina paglabas ko nito office ko call na ako anak where are you anong gimik mo do you have work today every day yan twice a day one checking in the morning and one after my work i double check my children
4638881 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4638882 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4638883 for everybody who is participating its a very important job
4638884 most of the time with scientific work you see an end product that is maybe a scientific paper but you dont see an end product like we see now hopefully a new line on the map
4638885 we want to have capabilities to deal with potential threats
4638886 but were certainly not going to arbitrate some sort of solution related to the extended continental shelf using patrol vessels to even set it up like were responding to the russians to me is missing the point the science has to come first
4638887 directives on the use of the name of god in the sacred liturgy
4638888 an opportunity to offer catechesis for the faithful as an encouragement to show reverence for the name of god in daily life emphasizing the power of language as an act of devotion and worship
4638889 and how is your sexual health are you having pain when you have intercourse are you aroused as easily as before
4638890 what a mom would say in a 24 hour period
4638891 you want to go protest at the bigfoot seminar in palo alto
4638892 afterwards i was thinking we could go to crogans in walnut creek and inappropriately grind on some chicks on the dance floor
4638893 sounds good ill put on my coors light hat and come over and pick you up
4638894 i just think it has to bright and sunny for the deep fish to bite
4638895 when the sun is out the fish hold tight to the deep brush piles in practice we had bright sunny days with temperatures in the 90s practice wasnt spectacular but i was confident that i could catch at least 8 pounds a day
4638896 i havent fished shallow all week but im going to try it for a few hours this morning once it gets real hot ill go back deep the deep fish are definitely untapped while the shallow fish are getting hammered
4638897 whats got me scared is that i could see the fish on my graph i just couldnt get them to bite with all those people fishing shallow i think the weights are going to drop tremendously today if they dont ill be shocked
4638898 i expect this tournament to be won shallow probably with a flipping stick in hand
4638899 im around tons of fish between the two of us we caught 18 keepers yesterday and my co angler is leading the tournament if i can catch one 4 or 5 pound fish i should be in good shape
4638900 one of these days i hope to win this tournament it could be this year im just taking it one step at a time
4638901 fordon ofta m ste f ras i betydligt l gre hastighet n skyltad hastighet f r att trafiks kerheten inte skall sidos ttas
4638902 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4638903 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4638904 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail and wanting to make you work even harder
4638905 of course we knew one would win and one would be second
4638906 i think we did prove that we are very strong we had a few little mistakes in two days its tough but 1 2 is not by accident i think we are very strong in gymnastics and there is more to come
4638907 we kind of have been going back and forth the entire year and knew it would come down to the final competition and it came down to our final event
4638908 i am very very proud of both of the girls
4638909 they raised the standard of womens gymnastics even higher today
4638910 both my parents have been a big influence on me
4638911 my dad is with me in the gym every day and he is the reason why i am an olympic champion
4638912 to know that he was so close to that and didnt quite achieve it i hope i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him
4638913 a lot of them talked about being hit and kicked in the abdomen and having direct blows in that time
4638914 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
4638915 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
4638916 theyll come at you sideways its how they think its how they move sidle up to you and smile hit you where youre weak
4638917 a south florida man who claims hes being evicted from his place of business because he speaks no spanish just english says
4638918 ive had second thoughts believe me ive been really nervous all the jokes from friends involve death
4638919 youre going to actually sit on my lap is that ok
4638920 are you going to ask me what i want for christmas
4638921 a murder is senseless when it is unnecessary to allow the defendant to complete his objective
4638922 if you missed wednesdays show then no doubt you havent heard about the miscarriage of justice in a maricopa county court room because most news outlets let this one slip by without comment
4638923 upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
4638924 if there is pressure or stigma if you have mental health problems a drug addiction or live in poverty all of those things are likely to cause serious emotional problems later whether you had an abortion or a regular delivery
4638925 no credible evidence that a single elective abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women
4638926 it is a traumatic thing they do suffer from guilt i have seen many many cases of people who suffer clinical depression
4638927 ive talked to people that have attempted suicide in the past and they do say its because of the pain they have suffered because of abortion
4638928 no evidence sufficient to support the claim that an observed association between abortion history and mental health was caused by the abortion per se as opposed to other factors
4638929 strong and complex feelings before and after a major life decision including the decision to choose an abortion or to carry a pregnancy to term are a natural part of life
4638930 my dream home in the centre of the page and drawing around it a circle a heart whatever takes your fancy

4638932 de seguro no sabe el truco para encender la estufa
4638933 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end that the bubble is going to burst
4638934 the u s was the first economy to hit trouble
4638935 now people are realizing that the problems arent limited to the u s in some places they might even be worse
4638936 the usds upward momentum is developing freight train like qualities shredding those who attempt to fade the move but rewarding those on board
4638937 primarily the notion that the rest of the world is finally following the u s down the tubes
4638938 we have seen the lows of this multiyear cycle but i dont see the dollar going on a long bull run at this point

4639139 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4639140 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4639141 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4639142 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4639143 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music

4639452 eh lihat pak jabir non olga itu cantik sekali ya mana kulit perutnya putih mulus gini bener bener amoy dah
4639453 pak pak jabir lagi ngelamun apa pak melamun non olga ya
4639454 hush mau tau saja sudah cepat kita kembalikan semua nanti non olga marah lagi melihat koper ini terbongkar seperti ini
4639455 kalo bisa besok aku kepingin melihat lihat koleksi foto non olga ah
4639456 yang foto bikini tadi aku memang pernah lihat di sebuah majalah waktu dipanggil pertama sama non olga untuk merenovasi apartemen ini kalau membaca ini jadi ingat nama majalah itu popular jadi penasaran juga memangnya lanjutannya foto sexy ini seperti apa ya
4639457 wah kalau dikatakan lanjutan apa ya lanjutan dari pakai pakaian lengkap terus bikini terus ya mungkin tinggal pakaian dalam ya terus bugil kali ya
4639458 kita jangan lihat buku ini di sini nanti kita pamit ke non olga untuk malam dulu di warung bawah seolah olah kita sudah lapar di kamu sembunyikan album ini di jaketmu
4639459 kita ngapain pakai makan lagi masih kenyang lah bukannya tadi kita makan siangnya telat sampai jam tiga lebih
4639460 pakai otak sedikit tapi sudalah kalo kamu sih mending gak usah ikut mikir nanti tambah kacau yang jelas kalau mau enak diam dan ikuti saja aku dan dedi
4639461 non olga sepertinya kami harus makan dulu sudah terlalu lapar nih kami ke warung bawah sebentar non
4639462 buka lagi dong mau liat yang keliatan memeknya mau tau jembutan ga
4639463 yah kok ga ada yang ngangkang sih padahal pengen yang lebih jelas
4639464 gini kita kembali ke atas terus lihat perkembangan situasi di sana jangan bertindak gegabah
4639465 buku ini kita pakai saja buat memojokkan non olga pak
4639466 iya kan tadi aku sudah bilang kita lihat situasinya kalau memungkinkan kenapa tidak
4639467 wah bapak bapak habis makan apa sampai keringatan gitu kepedasan ya saya ambilkan minum dulu ya
4639468 non olga gimana dengan hasl kerja kami nggak buruk kan
4639469 kalau gitu kali kali ada kenalan non olga yang butuh renovasi tolong non olga kenalkan pada kami ya
4639470 kenalan non olga juga artis ya iya enak ya jadi artis
4639471 iya deh nanti kalo ada teman saya yang butuh bantuan bapak bapak saya pasti mengenalkan pada kalian dan tentang artis ada enaknya ada nggak enaknya juga lah apalagi kalau ada rekan artis lain yang iri kadang menggunakan segala cara untuk saling menjatuhkan
4639472 betul itu salah satu contohnya untungnya salah satu tokoh yang mengusung ini kebongkar rahasianya kalo ternyata moralnya juga nggak bener jadi pelan pelan suara suara yang pro jadi surut sendiri karena itu merupakan satu pukulan telak buat kubu pro ruu app
4639473 iya non saya jadi ingat dulu non olga termasuk yang keras menentang ruu app itu ya kenapa non
4639474 iya cuma gara gara ego orang yang sok suci yang berselisih dengan seorang artis wanita memanfaatkan popularitasnya yang waktu itu belum jatuh melontarkan ide yang jelas mengorbankan hak hak kaum wanita laki laki yang nggak bisa menahan diri untuk berpikiran atau berbuat mesum wanita yang disalahkan dengan alasan penampilan atau perbuatan yang mengundang hasrat itu kan keterlaluan lelucon yang sama sekali tidak lucu dari berbagai lelucon yang pernah saya dengar
4639475 untung saja seperti yang saya katakan tadi orang yang sok suci yang mengusung hal itu kebongkar rahasianya pintar sekali menutupi kalau dia itu punya hasrat yang begitu menggebu dengan cara berkoar koar tentang moral dan ruu app padahal sudah punya banyak istri masih pakai kimpoi siri sama artis muda itu kan menunjukkan kalau dirinya amat tidak tahan godaan hawa nafsu dengan kemunafikannya yang sudah kelewat batas itu maka saya merasa harus memprotes keras
4639476 protes yang non olga maksud itu dengan cara berpose seksi di majalah popular
4639477 pak kalau yang di majalah popular itu menurut saya bukan pose seksi yang bersifat porno pak tapi itu bersifat seni
4639478 pose seni itu termasuk yang di buku ini non olga
4639479 non olga kami sudah melihat tubuh non olga di dalam album ini tapi tentu saja lebih menyenangkan lagi kalau kami bisa melihat bentuk asli dari tubuh non olga nah non mau kan nunjukin tubuh non pada kami secara langsung di sini
4639480 tentu saja saya tak perlu menjelaskan lagi pada non olga bagaimana dengan album ini jika non olga berani macam macam sekali saya lempar ke bawah orang orang di sana akan dapat gempar dan besoknya infotainment di tv tak akan ketinggalan memberitakan hal ini juga
4639481 bapak bapak tolonglah saya punya duit kalian mau dibayar berapa
4639482 kalau soal duit itu gampang non memang harus bayar kami untuk tutup mulut tapi non juga harus tahu kami semua ingin mencicipi servis non juga
4639483 lepaskan pegangan kalian non olga sekarang non boleh pilih non mau buka baju non sendiri dengan sukarela atau kami bantuin non untuk membukanya
4639484 lho non olga kok pilih kasih sama yang jadi fotografer itu kami kan juga mau liat yang ada di dalam beha dan celana dalam non
4639485 tenang non olga pokoknya non olga nurut saja maka kami nggak akan berbuat kasar lagipula ingat soal album tadi jadi sebaiknya non olga layani kami tanpa berbuat yang macam macam
4639486 lho non olga kok nangis terus sih di tv katanya cuma bisa mimpi hahaha
4639487 cup cup non olga jangan nangis sini bapak cium ya
4639488 ya iyalah kalo ga mana bisa jadi artis atau model
