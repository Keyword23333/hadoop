6120000 gloriously funny in that dark and twisted charlie kaufman idiosyncratic manner its incredibly melancholy and seemingly autobiographical and its ending is fairly obtuse were hoping in the live execution the conclusion will be more poetically abstract than flat out confusing but well have to wait and see
6120001 this holiday season may well be the perfect storm for airfare that sends travelers running for cover
6120002 the combination of high fuel prices airline capacity and route cuts means holiday travelers may easily spend upwards of 100 more per ticket than last year there are deals out there for both thanksgiving and christmas but theyre few and far between and wont last long
6120003 in 2007 travelers found the best holiday fares in the second week of october
6120004 this year is a whole new game so i recommend anyone who needs to fly on peak travel days to buy as soon as they find a reasonable fare those who do have flexibility in their travel dates should monitor fares closely over the next few months and look for fare drops
6120005 one after another mccains answers were shallow simplistic and trite he showed the same intellectual curiosity that george w bush has virtually none
6120006 john mccain graduated 894th in a class of 899 at the naval academy at annapolis and it shows over and over again whenever mccain is called upon to think on his feet
6120007 i am sick and tired of the president of the united states embarrassing me
6120008 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself
6120009 tomorrow night is mostly cloudy with a 50 percent chance of thunderstorms
6120010 the winds shouldnt be very strong but that shouldnt matter if we have thunderstorms
6120011 the first half of the weekend is likely to be wet
6120012 winds will stay in the five to 10 mph range
6120013 michael probably wont be and mark viduka certainly wont be
6120014 i probably could rush michael back and then knock him back five or six weeks
6120015 i dont know where the carr story has come from i can categorically say no to that one
6120016 i keep hearing the brown rumour but theres nothing in it in fact i dont see us doing anything before the transfer window shuts
6120017 i was so desperate to download some porn that i could not keep either my hands or my eyes steady long enough to work out how to use it

6120019 incredible performance by usain bolt once again he finished up in an incredible time this was an incredible performance he wanted that record
6120020 he got an incredible start i looked at his start and just went wow it was more amazing than the 100 metres guys that tall should not be able to start like that
6120021 he wanted that record this is his favourite event he went for it he came in focused on it knowing he would most likely win the gold
6120022 my concern was he would not have the ability to hold that speed for the entire race but he showed he has been working on that he used every ounce of energy he wanted that record
6120023 auction charges need to be viable in order to provide the expanding range of services increasingly demanded by both auction buyers and sellers
6120024 i am in discussions with some big companies in the area of stents for strategic alliances mainly joint distribution of eurocors future stents in the u s
6120025 i cannot disclose the details but if talks progress we can sign an arrangement by the end of the year

6120028 its not go pack go its j e t s jets jets jets
6120029 i am very happy to say she is doing much better and though i am still very concerned i am cautiously optimistic of a full recovery

6120032 it would be a monumental task for moore and galloway to top their classic 1992 memoir but they come close in this sterling sequel

6120034 traveling back to the red dirt battlefields commanders and veterans from both sides make the long and difficult journey from old enemies to new friends
6120035 distillation of our combined 75 plus years of firsthand experience of wars and warriors and offers some lessons applicable to today
6120036 there never was a time when in my opinion some way could not be found to prevent the drawing of the sword
6120037 war is delightful to those who have no experience of it
6120038 it stands to reason that leaving your home without locking the doors or setting the alarm creates a risk for burglary but it can also affect your home contents cover should you come to claim
6120039 the day microsoft makes something that doesnt sign in before you can post messages
6120040 once in a while you can get shown the light
6120041 we have considerable reservations as do our players and the australian cricketers association
6120042 the icc understands the considerable reservations that australia new zealand england south africa and perhaps some others hold were hoping the icc will give us some advice we expect some sort of certainty within the next 24 hours about what the next step in this process is
6120043 we will not put pakistan in a situation if we get specialist advice that tells us that its not safe to travel
6120044 the security advice however does not give us any great encouragement at the moment
6120045 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
6120046 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
6120047 what we have done is to very clearly outline to each of these stakeholders the plan that we have in place for the champions trophy in pakistan
6120048 understandably there are safety concerns and thats what we are engaged in and we are dealing with
6120049 the ecb has received a briefing from us and have gone into a board meeting they will consider our briefing among other reports that they may have on whether they will participate or not but that is a decision for the ecb as far as the icc are concerned the safety and security is satisfactory for hosting the tournament in pakistan
6120050 its something i would not be able to tell you at this point i would like to think that the member boards would not send weakened sides because no life is lesser than another either you send your best side or you decide the advice tells you differently but having said that i think its a position the icc will have to deal with when they see the extent of weakened teams again its speculative at this time
6120051 the selectors are comfortable this move will maintain the competitive edge for the australian side and provide a wonderful opportunity for geeves to join the group for the first time

6120053 zaheer did the job for us as he bowled in right areas credit also goes to badrinath as he had not played before
6120054 we needed this victory there was pressure on us especially after losing opener stiff neck before the match we would have liked to win comfortably but in the end it is about winning
6120055 we knew we could win this match only by getting wickets we tried hard but dhoni and badrinath batted really well and their partnership took the game away from us
6120056 the important thing was to be consistent and bowl in right areas
6120057 as a spearhead of the attack it was important for me to provide early breakthroughs all the bowlers did well and kept pressure on their batsmen
6120058 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
6120059 the important first step for the international cricket council was gaining recognition of the sport and of the council from the ioc
6120060 that is important particularly for many of our smaller nations because to belong to a sporting body that has recognition from the ioc improves their opportunity for funding
6120061 it is something that cricket has to think about very carefully
6120062 this visit these few days give us the opportunity to assess the potential for cricket becoming an olympic sport
6120063 2020 must be the earliest realistic date but i must emphasise the international cricket council has to consider its position just as the ioc has to consider its position
6120064 cricketers wont care about the money the chance to stand on top of the olympic podium to wear an olympic gold medal and the pride of belting out your national anthem would be a life changing experience
6120065 marching in an olympic games opening ceremony might give individual cricketers goosebumps
6120066 but as part of the evolution of the game it wouldnt raise a pimple on the backside
6120067 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
6120068 the selectors are comfortable this move will maintain the competitive edge for the australian side and provide a wonderful opportunity for brett geeves to join the australian group for the first time
6120069 we look forward to brett lee rejoining the group as soon as possible
6120070 our advice would be that if you want private coverage get it early in life when it should be cheaper and try and keep it if you change jobs
6120071 dont miss out on available funding that they wont have to repay
6120072 it reduces the stress and the work considerably and puts your financial life back on track sooner

6120091 fueron ep tetos grotescos obscenos que no podemos decirlos al aire
6120092 esa es la idea estamos con dos puntos menos con relaci n a las dos eliminatorias anteriores y eso nos obliga a buscar los puntos que se han resignado en casa ahora jugando de visitantes vamos a trabajar para lograrlo

6120094 en esa preparaci n nos vamos a enfrentar con un equipo como colombia en un juego m s de los tantos que hemos jugado y buscando encontrar un buen nivel para los partidos oficiales
6120095 colombia va por buen camino es una de las dos selecciones invictas en el torneo no conocen la derrota han conseguido puntos por fuera que es bueno para las aspiraciones de un mundial
6120096 as que esperemos que por ser naciones vecinas ser a importante y fabuloso estar en sud frica cada una debe pelear lo suyo y hacer lo necesario para estar ah ojal que lo podamos lograr

6120112 the apocalyptic opening lines seem to capture the beleaguered mindset of the uk
6120113 the mcc is now like an upper chamber of cricket somewhat removed from the political and promotional issues which are negotiated by the world governing body international cricket council icc and the national cricket boards such as the west indies cricket board and the england and wales cricket board
6120114 as such the mcc can rightly have an important role in cricket akin to the house of lords in england
6120115 the mcc is still the guardians of the rules of cricket
6120116 it now has a world cricket committee so it can act as part of the conscience of the game without setting itself up as the pinnacle of self righteousness
6120117 the highest priority should be given to getting as many decisions as possible right
6120118 without rivalry sport would not get off the ground so there is a need for healthy rivalry between respected individuals and in many contexts rivalry is a necessary feature of life
6120119 it supports proper ambition and it helps develops a full self but healthy rivalry requires a degree of separation
6120120 match fixing treats everyone and the game itself in contempt
6120121 whether you walk or not in or out you should get off the field as quickly as possible and get on with the game
6120122 the mcc takes pride in not only cricket but making sure cricket should be played in the right way
6120123 the ring of fire will allow cricket to be played during the cooler evenings and replicate natural daylight
6120124 the revolutionary design will create ideal playing conditions and add to the atmosphere inside the ground
6120125 dubai sports city is close to hosting the first ever international cricket tournament to be staged in dubai there are many national cricket governing bodies that have expressed a strong interest to bring their teams to play at the dubai sports city cricket stadium
6120126 the icc future tours programme allows very few windows of opportunity but having said that we are hopeful of reaching an agreement soon and making an announcement in the not too distant future about the opening cricket event
6120127 we are in discussions with various cricket boards to have events here in 2009 like odi series
6120128 indeed we are looking at twenty20 very hard we are in talks to have the twenty20 champions league here at some point of time
6120129 in patrick we have one of the brightest most creative executives in our group
6120130 i came to tell you that the work that you are doing here is essential
6120131 the best way to be loyal to your comrades is to continue your work is to raise your heads to be professional
6120132 why are we here it is because here we play a part in the freedom of the the world here we are fighting against terrorism
6120133 the rise in violence is attributed directly to our lack of attention the allies and all of us to the sanctuaries to the training grounds to the financial resources of terrorists and the
6120134 and unless we do that we will continue to suffer
6120135 to our fans it is with huge regret and disappointment that we have been forced to cancel our imminent european festival appearances at leeds reading 2 days a week area 4 as well as exclusive performances for mtv europe and virgin tv the other night joey jordison broke his ankle and doctors have advised joey to stay off his leg for 4 6 weeks to prevent further injury or permanent and more serious damage we know you will be hugely disappointed and so are we canceling shows is never an easy decision and we apologize to all our fans friends and family for not being there to throw down with you we will be back in europe this november and cant wait to see you all then slipknot
6120136 this convention in denver is one is which people well known and people not as well known will come together across party lines across geographic divides because they believe in change

6120148 at this juncture all our community needs an new generation of leadership
6120149 those in office all these years have to hold some responsibility for this predicament
6120150 the state is home to 640 public authorities and ineffective economic development initiatives
6120151 if elected i promise to question the economic necessity of these programs and many others and fight for the repeal of the state gas tax
6120152 seriously and exactly how is she living her faith tithing working for the poor saving the environment dont think so id be great if she put some actions where her mouth is
6120153 im not in a position to confirm or deny that
6120154 obviously its a personal matter and brett is working through that
6120155 the selectors are comfortable this move will maintain the competitive edge for the australian side and provide a wonderful opportunity for brett geeves to join the australian group for the first time
6120156 we look forward to brett lee rejoining the group as soon as possible
6120157 both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increase and needs to increase sooner rather than later
6120158 what can i say im the luckiest girl in the world
6120159 shes officially off the market no one else gets her and now shell cook and clean for me
6120160 i got married to portia de rossi sorry john stamos this ones taken
6120161 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model
6120162 as weve moved the technology from japan to china weve seen a decrease in reliability thats not to say that because it comes from china its of inferior quality but i dont think anyone would be surprised to learn that quality varies widely in chinese factories
6120163 we just havent been able to practise our variations such as slower balls yorkers and death bowling
6120164 j cheguei conclus o que de manh s estou bem na caminha
6120165 seront au programme ce soir avec un tour de france des trois grandes r gions viticoles et la d couverte des familles qui ont bati un empire sur le vin

6120168 he is a natural player hes a big guy strong very fast very quick he plays the game natural he plays it naturally low he can bend his knees and he plays the game low
6120169 its good to have shawn back hes working hard and preparing hard well see what happens here i think andy is taking it day to day here but well see what happens
6120170 booker has to make sure he factors in the weather conditions know that theres a bit of a wind thats going to move the ball a bit so its going to change that setup point for you
6120171 but thats just a matter of experience and the more reps he can get at it the better simulate that in practice situations get some windy days and well catch some balls
6120172 we went 15 games after that first game where we didnt have any ball security issues so i think we are well on track to where we need to be weve brought in two guys that we feel very confident in with both desean and quintin demps catching punts back there
6120173 weve moved on we feel confident in what weve got were ready to go forward from here
6120174 they are pulling out burnt corpses the plane has been completely destroyed
6120175 how many people think you are better off than you were eight years ago
6120176 they are going to say he is young and hes got a funny name and hes not patriotic enough weve seen this campaign before it works for republicans because it feeds into the real cynicism that people have about government
6120177 i think on all these issues taxes and spending the whole thing boils down to who is ready to lead
6120178 sen obama would have the federal government increase all sorts of taxes
6120179 michael probably wont be and mark viduka certainly wont be
6120180 i probably could rush michael back and then knock him back five or six weeks
6120181 the grey gloomy skies turned out to be a fitting backdrop for a night of fantastically moody stormy music from englands radiohead
6120182 only the hardest hearted of hair metal haters could defuse poisons explosive greatest hits set
6120183 the three groups dont appear to have much in common except hitting the big time in the 1970s but the music blended smoothly together nonetheless classic rock does that trick
6120184 i dont know where the carr story has come from i can categorically say no to that one
6120185 i keep hearing the brown rumour but theres nothing in it in fact i dont see us doing anything before the transfer window shuts
6120186 in principle yes we have not thought of it yet no such proposal has been received in any case all similar projects must be first studied by military experts and when everything is decided we will make an open and public announcement
6120187 la parola di una showgirl vale meno di quella di un politico
6120188 lattacco alla donna stato vergognoso mara una collega e sono stata felice quando stata eletta parlamentare perch viene dal nostro ambiente che da sempre considerato a torto superficiale e immorale e una persona capace ma poi per troppa ambizione forse ha fatto il passo pi lungo della gamba
6120189 mi auguro di no anche se mi hanno detto che non sta passando un bel momento questo mi dispiace
6120190 berlusconi ha detto che bisogna stringere i denti no non tu mara
6120191 toccher alla magistratura stabilire se quella della guzzanti satira o diffamazione io sono serena ho presentato querela aspetter che sia un giudice a decidere chi di noi due ha ragione
6120192 sapevo che da ministro avrei dovuto pagare il costo della diffidenza e della presunzione di incapacit ma mai avrei pensato che si potesse arrivare a tali bassezze o denigrazioni
6120193 ho vissuto quei momenti con tenacia e serenit consapevole che anche quegli attacchi per quanto grevi e meschini facessero parte del gioco chi ha scatenato la campagna stampa nei miei confronti lha fatto per invidia e frustrazione
6120194 non ha importanza chiunque esso sia per me acqua passata ho spalle larghe e nervi saldi io chiedo soltanto di essere giudicata dagli opinionisti e dagli elettori al termine del mandato da ministro per i fatti non per le chiacchiere o laspetto fisico
6120195 once again the majority of our negative estimate revisions are being driven by higher than estimated write downs on mortgage assets
6120196 also seeing results being negatively impacted by slower levels of client activity and expenses and fines from auction rate securities
6120197 with this as a backdrop a lower level of corporate and institutional activity is likely to ensue until the financial markets stabilize
6120198 irene and abes very generous contribution is by far the largest single gift ever received by the society for progressive supranuclear palsy and certainly the most important for cbd research in the history of the society
6120199 theres no need to discuss innocence or guilt we know hes guilty
6120200 the sigh of the oppressed creature the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions the opium of the people
6120201 it is only when the threat of popular participation is overcome that democratic forms can be safely contemplated
6120202 never have the well worn tactics of democracy promotion been applied with more devastating effect than in haiti between 2000 and 2004
6120203 keeping on top of legislative and regulatory requirements is a critical responsibility made more difficult because compliance efforts are still operating in project mode and have not yet been embedded into business processes it projects still lack alignment with business objectives at many organizations and as a result they are unable to realize business benefits
6120204 what this woman has done has not just broke my heart she has hurt a lot of people
6120205 im just going to pray that justice will be served
6120206 obviously he was at the wrong place at the wrong time
6120207 when you work at a school youre like a proud parent watching them grow up for four years and youre happy to see them leave
6120208 we are not here because chad died we are here because chad lived
6120209 i will remember chad singing as much as he spoke
6120210 he would come into the office and just belt out a tune you couldnt help but laugh
6120211 those are things that coming into the season as coaches you say i hope these guys are our leaders because ive seen them do things in the past but really until you get on the field you dont really know
6120212 but theyve been as good as advertised as far as leading the group making calls making adjustments making sure guys are going at the tempo that we want them to go at theyve been doing a good job in that aspect
6120213 i think were playing the run much better than weve played it
6120214 we know who the guys that are our leaders so to speak its easier for us as a defense to kind of focus in on what we are and what we need to do in order to be a good team this year
6120215 theres always more so if theyre playing at a high level okay play at a higher level
6120216 we dont want to just be okay we dont want to be good we want to be at this level we expect everybody no matter who we put out there to kind of take the lead and make plays
6120217 its critical because guys force and they fit you scrape and sometimes you pass things off so you have to be on the same page
6120218 when youve got two good pass rushers on the edge
6120219 now all of a sudden theres another guy inside that you have to deal with and that adds another dimension to your defense
6120220 quinny is the next best stack linebacker so hes the next guy in
6120221 steve quinn is a guy thats a very instinctive football player
6120222 toryan is a little bit different in the aspect of hes more of an inside billy goat gruff guy
6120223 if there are going to be two backs coming at you right now that is his forte
6120224 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything
6120225 i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6120226 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think that its all part of the healing
6120227 not everything was lily white not everything was sweet and nice
6120228 this collection is a great achievement and a testament to aces love of this region and his appreciation for the art of this region
6120229 ace will be considered a pioneer collector of early texas art somebody who recognized the quality and value of these works and was one of the earliest and most successful and passionate collectors
6120230 that was six months ago and i damn sure dont look like a corpse
6120231 i dont want to speak out of turn but if there was a serious effort on the part of fort worth i dont know that ace wouldnt step up and do his part as well and not for personal aggrandizement he would do it because its the right thing to do
6120232 in god we trust and yet youve got a chain and a whip
6120233 how would you like to be pulled from your wife and sold under god we trust horse shit god didnt have nothing to do with it
6120234 you got to understand thats what this collection is about
6120235 this is what ive tried to show the early texas artists were the very first to kick down the ugly door to segregation it wasnt the preachers african americans couldnt go to a white church they couldnt drink out of white fountains they couldnt go to a movie
6120236 maybe i started looking at things a little different i didnt start out to build my collection like this i was a pawnbroker and saw the plight of people who worked and i studied how hard it was on them and what a hypocrite i had been earlier in life thinking these people were nothing but deadbeats who relied on the government id begun to realize that these people were human beings no different than i made by the same creator that created me and i started thinking about my collection and how i wanted to build it
6120237 if the right persons had seen it theyd have beat the hell out of chandor because this entire area dallas fort worth the brazos bottoms was loaded with ku klux klan
6120238 theyd have made damn sure chandor never set his yankee ass back in weatherford thats what makes alphonso so great some people look at it and say thats a nice painting they dont have any idea they dont even feel it
6120239 old women dont but old men do we have a tendency to shuck off our armor our bulletproof vests the bullshit that surrounds us and show our true emotions
6120240 you think back on the sins youve committed the things youve said and done the lies youve told and the people and creatures youve hurt and you feel a deep sorrow
6120241 i used to be an alcoholic you think that was neat for my family i used to be a gutter rat somebody thats not worth nothing
6120242 im not that important nobody is its about how precious life is you dont realize it until you know you are on the edge
6120243 if he gets you in the corner hes gonna kill you
6120244 he can kill you but you can only put him back in his cage temporarily youre not ever rid of him when youre where im at stage four cancer
6120245 most of the people who say that i would classify primarily as dumb asses
6120246 sometimes people cheat themselves other times ive given people more than they were asking because they were naming prices so ridiculously low that i couldnt in good conscience do it but when it comes to horse trading im not ashamed to say i can hold my own with them especially when they are eat up with the dumb ass
6120247 i said how much is the damn horse he said they wanted 40 000 for him i said thats a lot of horse
6120248 a good early texas painting will always outgrow any stock you have
6120249 at amp t stock you can buy every day of the damn week i cant buy a frank reaugh every day of the week they dont come along
6120250 i brought attention to the working class people in this state and attention to very rare native american mexican or spanish and african american artists that painted here but were not recognized
6120251 ive sought these works out theyve been hard to find but i found them when i look at them i feel a sense of accomplishment that ive done something worthwhile and people can see them and understand the toils and how hard it was for these people
6120252 when youre in a death match you dont have time to get involved
6120253 i dont have time to worry about small shit i have to worry about living and getting the most out of it
6120254 these museums are terrified somebody is going to think they are a bunch of rubes if they show something native to the state
6120255 hes a zealot and hell preach to anybody whos willing to listen he preaches the gospel of early texas art and fortunately there are people willing to sit in his congregation and im one of them ive been sitting in the front pew since 1989 when i met him
6120256 in terms of quality depth and breadth it is the finest collection of early texas art in private hands
6120257 ace only picks the best and if he doesnt have the best he upgrades until he does theres a perception that he is only interested in ethnic artists but really he just wants them included in the conversation its unfathomable to him when they are not included and most of the time they have not been
6120258 all it takes is an angel an angel with a big pocketbook
6120259 its hard to tell in this economy the way things may go but a number of people have expressed interest in the collection and ace seems committed to finding somebody who will keep it together so it can be seen
6120260 whether it will stay in fort worth remains to be seen
6120261 hes rough around the edges you bet but hes also got the best eye of any collector i know
6120262 you wouldnt know it by talking to him because hes not going to let you know that he puts on that yosemite sam persona and the glitterati of fort worth dont want anything to do with that but if the collection is not kept intact and kept in an institution and it ought to be in fort worth texas we will look back and lament the fact that we didnt find a way to keep it together
6120263 i dont think he even knows how many pieces are in it
6120264 ive seen the paintings up on the bull ring wall but im impressed anew as you put them up and start lighting them with how strong they are
6120265 its powerful stuff and something that people can understand immediately
6120266 its just scenes of simple living people working jobs and doing everyday things it makes me glad somebody got out there and caught what was happening things that some other people might have looked down on
6120267 this aint the first time ive had my ass hung out over a fence but never this far
6120268 but thats just an adrenalin rush and in a day and a half its gone not like now i wake up at one or two every morning and i ask jesus christ to help guide and strengthen me i didnt do that after the adrenalin rushes
6120269 i have great faith in the almighty and jesus christ and im going to go where he leads me
6120270 im not looking for a miracle if we want a miracle well wish something for the children down there at cook hospital certainly not for some old worn out person like myself
6120271 putting together the collection was an interest to me but it wasnt the sum total of me
6120272 its not like cutting off an arm im in another phase in my life im in my 70s fighting a rare and deadly cancer now that im in this fight its another trip for me
6120273 and we were waiting to work with them to coordinate with the schools
6120274 the reason were doing this is because were adding more meeting coverage on 12
6120275 i do think it the law is a good idea
6120276 not a law to grant the town board authority it doesnt already have the purpose of the law is to fill a gap and provide due process rights and protections
6120277 this is something we can now give to appointed board members so they know what is expected

6120298 it should be noted that the passage of this bill will not be retroactive
6120299 philadelphias historical commission has no legal means to protect famous interiors such as the wanamaker grand court the academy of music and the boyd theatre from severe alteration or demolition
6120300 the bill would only affect the public portions of buildings such as lobbies and would not apply to private residences
6120301 certainly be complicated i imagine the historical commission holding a series of public hearings
6120302 at this juncture all our community needs an new generation of leadership
6120303 those in office all these years have to hold some responsibility for this predicament
6120304 the state is home to 640 public authorities and ineffective economic development initiatives
6120305 if elected i promise to question the economic necessity of these programs and many others and fight for the repeal of the state gas tax
6120306 i urged him to move ahead in the israel syria negotiations as much as possible so that whoever is the next president would not start from too far down the track
6120307 i did not say anything about obama or mccain i said whoever is the next president is not going to want to inherit a process that isnt going anywhere
6120308 but its not a secret that the syrians are openly banking on barack obama its not surprising that they would build bridges in advance and do this through the window of the peace process
6120309 none of us thought we were being used or abused

6120314 es dificil simo que haya una incorporaci n aunque es l gico que se hable de todo esto por la poca en que estamos estamos contentos con lo que tenemos con los que se ven y con todos los chicos de lezama cada vez que vemos un entrenamiento nos transmiten que hay mucha materia prima

6120317 con la readaptaci n al grupo ahora veo los frutos de haber trabajado todo el verano
6120318 es una operaci n bastante complicada en la que no se puede hablar de plazos
6120319 para nosotros es muy positivo que la l nea de juego sea la misma el entrenador gregorio manzano tiene una idea de juego y el equipo la est respetando m s all de qui n est en el campo a pesar de que se hayan ido jugadores importantes el equipo trata de jugar de la misma forma se est formando un buen grupo

6120325 what we are seeing from the russians is the cold blooded calculated premeditated murder of a small nation
6120326 what is going on now in georgia is a test case this is about the russian view of the new world order versus the west view of the new world order if russia wins it will validate the russian view of the new world order
6120327 saakashvili regime may be landlocked by the end of tuesday or wednesday russia just made it clear what it thinks of bushco pipeline dreams and bushco vision of the new world order of course their co conspirators over in dc are calling it a disproportionate response

6120329 wang xiuying is almost blind and crippled what sort of reeducation through labor can she serve
6120330 but they can also be taken away at any time
6120331 this is part of the tough tactics used to intimidate and silence protesters
6120332 of course its of concern that china will use a system thats clearly beyond the pale in terms of international standards in terms of arbitrary deprivation of freedoms and liberties to do that
6120333 we have no records of these two names in our system
6120334 malaysias policy options are wider than the us the eu european union and japan and if you use these policies wisely you can overcome them without difficulty or pain
6120335 if the inflation target by the central bank is credible the expected inflation rate will be anchored at around the target rate
6120336 i have sent a cassation appeal to the supreme court against a judgement to e zeltser delivered by the minsk city court
6120337 a cassation appeal against judgements to e zeltser and russian citizen vladlena funk were sent to the supreme court by registered mail
6120338 unfortunately the results of nomination have upset me as well 365 contenders thats how many we had at the bottom line at the moment of elections in october 2004
6120339 we certainly will do our best to preserve this competitiveness
6120340 however there are violations that allow the commission to deny registration but do not bind to do so
6120341 for instance the matter could concern incorrectness in the declaration of income and property that is why we shall show maximum flexibility where possible
6120342 of course in the end the shareholders will decide or make the final decision but this is related to the technicality and capacity of proton what had been implemented by proton at this time and the actions taken
6120343 measures have been taken to improve protons capacity and it is showing results
6120344 some proton cars are designed with the latest technology and is better than before this is making the national car more popular
6120345 proton management will also weigh the options of a partner because shareholders always think of returns but in technical terms the shareholders still depend on the management of proton
6120346 the growth comes mainly from our 1 3 plan and our celcom executive plan both plans have been a huge success for us in fact more than 200 000 of our post paid customers are using the 1 3 plan

6120353 we look forward to other positive steps from the belarusian authorities that could open the possibility of a significant improvement in relations between the united states and belarus
6120354 it is good news indeed that andrei kim and syarhei parsyukevich are released next to kazulin the leading role in release of the political prisoners belongs to the consistent and firm position of the united states that didnt retract from its own line even after boorish pressure on the us embassy in minsk it were the sanctions imposed by the us and linking their lifting to release of political prisoners that have forced the belarusian authorities adopt these decisions besides the firm stance of the democratic forces of belarus who had been constantly highlighting demands to release political prisoners and stop repressions as well as international solidarity with belarusian democrats which has made it possible for zmitser dashkevich artur finkevich andrei klimau yury lyavonau mikalay autukhovich syarei parsyukevich andrei kim alyaksandr kazulin to be released
6120355 today i have been summoned to the head of the colony he told me to be ready for release i was given 15 minutes to pack my things i didnt even had enough time for that i was told i am released by lukashenkas decree
6120356 i think the regime wants the eu to recognize the
6120357 it was a shock for me to see what is going on in the colony the most important thing the aim is to humiliate and crush a person there
6120358 i have asthma and gastric ulcer and it was especially difficult in the remand prison in valadarski street in minsk it is very moist there when the temperature is high its hot to suffocation doctors are no good there they can only give you pills which they have they didnt have pills for me later i was brought medicines but their function is to cure not to allow bringing pills
6120359 the law on political parties provides a term of 10 days for filing documents to the ministry of justice and article 38 of the election code provides a term of 3 days to give information on request of district election commissions

6120361 the council of europe in the person of its president the council of europe parliamentary assembly osce office in minsk have repeatedly said that it is natural in any country when people protest against falsification the election results
6120362 i am ready to go back to prison if a charter of pardon is abolished
6120363 my moral principles dont afford me to accept a pardon i would never left prison until andrei kim and syarhei parsyukevich were released they would have needed to throw me from prison by force
6120364 i refuse to be pardoned because it is a humiliation i take my release as a sign of justice but i dont accept it in the way it was made
6120365 i was said my father in law had died then the first deputy prison chief said i had half an hour to gather my personal things books and photos
6120366 i something happened to me it wont be due to his fault and initiative
6120367 i am as careful as a can today i am prudent and careful
6120368 the us authorities are still seriously concerned by the state of health of emanuel zeltser and continue to urge the belarusian regime to release him
6120369 berezovsky tried to intimidate zeltser demanding emanuel to palinode and change his testimony in behalf of berezovsky
6120370 it would be worse for you as i am the master of this country
6120371 the essence of the letter is out of their sphere
6120372 we dont understand why belarusian authorities are keeping such modest silence issues like these require clearer expression especially from allies
6120373 to take steps to improve relations with the eu and us
6120374 i want to thank you for the courage you have shown
6120375 done everything in such a way as to make the whole world squirm
6120376 for 3 hours i and the head of hrodna branch of the union of poles in belarus myachyslau yaskevich are kept at the border and we cannot go to poland

6120380 to send alyaksandr kazulin to prison basing on fabricated accusations
6120381 lukashenka cannot understand that in any country considered democratic citizens have a right to protest against rigged election results

6120398 i accept release as a sign of justice but i cannot accept pardon on the moral and ethical grounds i hadnt committed a criminally punishable act my family and i have undergone cruelest repressions from the state and the political regime such a justification of the release is humiliating not only for me only my unconditional release and a full rehabilitation as an innocent as well as immediate release of andrei kim and syarhei parsyukevich could be viewed as a truly real step by the belarusian state towards democratization of the society i express sincere gratitude to all who had been fighting for my release who is fighting for release of all political prisoners i think that the rest of the political prisoners are to be released in the short term and that would close the chapter on the institute of political prisoners in belarus
6120399 he was pardoned on august 16 by a decree o the president
6120400 i am sincerely happy that alyaksandr kazulin is released in fact a cynical verdict of a weak willed unprofessional court was reversed this courageous person has gone through terrible ordeals and hold out he has defended not only his honour and dignity but rights of hundreds thousands of citizens of the country who want changes
6120401 the only way of democratic changes in the country is step by step fulfillment of 12 recommendations of the european union immediate release of all political prisoners cessation of any political repressions changing the conditions of carrying out elections
6120402 alyaksandr kazulins release could be welcomed but further steps towards improvement of the atmosphere in the society and towards democratization of the situation in belarus in general should follow after that
6120403 i have submitted by documents to be registered as a deputy at precinct no

6120407 nudge us to some not simple actions in the framework of the union state
6120408 continuation of work on forming a common economic space and reinforcing of the foundations of the international ties are on the agenda of the talks in this respect the priority is given to keeping to agreements on step by step transition to principles of market formation of prices in trade and economic cooperation achieved earlier including the sphere of fuel and energy
6120409 the issues discussed in this context are aimed at giving an additional impulse to further integration processes and making mutually beneficial investments
6120410 this insignificant number demonstrates that we cannot speak about any positive changes during this election campaign the tendencies are al following forming precinct election commissions was carried out in a closed manner lists of members of precinct election commissions were made beforehand observers were not allowed to be present at sessions of commissions a territorial principle was used many members of election commissions work at the same enterprise which makes it easy to control them
6120411 our human rights activists received this list on august 6 that means long before the procedure of forming commissions finished we waited for the commissions to be formed and compared to the list and it happened that it coincides for more than 90 it means despite of the fact that formally commissions should be elected all of them were formed earlier
6120412 we are to face another catastrophe of democratic character of the electoral process precinct commissions carry out votes count and in fact rigging
6120413 agreed to carry to completion the work on the intergovernmental agreement on creation a single air defence system which is to be signed during this session

6120433 i am very honoured to have been given the vote of confidence from the three gcc gulf cooperation council members shareholders to steer asian finance bank to the next level
6120434 the first year was billed as the foundation year when the focus was all about building systems processes and the right team of people

6120437 we are now monitoring the fuel price in the international market and i hope it will continue its downward trend
6120438 it is still too early we still have about ten days to go and i hope there will be no more increase in the price of fuel
6120439 however if it goes higher we will still maintain the current pump price
6120440 we are open to evaluating the deal but we will wait to see the terms if they are attractive

6120451 as with all structured investments issued by cimb group market select comes with the assurance of liquidity

6120457 should the increase be above 10 per cent we expect industry volumes to be further impacted
6120458 historically the companies tend to use this opportunity to bump up their margins
6120459 we have to balance any increase in price against consumer affordability so as not to accelerate or drive consumers to illegal cigarettes because they are already impacted by the pressures of rising global fuel and food prices

6120469 penndot has very limited interest in building a limited access highway unless absolutely necessary
6120470 the financial reality argues in favor of improving traffic times by using the existing highway

6120481 at the same time we wanted something the kids would feel like it belonged to them and this is something thats very appealing to them so we tried to blend those two worlds it plays like clue it feels like clue but it just feels like clue that would have been created in the 21st century

6120496 the mx 900 has been a real workhorse for so many of our dealers over the years and it will remain available
6120497 with the mx 880 we are enabling dealers who rely on the monochrome mx 900 to seamlessly upgrade to a color model that will really connect with their clients the best part is that all of the programming work they have done for the mx 900 is completely portable to the mx 880 theres no need to redo macros or learned codes if you know the mx 900 already theres absolutely no learning curve
6120498 because of gps cell phones and mp3 players consumers now expect vibrant color screens on all handheld electronics

6120505 h istorical trends in medicare spending show that spending growth is entirely amenable to policy interventions
6120506 if beginning in 2005 excess growth in medicare spending matched the 1975 1983 rate medicare spending would reach 15 4 percent of gdp in 2030 an almost sixfold increase
6120507 if instead excess growth from 2005 on matched the 1997 2005 rate medicare spending as a share of gdp would equal 4 5 percent in 2030 the difference in projected gdp of 10 9 percentage points is more than half as large as current total federal outlays as a share of gdp 19 9
6120508 coincided with a substantial and sustained reduction in medicare hospital spending
6120509 spending trends in postacute care are highly sensitive to medicares payment and regulatory policies
6120510 if we acknowledge and accept that trends in medicare spending are under our control then we can move on to the more meaningful questions of what those trends should look like and how public funds can be spent more beneficially

6120534 no one really wants to pay tax everybody wants an exemption everybody wants a credit but weve got services that government has to provide and everybody wants the services
6120535 we have to say where is the money coming from
6120536 you have a certain amount of expense everybody needs to share it
6120537 and thats the real issue is how do we equitably share the tax burden in this state

6120563 its nice to have fast growing companies but if you cant buy them at the right price it doesnt make sense
6120564 were able to buy many of these companies at a much cheaper rate relative to their growth
6120565 you have to spend time trying to understand the company
6120566 also want to make sure firms have a handle on expenses

6120568 reflective of whats happened in the global economy in the last five years
6120569 the key point that brill and viard neglect to note or discuss is that even in their cherry picked example higher marginal tax rates bring along offsetting benefits to families with lower and middle incomes
6120570 virtually the whole government debt story is due to projections of exploding health care costs
6120571 what pretense to assert as did kenneth griffin recipient last year of more than 1 billion in compensation as manager of the citadel investment group that the current income distribution has to stand if the tax became too high as a matter of principle i would not be working this hard right far better to admit as has warren buffett that the tax rates of the wealthiest americans average nearly 15 while those of their salaried and therefore less incentivized assistants just outside their offices are nearly twice that
6120572 so the major themes of these two plans are in the case of senator mccains plan that the major emphasis is on economic efficiency cuts in marginal tax rates improves economic incentives
6120573 in the case of obamas plan the goal is primarily to improve progressivity to lower tax burdens on low income people and raise them on higher income people

6120598 pacific island countries are saying to the countries of the world including australia including the united states including the europeans including the chinese and the indians that the time for action concrete action over climate change is now
6120599 tuvalu has been crying out about the dire effects of climate change and rising sea levels but nothing concrete nothing tangible has been done to mitigate the problems that they encounter
6120600 there appears to be this concept that climate change is something that is happening out there in the future but it is impacting countries in the region now especially the small island countries

6120653 teachers from across the country are reporting they are spending less on clothes waiting for sales and sometimes changing where they shop even after some taking summer jobs to offset the increasing cost of living according to an informal survey by wwd
6120654 because country names on the front must be written in the latin alphabet countries like china compensate by using chinese characters on the back flags and sponsor logos must be in a certain place and a certain size the colors are regulated
6120655 the apparent benefit of the lzr which has a novel hydrodynamic construction that compresses the body into a tube reducing drag while at the same time improving muscle performance became apparent in national olympic trials

6120657 maureens story drew on many reliable sources some on the record and some on background we stand by its accuracy
6120658 you dont have an issue of sweat and sand collecting in places that you dont want it to
6120659 it really is the most functional uniform for beach volleyball
6120660 the ufc champ is not the stongest fighter in the world just a tough guy what can work the rules
6120661 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
6120662 somebodys got to walk the line in the country theyve got to walk it unapologetically and im sure johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
6120663 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt
6120664 it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform
6120665 we need good comprehensive development and planning and we are not getting that in the south and west loop
6120666 we need for development to cool down to keep the neighborhood hot
6120667 im relieved that the appropriate decision was made after an unfortunate incident
6120668 the first time in the history of the city of chicago that a residential planned development which had received all the necessary approvals including that of the city council went to market and then was threatened by downzoning
6120669 even though its almost all done things can go wrong and people would hold the city liable
6120670 this is the date were shooting at but thats up to the city they want to make sure everything is perfect and it is
6120671 when deciding whether to allow occupancy the safety and well being of all occupants is our first concern
6120672 i believe the developer was clear from the beginning that they were looking at a phased development it was built into the design of the building
6120673 a little over 100 are being trained as we speak
6120674 there will be no impact on the hotel experience in the building
6120675 silverleaf will have a positive impact on the character of the area because of the combination of new construction and landscaping on the property enhancing the areas aesthetic character and increasing neighborhood residential property values

6120685 we get a new easy to use e mail marketing software to migrate our customers onto
6120686 and an additional 200 customers that we can market our sms mobile and voice broadcast services to
6120687 we are very disproportionate as it compares to our league to have four scholarships at one position
6120688 these are a lot more than places for people to store their cars
6120689 people will be able to express their personalities in each garage
6120690 about a third of them that come in just want a man cave
6120691 were talking about what kind of stone we want or about custom made wrought iron doors
6120692 were kind of like a bunch of ladies sitting around and talking about fabrics but instead its guys
6120693 all of these proposed projects that arent close to hitting their pre sale arent going to happen which will obviously constrain supply
6120694 it will stop the potential additional building and thats a good thing for us and those of us that are under construction
6120695 at 757 orleans chicago they can buy a studio one bedroom or one bedroom plus a den in a highly desirable location for considerably less than they would in the gold coast
6120696 young working professionals who have been drawn to the gold coast have quickly found that its not feasible to purchase there instead theyre discovering river north where they can be in the middle of everything that the city offers while investing in a well appointed roomy new home they can afford they can save their money and still be within walking distance of the gold coast michigan avenue and have dozens of art galleries restaurants day spas and boutiques right in their immediate neighborhood
6120697 the building clears a lot of the surrounding structures which means that panoramic vistas of the city are included with many of the condominiums
6120698 were not aware that anything like that has been discussed and thats not the way that aon would deal with the city of chicago
6120699 downtown workers need to commute to the loop every day but theyd also like a quiet place to come home to at night
6120700 luckily there are a number of new developments under way in the suburbs in close proximity to metra train stations that bring people downtown in the morning while still giving them the opportunity to come home to a relaxing evening in the suburbs
6120701 the chicago area has a strong history as the transportation center of the midwest if not the country
6120702 with gas costs on the rise it is not always cheap to travel around the area especially sitting in rush hour traffic in the mornings and afternoons
6120703 sometimes its just less stressful and more affordable to take a 40 minute train ride to work instead of burning a tank full of gasoline
6120704 the convenience of public transportation close to your home is a major buying consideration and the ultimate solution for people who have to travel to the city for work
6120705 the waterford has brought city living to the suburbs with the new models showcasing sleek interiors with high end urban finishes upgraded stainless steel appliances and open floor plans with 10 foot soaring ceilings that evoke city style loft living
6120706 the two newly unveiled models feature exceptional interiors that resemble an urban loft residence near downtown chicago with luxury finishes and lofty light filled plans with open living areas
6120707 when completed in mid 2008 the everleigh community will feature condominium residences in a new construction nine story contemporary glass steel and brick mid rise building
6120708 getting to and from evanston is easy with its public transportation offerings
6120709 the ctas purple line el runs throughout evanston and metras union pacific north line has three stops in evanston both trains stop across the street from mainstreet station condominiums
6120710 i have the bad habit of trying to look backwards as im driving past
6120711 the better you can make the building the better it will perform economically
6120712 i knew the track was a fast track but i didnt think this was possible
6120713 it feel kind of weird it feels like a charity case
6120714 i think the age of the super skyscrapers is just starting again
6120715 we are now convinced that the age of skyscrapers is at an end
6120716 we are experiencing now a competition among the super talls that is unprecedented around the world
6120717 there are lots of people who will describe their national pride and sense of identity in terms of having the record for the worlds tallest building
6120718 theres been a lack of spending in those markets over the last few years
6120719 if customers arent willing to move in there its going to affect rents
6120720 the real innovations in high rise design are those buildings that are trying to take advantage of the environment
6120721 unbelievably evacuation and emergency preparedness were sorely lacking or totally nonexistent on 9 11
6120722 this along with critical flaws in the design and construction of the buildings contributed to the ominous conditions occupants found themselves in which ultimately claimed the lives of thousands
6120723 if we lose sight of the very things were trying to protect then in many respects weve allowed the terrorists to gain a victory
6120724 i have to experience living in a space like that
6120725 just the safety concerns just having someone you dont know come in
6120726 there isnt the same type of security there may be at a hotel they may be packing a bunch of people in a room they may be having a party you dont necessarily know
6120727 which means that basically anyone anywhere can do a search on the internet get a nightly unit in a residential building and basically move into your home
6120728 theres very little if any background screening required of the people that are able who are able to rent a unit in this building or any other building like it
6120729 we are getting more and more requests for short term rentals than we ever have in the past
6120730 eighty percent of the business we get is referral business a friend of a friend
6120731 youll never make any money just renting it unfurnished for a year
6120732 rocko is working in there at center and hes willing to put his face on somebody
6120733 when youre as young as he is and he hasnt played center before it can be tough making sure every snap is good but hes doing really well and becoming more consistent
6120734 theyre quicker than me faster we can always line up and race
6120735 theyre real explosive and theyre tough guys too you look at them and you think theyre undersized but they dont play like theyre small they play like their 6 2 even though theyre both 5 9 its exciting to watch them work because they work real hard theyre very explosive very quick and fast
6120736 i am extremely delighted and proud that you have won bronze medal in wrestling in the freestyle 66 kg category at the beijing olympics your determination grit and ambition for achievement have given the nation its second medal at these games you have proved that hard work will always bring laurels
6120737 i congratulate you on winning the bronze medal in the olympic games your achievement has brought joy and pride to the nation your accomplishment will inspire all young sportspersons of the country to excel in their chosen fields of endeavour
6120738 the women and children development ministry will seek answers from the raw taking cognisance of the incident
6120739 i am throwing away my job and everything to wind

6120744 with wes brown having the season he did last year i have to respect that
6120745 hell have no problems hell be offered a new contract im sure of that he is a remarkable person
6120746 my ambitions are the same as when i was 20 which is to get into the team and play in a team that wins trophies for manchester united
6120747 it will be difficult for me because there are players who did well last season and players who came through when i was out for 17 months but i know full well the level of performance i achieved before i was injured
6120748 my i suppose desire and determination is something within me which will not wane all i ask is to stay fit if i do it is up to me
6120749 i saw rafael make his first team debut against peterborough and i didnt particularly like what i saw
6120750 on a serious note he has absolutely fantastic potential his level of fitness and skill its the way the game is going now
6120751 us old solid right backs dont seem to be the way forward anymore its going in the other direction cafu and roberto carlos did it over the years theres evra now and english full backs have to take a lead from players like them
6120752 five or six years ago i changed my game by making a conscious decision to go forward more and get involved in attacks weve got to become more european in our thinking
6120753 there is always a case for keeping your back four as a solid unit especially in english football but modern full backs are becoming more like wide players with the midfielders there to cover

6120762 i do not know much but i have also heard about it
6120763 there was a guy who rang me and told me about rangers but i referred them only to my agent martin dahlin
6120764 after that i have not heard anything at all people are calling me about many things but i let martin take care of any items
6120765 michael probably wont be and mark viduka certainly wont be
6120766 i probably could rush michael back and then knock him back five or six weeks
6120767 i dont know where the carr story has come from i can categorically say no to that one
6120768 i keep hearing the brown rumour but theres nothing in it in fact i dont see us doing anything before the transfer window shuts

6120771 its something that takes two or three days to work
6120772 you need to apply it as soon as you feel it tingling
6120773 i recommend the three day course its the simplest and works as well as a seven day course of therapy
6120774 theyre meant to be used for just a two to three week period if the patient continues to have problems they should really talk to their doctor

6120795 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
6120796 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
6120797 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness
6120798 not only do i love playing shows but i also love riding roller coasters so this is the best of both worlds
6120799 i feel like i just kind of showed up on the scene and im nominated with more established artists theyre on their third single and im still kissing girls
6120800 id love to have a moonman everyone wants a moonman but i think this is just the beginning and if i get lucky enough to win im going to create a necklace out of it

6120820 sometimes i miss a dose of antiretroviral treatment when my husband comes back at six oclock drunk closes the door and says today you are going to freak out he locks me in he beats me up and locks me out of the house as a result of that i miss doses sometimes i feel very bad i dont even feel like taking the medicine
6120821 the strongest evidence out there right now is for the risk of overall mortality but we also see the association for a number of specific causes
6120822 now were starting to get insights into whats happening in the body when you dont get enough sleep
6120823 based on our findings we believe that if you lose sleep that your body needs then you produce these inflammatory markers that on a chronic basis can create low grade inflammation and predispose you to cardiovascular events and a shorter life span
6120824 weve really only scratched the surface when it comes to understanding whats going on regarding sleep and heart disease
6120825 i suspect as we understand more about this relationship well realize how important it really is
6120826 melatonin can prevent tumor cells from growing its cancer protective
6120827 the theory is if you are exposed to light at night on average you will produce less melatonin increasing your cancer risk
6120828 theres absolutely no reason it should be limited to breast cancer and it wouldnt necessarily be restricted to people who work night shifts people with disrupted sleep or people who are up late at night or get up frequently in the night could potentially have the same sort of effect
6120829 the modern equivalence to that situation today may unfortunately be often just a few steps to the refrigerator next door
6120830 the research in this area is really just in its infancy
6120831 this is really just the tip of the iceberg that has just begun to emerge
6120832 when you are defending 142 you try to stop runs and pick up wickets we tried different things and picked up wickets when we needed them
6120833 we were just one wicket away from making inroads into their tail but the partnership between dhoni and badrinath took the game away from us
6120834 the 60 runs they put together was the difference they batted really well in a situation like that you cant do too many things you have to stop the runs and attack as well but it didnt work for us today
6120835 that was our target anything above would have been a great score
6120836 we had to make sure we didnt lose too many wickets upfront keep wickets in hand and drag the game as much as possible
6120837 at the start of the series i said batting was the most important thing for us weve got to put runs on the board
6120838 we have good bowlers who can create opportunities but to do that we need to be consistent with the bat on a wicket like this you have to really struggle for your runs and work hard but we didnt dig in deep and fight really hard
6120839 the wickets are very fresh here because you dont play that much cricket throughout the year
6120840 whenever we play an international game the pitches always have something in it for the bowlers you cant complain its a good challenge for the cricketers theres no point playing on really flat tracks and scoring 300 runs we need to play on these kinds of wickets its just that it does a little bit with the new ball and then settles in once you get in its a very good wicket to bat on the ball comes nicely onto the bat and its got a bit of bounce
6120841 after the first game he had a tight hamstring so we gave him a day off on tuesday we wanted to have a fitness test today morning but he still had the stiffness so we didnt risk playing him in back to back games we have the champions trophy coming up and we didnt want him to pick up a serious injury
6120842 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
6120843 its nearly two weeks since we tragically lost our son paul and we cannot put into words just how much we will miss him and how much losing him has left us with a void we will never be able to fill
6120844 from an early age paul was inquisitive and had a thirst for knowledge and the desire to learn more with the ability to take on information like a sponge
6120845 paul loved cooking and could often be found attempting to create a variety of dishes but always had a reluctance to wash the pots afterwards
6120846 i have to check what time our flight leaves and i need to make sure i got a confirmation for our hotel in seattle its fine honey ill be a half an hour tops i just want to make sure everything is perfect for the second leg of our honeymoon
6120847 that awesome girl who likes sports youre so much cooler than those other women who dont get it
6120848 clubs like liverpool are always looking round the world for players and there is always going to be someone new challenging you
6120849 it was sudden one day i was a liverpool player the next i was going to leave
6120850 i just wanted to make sure i got the best possible club there was no way i was going to be comfortable playing for another english club and i had plenty of offers from other clubs in the premier league
6120851 i didnt have to leave because i had another year left but i did want to be playing regularly and i didnt feel that would happen this season if i stayed
6120852 im only 21 and i know that i still have a lot to learn
6120853 i hope this season will be very good for me
6120854 im very pleased with his response to not being in the team and we have to remember that he has come back from his injury two months earlier than expected
6120855 i think the gaffers searching around to try and find the right one that can come in here and whos got the right character im sure that before the window closes the manager will have that guy in and then its up to the four of us to battle it out to get in the game
6120856 i think i definitely need one the type of player i am the size i am
6120857 we were visiting my eldest son in france when a friend phoned to tell me about the attack
6120858 i couldnt believe it i was in shock the holiday was ruined because all we could think about was why us
6120859 i want to believe it was an isolated incident but you dont know whats going to happen next
6120860 we came to ireland three years ago for better pay and living conditions and have made many friends we work hard and are very friendly so i cannot understand why we were targeted
6120861 i havent slept properly since the attack every time i hear a noise out the back i think that its going to happen again its very frightening
6120862 we have very good neighbours and they have been very supportive
6120863 maybe this attack was just carried out by young boys who are bored and had nothing else to do i dont know but hopefully it will not happen again
6120864 such outstanding results can only be achieved through partnership and cooperation which have been at the centre of life in sacred heart ever since the opening of the school in 1930
6120865 over 10 per cent of students achieved straight a results in three subjects
6120866 over 80 per cent of our students achieved an ato c pass it is a wonderful achievement for them
6120867 teaching staff at newry high an all ability school work exceptionally hard to give students every support and opportunity to succeed
6120868 ensuring students would have the widest possible choice of options at third level and beyond
6120869 i firmly believe they result from the hard work enthusiasm and dedication of our young people

6120873 we thought that helping raise money for an air ambulance would be a fitting tribute to gerald and those people from the emergency services that arrived on the scene of the crash
6120874 hopefully an air ambulance will help save many lives especially in the light of cuts in ambulance services
6120875 its currently working well in england and wales where they have 17 air ambulances its early days but were hopeful we can make a good contribution to the campaign
6120876 i think it will get a positive reaction and also help publicise the campaign and hopefully other people will start their fundraising towards getting an air ambulance for the area
6120877 the community in dromintee along with geralds family and friends came together in an effort to bring something positive out of this heartbreaking incident
6120878 we felt that the greatest tribute to the memory of gerald would be to try and prevent further deaths on the road or to help those who have been in an accident
6120879 the chinese government has reportedly detained 35 pakistanis visiting china to watch olympics after they were suspected of planning to attack proceedings of the games
6120880 to see such an appalling act happen to this memorial is beyond condemnation
6120881 the cowards that did this realise that the 10 h block hunger strikers hold such admiration and respect among republicans because of the sacrifice that they made and the circumstances in which they gave their lives
6120882 many people feel that this is a direct result of tensions stirred up within unionism by its leaders using the names and memories of the h block martyrs to do so
6120883 i would call on unionist leaders and politicians especially those involved in the recent attack on raymond mccreesh park to condemn this recent vandalism
6120884 i have no doubt that the republican community here will rise to the occasion and restore this monument to its original state
6120885 i would call on people not to be lured into a situation where they feel they must respond to this act that is not to the benefit of republicans
6120886 whilst i do not agree with the often illegal erection of monuments and memorials to republican terrorists and or internees nor the associated glorification and glamorisation of these individuals i do not think that daubing paint or graffiti on such memorials is an appropriate way to vent opposition
6120887 there is a way for the travellers to get on the register but that invloves providing original documents for evidence of residence and date of birth
6120888 however some travellers dont have evidence for a place of residence as they may not have a permanent address
6120889 they may not have a medical card as some of them may not even have been registered at birth
6120890 its illegal not to have your name on the electoral register but they are not making it easy for the travellers to get on it
6120891 i had six or seven letters a bank statement a hospital letter my driving licence
6120892 i am a registered care assistant and i had a letter about that but still that wasnt enough
6120893 they even told me that my driving licence is only valid if it had been issued in the last six months but ive had it almost 10 years
6120894 i like it actually it has a certain je ne se qua
6120895 you think a pile of rubbish on your kitchen floor is good

6120900 i was actually born in columbus ms and we lived there until i was four this is my first year at lincoln fl i played for thomas county central ga the last two years
6120901 they pass the ball a whole lot more here in georgia all you do is run run and run some more when in doubt i have learned a lot more techniques since i have been at lincoln i feel like my overall skills as a lineman are more complete in every aspect of the game
6120902 i hold two world records in the dead lift and bench press for the 15 and under group i benched 405 pounds in a state meet as a 15 year old and i dead lifted 540
6120903 i am definitely getting the most mail from duke ball state and east carolina which are the three schools who have offered me as far as the other schools i would have to say georgia tech florida fsu and some of the big 10 schools those are the main ones and ole miss too their recruiting coordinator and i talked a lot in the spring i think they are real close to offering me i have also talked many times with the lsu coaches they talk about their upcoming season and how they won the national championship last year
6120904 i like florida state and georgia i have always kind of been a fan of them growing up i also like duke a lot because of their academics
6120905 florida state florida and georgia tech tech is probably the closest to offering me next they talk to my coaches a lot and they tell me that they are really interested

6120914 a cursory review of the events that caused an intensification of hostile relations between the major actors involved in the abkhaz conflict is presented prior to their analysis the key events in this development have been the declaration of independence by kosovo on february 17 2008 and its international ramifications russias decision to suspend sanctions against the abkhaz republic imposed by the commonwealth of independent states cis and the establishment of formal relations between russia and the abkhaz republic reinforcements of the formally cis peacekeeping mission in abkhazia and escalation of the military tension between the abkhaz republic and georgia russia declared not to abide by the sanctions imposed on sukhumi in 1996 by cis heads of state which forbid economic and military cooperation and establishment of formal relations with the de facto government on march 6 following the russias presidential election in which dmitri medvedev received ca 90 of votes by participating citizens of the separatist republics with russian passports the decision which to great extent represented only a formal confirmation of the status quo paralleled and possibly halted tbilisis overtures to ease the trade blockade of abkhazia the next day both de facto governments in abkhazia and south ossetia pleaded to the russian duma to recognize their independence in view of the kosovo precedent

6120924 earlier in the week they had all gone out to a restaurant and mark wasnt feeling well and hed had a turn which had left him confused so it had been decided to keep him in the apartment for a while to let it pass
6120925 we got one sighting of him prior to his disappearance on friday night where he was seen along the harbour near to where he was staying he was described as being in a confused state and wasnt making any sense we havent had any sightings since
6120926 were very concerned because we feel that someone should have seen something in the last few days he has his medical condition and with the heat over here at the moment maybe hes collapsed but weve checked all the medical centres and hospitals and there are no reports of him being admitted
6120927 we dont know what his state of mind is at the moment or where he is

6120933 there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular for us people are people you should all have your own opinion we are hopefully putting the human element in what is an unfortunate part of life there are people over there dealing with situations like this and were showing the human part of being there its the forgiveness part that is key
6120934 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness

6120937 when im in the windup im fine but when im in the stretch i go to my balance point i pick my leg up and im already going forward its not allowing me to get the ball out of my glove and really be on top
6120938 we did one side by side where i waited back and threw a pitch and one where i didnt wait back in one frame you can see the difference where my upper body is at and where my lower body is at the right way and in the other one its all out of whack fastballs when i stay back and let myself to get on top of it its for the most part where i want to throw it and when i dont thats when the ball tails back over the middle
6120939 if we start looking at each other as human beings that can be the foundation for creating the programs and social structure that will help people get out of homelessness
6120940 i went to school to play soccer im passionate about it and i transitioned all that energy in my life about soccer into the world cup
6120941 typically in homeless services someone is out of sight out of mind they are easily forgotten they get a little bit not homeless they find minimal and often temporary housing then we typically homeless aid agencies focus on the next guy because we street soccer usa build relationships with people once they get off the street we follow up that relationship they stay involved and hopefully it keeps them off the street longer and permanently
6120942 homelessness is a social issue and we all have a responsibility for it and so
6120943 because of drought climate change environmental degradation and lack of vegetation the wind is extremely strong and dusty this time unprecedented in several decades
6120944 usually these winds damage 2 3cm of topsoil but this year preliminary assessments indicate that damage has been caused up to 12cm down
6120945 the wind has also moved piles of sand onto agricultural land damaging its fertility

6120952 the reverberations from this action extend beyond these two rivers across the west

6120957 i still cant believe that they are dead i never found their bodies
6120958 i am glad when i see these messages i can only imagine how their families must feel when they learn that their loved ones are safe
6120959 if they were still alive im sure they would have come back by now im sure they are dead

6120972 shevchenko in the rossoneri shirt there really isnt much more to be done
6120973 we are close to the end of the deal and i hope that these little things that have to be fulfilled are done as soon as possible

6120980 im really bummed because i love tori and i was psyched tori was going to be on the show
6120981 defensively we still have to improve but thats normal when you only have one day of preparation
6120982 not at all you have the organisation that was not good yet but we had one training session we have 10 days to work before the uzbekistan match and thats what we have to improve definitely
6120983 the movement was excellent and overall some of the boys look really sharp
6120984 the way we try to play when weve got the ball means if we lose it were quite spread out and we have to get back into position as quickly as possible or we leave ourselves vulnerable
6120985 were a team deep enough that if a harrys missing or a timmys missing or a duke is missing weve got people who can fill in
6120986 im just looking forward to taking this step by step and doing these games and then we can see afterwards where things lie
6120987 i have been away for a very long time so the excitement and profile of where the game is at is very different for me

6120992 overall people have been calling and saying john mccain did an outstanding job
6120993 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president
6120994 mccain was so incredibly decisive and he was so clear in his answers there was no gray area
6120995 they feel like this is the start of john mccains coming out in terms of embracing the conservative evangelicals
6120996 i think they needed to hear it and they needed to hear it when the question was asked in that way that protections need to come at the moment of conception
6120997 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6120998 most people they dont do this for a living they dont study a candidates record and even when they see a record it has to be backed up by the candidate talking about it and making it important
6120999 people were before just kind of wringing their hands thinking what kind of mess do we have here what kind of choice do we have
6121000 i think he stopped the ambivalence that was out there toward john mccain
6121001 when they see mccains actual position and him talking about it it makes a difference instead of looking at roll call tallies
6121002 this became clearly no longer that this is the best of the two choices and moved from that over to this is a great great candidate that we need to get behind
6121003 either he had a heartfelt conversion on saturday or this is more manipulative electioneering
6121004 what saturday night provided was the closest view of the contrast between the two candidates that weve seen
6121005 when you have eight nine ten eleven twelve candidates running it takes people a while to get enthused
6121006 when you have a choice between someone you agree with on 80 percent of issues and someone who agreed with you on zero the choice becomes crystal clear
6121007 i think he will come a lot closer to sealing the deal if he picks a pro life running mate
6121008 yesterday senator obama got a little testy on this issue he said that i am questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6121009 senator obama has made it clear that he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq even today with victory in sight over and over again he has advocated unconditional withdrawal regardless of the facts on the ground
6121010 he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt seem to understand the consequences of an american defeat in iraq how it would risk a wider war and threaten the security of american families
6121011 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6121012 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6121013 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6121014 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6121015 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 1
6121016 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6121017 not only did the clinton campaign give mccain and his advisers a road map but they actually started the mccains down that path
6121018 thats why youre hearing from obama very specific policy oriented proposals here
6121019 theres not a lot of that kind of flash if you will from the earlier days
6121020 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6121021 what the clinton campaign demonstrated is when you bring obama back down to earth its a better battle

6121026 i love the 200 it is closer to my heart
6121027 the 100 is a product of me not wanting to run the 400 metres and yes i am good at it
6121028 i cant say i expected him to go so fast and to separate from the field so much it was the most impressive athletics feat ive seen in my life
6121029 the fact he can run even faster is amazing it was an incredible performance
6121030 were still hopeful whether surgery is required or not that it will be a one to two week injury
6121031 depending on the medical outcome of course unless something unexpected emerges we are thinking he will be able to play in the last game and if not then the first final if we get there
6121032 hes back running and were certainly planning for a return in round 22
6121033 thats been the most physically and mentally draining that ive played in
6121034 its shattering really i know weve finished with the bronze and i guess you have to be proud of that but this team has played so well over the last couple of games and to finish it like that is extremely disappointing
6121035 if that doesnt get us back into the olympics then i dont know what will
6121036 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
6121037 i am looking forward to playing again in january in my home country and using that as a springboard to compete at my best again on the world stage for at least a couple of more years
6121038 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win
6121039 my first priority is to win every davis cup tie and if lleyton was fit he would obviously be there
6121040 but it is going to be a potential step up for someone it is something that has been coming for a while
6121041 who knows what could happen and how they will react some react very positively and some struggle but you dont know until you test them
6121042 the most important thing at the moment is for australia to bring along their best young players
6121043 bernard and carsten and brydan are great young players and it is a terrific thing that one or two of them could get a chance as harry hopman used to blood young players in davis cup
6121044 in the days of hopman he used to bring along players of potential and give them a chance to play at the earliest opportunity
6121045 they are more likely to create an impact and do great things than more senior players because they are not battle scarred by a series of losses
6121046 were excited to once again merge fan fervor with at amp ts best in class technology
6121047 by teaming up with the first outside lands festival were able to give music lovers the exclusive content they want whenever and however they want to view it over the tv pc or wireless device
6121048 through the blue room we are able to share the sights and sounds of outside lands with even more music fans across the country extending the festival into a nationwide event and creating a platform for at amp t to introduce our products and services to consumers
6121049 i felt good actually believe it or not for 10 and a half laps 11 laps and it was my turn to go with 500m left but the qatari beat me to it
6121050 i thought this is good i will just follow him but after 50 or 60 metres of that i couldnt go any more i dont know why i just wasnt good enough
6121051 all the heats were just as hard as the other you didnt have to run that fast to get through on times but i backed my ability to finish in the top four and it bit me on the arse
6121052 i think i can go into the race and get medals every time but it wasnt meant to be
6121053 i dont know why i have got no excuses it just didnt happen
6121054 semi finals are designed to get rid of the weaker runners and obviously tonight i wasnt going to get a medal anyway off that performance if i made the final
6121055 theres so many players that for different reasons dont get the opportunities that could potentially open up for them with that new legislation from australian rugby
6121056 the relaxation of being able to look at some other players certainly gives you that option of bringing in maybe some seniority which ushers through the junior guys in your program if they are not already set to go
6121057 im not physically looking myself at the moment but ive had a brief chat with chris webb waratahs manager and chris hickey head coach about south africa as a possibility
6121058 what weve done is discussed some of the agents that ive got to know internationally that they could work through
6121059 its one of those things that due diligence says youve got to look because you are looking at your whole program
6121060 if we werent thinking that way we wouldnt be doing the right thing if there is an opportunity to build the program as strong as you can make it thats what youve got to do
6121061 losing vickerman elsom and lyons is a really big hole in that waratah forward pack let alone the waratah team
6121062 what was going on behind the scenes im not exactly sure but i could imagine being a player in that and it wouldnt have been easy
6121063 if you look at what the springboks did in the last game they took on new zealand who have been the most consistent scrum in the world in the last three years and they had them under severe pressure from the very first scrum of the game and they delivered 100 per cent scrum ball
6121064 the contest is to get as many votes as we can to not support the two major candidates
6121065 the day before i left home for christmas i started walking my precinct
6121066 it was icy i fell down three times i had bruises all over my legs but i kept going because i believe in his message
6121067 i believe in what he has to offer america as a young person i wasnt just going to sit back and watch it all go by
6121068 but if he puts huckabee on the ticket he gets my money and he gets my physical labor
6121069 if youre willing to laugh at a candidate onstage thats a really deep personal affront
6121070 thats what really made me say im going to open up my wallet and im going to give to this guy because no one laughs at money
6121071 nach uns die sintflut ist der wahlspruch jedes kapitalisten und jeder kapitalistennation
6121072 the poor single mother thing is getting a bit lame now we are over that
6121073 we would always have fund raisers at her school and fund raisers at work we would have morning teas all of my department would make things and then we would force the rest of the company into buying it
6121074 a lot of people have helped us along the way
6121075 she paid for me to go and watch sally and she got a gold medal which was fantastic i would never have gone unless somebody had paid for it
6121076 i did have two jobs my full time job which i do now and then i took a second job on saturdays and sundays for a year in the lead up to commonwealth games because she needed massage and physio to maintain her body
6121077 that was 100 or 120 a week and that is why i got the extra job i was doing call centre work on the weekend it wasnt hard but i had to work every day
6121078 sally doesnt come from a broken home it is just me and her i am a single parent always have been
6121079 the race was run on a downhill track but i still came last
6121080 sal this is it no guts no glory you just have to go for it

6121251 this will include tax cuts and measures to stabilize domestic capital markets and support healthy development of the housing market
6121252 chinas economy is suffering from unstable global factors increasing challenges and hardships
6121253 chinas top priorities for macroeconomic control in the second half are maintaining stable but rapid economic growth and controlling inflation this is proof that the government has become more cautious on macroeconomic controls and monetary policy wont be so tight in the future
6121254 place a higher priority on containing price rises and curbing inflation and implement a tight monetary policy
6121255 make its top macroeconomic priorities maintaining stable and relatively fast economic growth
6121256 external demand will continue to weaken and the negative impact on exports economic growth and employment will emerge further

6121259 said one of fannie maes achievements in 2006 was expanding its involvement in the market for subprime and other nontraditional mortgages
6121260 internal documents show that even late in the housing bubble fannie mae was drawn to risky loans by a variety of temptations including the desire to increase its market share and fulfill government quotas for the support of low income borrowers
6121261 fannie mae documents from the period obtained by the washington post paint a picture of a company with the dual incentives of fostering affordable housing and making money and of one caught between the imperatives of increasing its market share while avoiding excessive risk
6121262 fannie mae aimed to benefit from subprime loans and expand the market for them and hoped to pass much of the risk on to others documents show along with subprime loans which were typically issued to borrowers with blemished credit the company targeted so called alt a loans which were often made with no verification of the borrowers income
6121263 yeah i havent lived in the u s since i was 6 years old and ive only studied in french so im considered as a foreigner
6121264 were not going to say that if nycha was funded properly this would have been prevented what we will say is that the federal government has not lived up to its promise to fund public housing
6121265 it might have and it might not have because these are machines and machines often break down theyre fallible
6121266 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
6121267 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
6121268 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
6121269 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs hardball echoing comments he made earlier in the day at an event promoting his book at the national press club
6121270 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
6121271 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
6121272 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6121273 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
6121274 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
6121275 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
6121276 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
6121277 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
6121278 sen obama said he would do everything possible to end the war in iraq and emphasized the need for a political solution yet he failed to show up to vote for sen bidens critical amendment to provide a political solution in iraq
6121279 frankly i think im more qualified than other candidates and the issues facing the american public are all in my wheelbarrow
6121280 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
6121281 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
6121282 well the point is it turned out they didnt but everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them he catalogued they catalogued them this was not some some cheney you know pipe dream this was in fact catalogued
6121283 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
6121284 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
6121285 the threat saddam hussein presented was that if saddam was left unfettered which i said during that period for the next five years with sanctions lifted and billions of dollars into his coffers then i believed he had the ability to acquire a tactical nuclear weapon not by building it by purchasing it
6121286 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
6121287 i mean the truth of the matter is that that the americas this administrations policy and the surge are a failure and that the surge which was supposed to stop sectarian violence and long enough to give political reconciliation theres been no political reconciliation the reality is that although there has been some mild progress on the security front there is in fact no no real security in baghdad and or in anbar province where i was dealing with the most serious problem sectarian violence sectarian violence is as strong and as solid and as serious a problem as it was before the surge started
6121288 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
6121289 if he surges another 20 30 or whatever number hes going to into baghdad itll be a tragic mistake in my view but as a practical matter theres no way to say mr
6121290 unless we fundamentally change the rotation dates and fundamentally change how many members of the national guard were calling up itll be virtually impossible to maintain 150 000 folks this year
6121291 have you ever met an editor who wasnt busy and just had time to read penpal letters all day
6121292 i used to belong to a writers organization but they didnt understand me and were jealous of my talent
6121293 i previously sent this manuscript to this other publishing house and they didnt buy it so theyre obviously short sighted morons
6121294 i am contacting you in regards to my novel moby dick which i spoke to you about at rwa nationals this past july in san francisco
6121295 i have previously submitted to you my novel typee which you declined but at the time you expressed interest in seeing another work in the future so i would be glad to send the moby dick manuscript at your earliest convenience
6121296 oh right typee i remember that it was good but we had just purchased another vaguely homoerotic sailing story and we couldnt fit two in the lineup yeah ill take a look at that

6121299 der heutige parlamentarismus repr sentative demokratie ist nach der klassischen verfassungssystematik keine demokratie direkte demokratie sondern je nach wertung eine aristokratie oder eine oligarchie im urspr nglichen nicht auf dem vorrang der besseren herkunft beruhenden sinn
6121300 nach uns die sintflut ist der wahlspruch jedes kapitalisten und jeder kapitalistennation
6121301 inflation is way too hot and with housing way too cold we have the opposite of a goldilocks economy
6121302 todays ppi is a bit of an echo and maybe a little bit of a rude reminder of how much of a problem inflation was in july
6121303 it can be seen as a payback in june from the building code change in new york city we may see another decline in august
6121304 the underlying trend is still downward the fundamentals in housing are still poor
6121305 we all know what mr volcker did in 1980 1981 when inflation got out of control he nuked the economy by driving the funds rate to 20
6121306 no one expects that to happen now especially with commodity prices having come down quite sharply from their july highs

6121308 this is a known iphone bug that is being fixed in the next software update in september
6121309 many report the iphone 2 0 firmware suddenly failing to load non default apps regardless of their nature briefly loading them before abruptly jumping back to the home screen
6121310 ik heb het gevoel dat ik de afgelopen tijd in een achtbaan zat
6121311 heen en weer geschud en verscheurd voelde ik me maar ik ben er wel zelf ingestapt door een persbericht uit te geven dat bij mensen de indruk wekte dat ik nu nog steeds achter die actie sta terwijl mijn boek nu juist het tegendeel beschrijft ik had geen grip meer op wat er gebeurde door mijn kamerlidmaatschap op te geven heb ik het gevoel dat ik mijn autonomie heb teruggekregen
6121312 we hebben een sterke maatschappelijke beweging nodig om de milieumaatregelen die nodig zijn erdoor te krijgen voor mij is het zo duidelijk dat ik doorga met die maatschappelijke beweging ik heb mijn boek ik ga daarover discussi ren ik val helemaal niet in een zwart gat
6121313 dat is de verandering die ik heb doorgemaakt als links mag inbreken dan mag rechts dat ook dan beland je in een wildwest samenleving
6121314 ik ben de waarde gaan zien van het parlement en van de rechterlijke macht als instrumenten van maatschappelijke ordening uit de reacties van de afgelopen dagen blijkt dat veel mensen nog steeds denken zoals in de jaren tachtig zij staan nog steeds achter de actiegroep rara nou daar heb ik altijd afstand van genomen
6121315 ik heb de heftigheid van de reacties van de afgelopen twee weken niet verwacht ik wil in mijn boek verantwoording afleggen maar het lijkt wel op een afrekening dat emoties en gevoelens nog zo scherp zouden liggen had ik niet verwacht dat heb ik onderschat
6121316 daar moeten belangrijke besluiten worden genomen die een vervolg zijn op eerdere klimaatbijeenkomsten als kyoto en bali
6121317 in eigen land moet groenlinks een grotere partij worden bij volgende verkiezingen mogen we niet weer de kans laten lopen in een kabinet te gaan zitten zonder groene ministers komen er geen goede milieumaatregelen de tijd is echt gekomen om die zaken nu te regelen
6121318 als je ziet dat de pvda steeds het mileu laat vallen als het er om spant in de coalitie dat een goede jongen als diederik samsom en minister cramer van milieu vanuit hun eigen partij te weinig steun krijgen om hun milieustandpunten erdoor te krijgen dan zie je hoe belangrijk dat is

6121321 these people need a new ouija board all these big smart guys forecast there would be an increase of 800 000 barrels its an increase of crude oil of 9 4 million barrels
6121322 my guess is that there is till some suspicion that with at least a partial relationship with u s financials canadian banks are going to have to show some kind of stress some kind of writedown on some of their assets which they havent done so far
6121323 to stop placing the burden of inflation on the lowest paid workers by making the necessary funds available

6121334 it is important to withdraw this monetary policy stimulus in a timely way
6121335 that may require us to withdraw before we are certain all of the weakness is behind us and before we are completely certain that financial markets are as tranquil as we would like to see

6121349 for almost two thirds of todays retirees social security is their majority source of income and for millions over 65 health insurance would not be affordable without medicare yet all too often pre retirees know less about their social security and medicare benefits than any other piece of their retirement plan its critical that baby boomers do their homework

6121366 a republican state house candidate who said his expunged dui records are being used against him in his campaign to unseat a longtime democratic incumbent is joining leaders from both political parties in calling for an outside investigation into allegations of unauthorized background checks performed by a tennessee highway patrolman however a thp spokesperson said a list of those whose backgrounds were allegedly probed by lt ronnie shirley would not be made public anytime soon but instead turned over to the district attorney once an internal investigation is complete tennessee department of safety officials announced tuesday shirley was put on administrative leave and that the thp would continue its internal investigation gop lebanon businessman a j mccall is challenging state rep stratton bone for the 46th district house seat a race observers on both sides of the political aisle say is likely a close race
6121367 political observers say it is a classic attempt at political intimidation aimed at convincing the candidate not to run he is running against an entrenched democrat incumbent and if he wins it is very likely the gop would take control of the state house for the first time in history

6121375 its been so amazing and ive loved most of it but i think there is going to come a time where i need to live my life for myself and not in front of viewers im young and having fun with it now but its not something i am going to be able to do forever obviously
6121376 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
6121377 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
6121378 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
6121379 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs hardball echoing comments he made earlier in the day at an event promoting his book at the national press club
6121380 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
6121381 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
6121382 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6121383 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
6121384 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
6121385 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
6121386 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
6121387 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
6121388 sen obama said he would do everything possible to end the war in iraq and emphasized the need for a political solution yet he failed to show up to vote for sen bidens critical amendment to provide a political solution in iraq
6121389 frankly i think im more qualified than other candidates and the issues facing the american public are all in my wheelbarrow
6121390 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
6121391 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
6121392 well the point is it turned out they didnt but everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them he catalogued they catalogued them this was not some some cheney you know pipe dream this was in fact catalogued
6121393 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
6121394 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
6121395 the threat saddam hussein presented was that if saddam was left unfettered which i said during that period for the next five years with sanctions lifted and billions of dollars into his coffers then i believed he had the ability to acquire a tactical nuclear weapon not by building it by purchasing it
6121396 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
6121397 i mean the truth of the matter is that that the americas this administrations policy and the surge are a failure and that the surge which was supposed to stop sectarian violence and long enough to give political reconciliation theres been no political reconciliation the reality is that although there has been some mild progress on the security front there is in fact no no real security in baghdad and or in anbar province where i was dealing with the most serious problem sectarian violence sectarian violence is as strong and as solid and as serious a problem as it was before the surge started
6121398 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
6121399 if he surges another 20 30 or whatever number hes going to into baghdad itll be a tragic mistake in my view but as a practical matter theres no way to say mr
6121400 unless we fundamentally change the rotation dates and fundamentally change how many members of the national guard were calling up itll be virtually impossible to maintain 150 000 folks this year

6121452 the emphasis will go from patients and employers right to the shareholders
6121453 right to the free exercise of religion does not exempt defendant physicians here from conforming their conduct to the anti discrimination requirements
6121454 i am not so certain this balance of competing interests would product the same result in the case of a sole practitioner
6121455 clear and emphatic that discrimination has no place in doctors offices
6121456 because it addresses a common misperception that many health care practitioners do seem to believe that there is a religious freedom to pick and choose among patients notwithstanding a law requiring that all patients be treated equally
6121457 desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about

6121466 o reconhecimento dos rostos obtido sem esfor o por pessoas de todas as culturas diferentes e por isso era considerado como um mecanismo universal entre os humanos

6121469 a estrat gia empregada para extrair informa o visual dos rostos difere com as culturas
6121470 em uma s rie de estudos do movimento dos olhos mostramos que a experi ncia social tem um impacto sobre a forma como as pessoas olham os rostos
6121471 descobrimos que os ocidentais tendem a olhar tra os espec ficos no rosto de um indiv duo tais como os olhos ou a boca enquanto que os observadores do leste da sia tendem a se focar no nariz ou no centro da face o que d uma vis o mais geral de todos os tra os

6121489 the acquisition is of strategic interest to us it will give kirloskar electric complementary engineering skills a unique footprint in europe and an important customer base built over the last few decades
6121490 the ldw team looks forward to becoming a part of the kirloskar electric family we think that kec is a perfect fit for our future growth in europe and worldwide especially in the emerging markets
6121491 kec will benefit from ldws technology and ongoing research work with german universities kec will be able to sell ldws products under the aeg brand name in the indian subcontinent and asean countries and address the market for high voltage electrical machines over 50 megawatts
6121492 kirloskar electric would distribute ldw products in india and south east asia and would leverage on ldws presence in europe to sell its products in that market the synergies generated out of this acquisition will have a multiplier effect on the competitiveness of both companies

6121599 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his

6121710 i was so impressed by the work done on this video that i wanted to find out more about
6121711 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6121712 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6121713 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6121714 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6121715 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6121716 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6121717 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6121718 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6121719 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6121720 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6121721 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6121722 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6121723 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6121724 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6121725 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6121726 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6121727 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6121728 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6121729 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6121730 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6121731 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6121732 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6121733 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6121734 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6121735 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6121736 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6121737 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6121738 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6121739 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6121740 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6121741 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6121742 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6121743 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6121744 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6121745 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6121746 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6121747 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6121748 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6121749 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6121750 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6121751 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6121752 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6121753 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6121754 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6121755 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6121756 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6121757 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6121758 who are open to doing something on the production side
6121759 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6121760 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6121761 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6121762 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6121763 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6121764 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6121765 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6121766 spanair regrets to confirm that 164 passengers and 9 crew were on board its flight jk5022 which was involved in an accident in madrid today
6121767 the accident occurred at 14 45 local time during take off aircraft type md 82
6121768 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6121769 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6121770 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6121771 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6121772 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6121773 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6121774 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6121775 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6121776 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6121777 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6121778 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6121779 what will the mother do in the middle of the night when she has a sick child and doesnt know what to do
6121780 many of the nurses that have manned the phones have done so because of injuries or age that has made it impossible for them to do regular floor nursing anymore
6121781 so they arent just losing their jobs they are probably permanently losing their livelihoods
6121782 this is a program that refers patients to physicians regardless of whether that doctor is a centura doctor we refer to hospitals other than centura hospitals we really have taken it on as a community service and its part of the community benefits that centura offers and we constantly have to evaluate services a couple values impact sessions were held and we determined the cost was becoming too much to bear it was a very difficult decision to make
6121783 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6121784 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6121785 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6121786 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6121787 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

6121790 we want to do a really cool cover version of a song that everybody loves
6121791 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6121792 now we are talking and he seems to be in a great mood laughing and enjoy ing chatting with our negotiators
6121793 its kind of breaking the ice first before asking him to change his mind
6121794 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6121795 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6121796 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6121797 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6121798 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6121799 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6121800 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6121801 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6121802 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6121803 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6121804 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6121805 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

6121807 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

6121829 effort is no guarantee of success a republican team roared into washington in 1994 with an ambitious reform agenda but became mired in the bogs of washington yet this is not necessarily cause for pessimism americas political system has a built in propensity for inertia and thats to the good it slows positive change but it also slows negative trends the founders enshrined checks and balances into the constitution to ensure that we would look carefully before rushing into new areas
6121830 the language of the americans with disabilities act is both vague and extremely complicated causing huge headaches for employers landlords and public accommodations todays new york times brings word that the justice department is demanding that apartment buildings in new york city constructed since 1991 be redesigned at enormous expense to accommodate small numbers of disabled people the irony is that the building owners already spent hundreds of millions of dollars to ensure compliance with new york citys own disabilities discrimination law local law 58 which was viewed by many as being more exacting than the ada now 100 000 apartments may need to be redesigned in new york city alone

6121875 one thing that i think is very important for us to do on all these issues is to lead by example thats why i think its so important for us to have religious tolerance here in the united states thats why its so important for us when we are criticizing other countries about rule of law to make sure that were abiding by rule of law and habeas corpus and were not engaging in torture because that gives us a moral standing to talk about these other issues

6121898 terrible tuesday inflation surges stocks dive and consumer confidence nears a record low
6121899 u s overall consumer confidence rose last week according to an
6121900 the governments latest report on inflation sent a powerful signal that the beleaguered american consumer may not have faced the worst of it yet
6121901 consumer confidence is just two points from a record low
6121902 a real blow to retailers who are hoping for strong back to school sales this year
6121903 according to the survey 11 of respondents expressed confidence in the economy up from 10 the week before also 47 of those polled said their own finances were in good standing unchanged from the prior week in assessing the buying climate 19 of respondents said it was good up from 18 a week earlier
6121904 economists say the cure for this kind of pervasive price inflation is a bitter pill which is if more americans were to lose their jobs and have even less to spend prices would probably come down
6121905 the solution from the point of view of the u s economy comes from weaker domestic demand and weaker hiring and obviously thats a very painful process

6121917 a hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor and today that new world is struggling to be born a world quite different from the one weve known a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle a world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice a world where the strong respect the rights of the weak

6121944 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head as i was now able to touch it i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section
6121945 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6121946 the motives behind this fraud are still unknown at this time it is still unclear why whitton who being a police officer for the clayton county police department in georgia got up before the world and lied and was complicit in a scheme to defraud in a felonious manner

6121951 its crucial to the public understanding of what happened it helps give the public a sense of place
6121952 thats difficult to do when your surrounding context is changing so rapidly
6121953 the view shed concept is extending itself beyond the battlefield thats worrisome
6121954 the park service is getting into land use and development beyond its geographic responsibility
6121955 we have to make sure whatever development happens along the i 66 corridor is not seen in order to protect the integrity of the battlefield
6121956 this is the sort of fate we want to ward out in other parts of the park
6121957 the study is not a way of stopping or controlling development but dealing with issues before they arise we dont have the authority to require anyone to do anything outside our boundary
6121958 you dont have to rip down trees to provide a decent view of critical events
6121959 what we have is a compromise its not a complete restoration we know we cant take it back to the way it was during the civil war
6121960 it presents a conflict between managing natural and historic resources

6121965 when colorado voters were deciding whether to require that 10 percent of the states electricity come from renewable fuels the states largest utility fought the proposal warning that any shift from coal and natural gas would be costly uncertain and unwise
6121966 now is a terrific time for renewables to launch i hope they get all the capital they need and all the great minds and talent but i dont want it to come at the expense of the oil and gas industry
6121967 as goes colorado so goes the west as far as this energy policy debate
6121968 the future in colorado is building wind farms in wheat fields
6121969 quite frankly its how we should have been thinking for 10 years
6121970 we ended up opposing that amendment in retrospect i wish we hadnt
6121971 it was one of those cases where the public was ahead of the politicians
6121972 its absolutely essential that the state offer us something that makes it worth our while to be green
6121973 weve reached this critical point where were seeing the deployment of these technologies accelerate
6121974 there was slow progress over the last decade and youre now seeing this tipping point
6121975 it could have been done in a different way and things wouldnt have gotten so heated
6121976 its chicken little all over again the sky is going to fall
6121977 the oil and gas companies see the writing on the wall the shift to renewables they want to make as much money as they can right now

6121981 civilian deaths coming as a result of retaliatory strikes against terrorists are acceptable
6121982 civilian deaths as a result of retaliatory armed conflict aimed at terrorists or an occupier country are justified
6121983 if they did not target civilians they were not terrorists if they did they were thats pretty simple
6121984 the death of civilians can not be justified by anything
6121985 the offensive in gaza killed some 137 people and im sure most of these were civilians
6121986 oh mr jones we have the results of your test do you want the bad news first or the very bad news

6121990 i wanted to make the perfect coney island experience something that captivates thats an immediate visceral reaction and that lingers in the memory
6121991 theres no better place than an amusement park to confront horror and things were fearful of
6121992 the fact that it took place near roller coasters and cotton candy sends an important message we here can engage in frivolity and fun at a time when in our name this is happening to people somewhere else
6121993 the idea behind this is the person is sucking in a little bit of water and a lot of air so they feel like theyre drowning the real power of the interrogator is the fear of the unknown
6121994 but i think if youre for or against this technique the conversation about this needs to start we need to recognize what it truly is which is torture
6121995 we are reaching a group of people that dont know about the subject
6121996 thats real wrong to torture someone and i wouldnt have put a dollar in if i knew
6121997 i dont think theres a need for that i dont like it
6121998 its our chance to be silly and political and educational all at the same time

6122000 sometimes the absurd is a way to shock people out of their daily routine and get them to think about things in fresh ways or get them to pay attention
6122001 the narrative of the presidential campaign appeared to be set on the issue of abortion sen
6122002 since saturday night ive seen a lot of confusion in the younger christian voting bloc because they thought they had figured this thing out
6122003 theres no absolutely right candidate for an evangelical and theres no absolutely wrong candidate theyre both right and theyre both wrong
6122004 to be perceived as authentic on this issue you need to have some grounding in it and usually that grounding is faith
6122005 essentially says that a doctor is required to provide treatment to a pre viable child or fetus
6122006 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
6122007 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together

6122009 virginia has added nearly a quarter million registered voters since the 2004 elections and about half of that growth came from increasingly democratic northern virginia
6122010 if virginia was the same state as it was four years ago or eight years ago there wouldnt be much discussion about virginia being a swing state
6122011 from our perspective the places we need to do well and frankly where we have the greatest support are the places that are growing the fastest
6122012 the obama campaign is changing the map they are not accepting the rules of the game
6122013 they are putting more voters in play obama has decided to put more cards in the deck and they are dealing themselves more kings and queens
6122014 registering voters is incredibly important but it is also about turning them out and that is something i think we do a very good job at
6122015 after eva king jones 88 was raped and killed in her small town virginia home a local man was accused and convicted now 33 years later police say newly discovered dna evidence has led to the arrest of someone else
6122016 its also a stalled undertaking and its a secret undertaking this hasnt been a process so far that we can have a lot of confidence in
6122017 nothing like this has ever been done and we have to really be careful because were dealing with peoples lives were dealing with peoples privacy
6122018 even though curtis is not here to witness that i think for his familys sake to know because they always believed in him
6122019 i was convinced 33 years ago that he was innocent
6122020 the dna analysis has led us to a new suspect but this does not exonerate moore
6122021 this was the one holding her down or holding a gun to her head while the other two had their way
6122022 even assuming best intentions you dont trust a prosecutor to decide whether you are guilty or innocent
6122023 its an adversarial system and you have to have someone looking out for your interest

6122043 this continues the weaker picture seen in june and points towards the more subdued levels of lending we are likely to see in the second half of 2008
6122044 even though the base rate has come down by 0 75 since august 2007 those without higher deposits have seen little benefit with many first time buyers effectively shut out of the market

6122053 i would have thought that the kids who were on the margins of passing that you would have seen many of them go over the top
6122054 im surprised that that kind of money that kind of incentives doesnt produce better results it sort of undercuts the argument that the problem is the question of motivation
6122055 im just dumbfounded that they can regard this as an achievement or as a great improvement or as something worth spending the money on

6122247 but youre out there in the environment up close with the wind blowing in your face on a hot summer day or the cold wind on a cold winter day
6122248 i ride a motorcycle because i enjoy the stress reduction it provides me when riding out on back roads it really enables you to see parts of the country you miss in a car being on a motorcycle requires you to be much more aware of your surroundings enabling you to notice many things on the road that we usually take for granted
6122249 my dad always spoke about that experience with a twinkle in his eye
6122250 a daredevil by nature he passed this trait onto me he was not pleased to learn of my new hobby when i first started riding i tried to remind him that i was merely following in his footsteps

6122254 look at the players we can bring off the bench im mean its crazy tamika catching seimone augustus fowles and candace parker youre kidding me so we feel like we can bring our second wave of players and third wave of players
6122255 a lot of times when the reserves come in that is when the game breaks open
6122256 its not always because the first five isnt doing a great job its because thats when the fatigue sets in for the other team
6122257 she comes in there with three or four people around her and just reaches up grabs the ball and puts it in
6122258 we talked about the depth of this team from the beginning
6122259 its like our starting five is in the playing with energy and then when subs come in it never goes away in fact it picks up
6122260 they did a very good job of picking the 12 players that they did
6122261 when you can call anybody off the bench and they come bring it in for you i think its great its up to us to utilize our depth well
6122262 we dont have to have anybody worn out by playing 25 or 30 minutes the coaches get every ounce from everybody and we are not going to overuse anybody
6122263 this team has the best chemistry of any of the teams i ever been on especially after coming together for such a short period of time
6122264 the scary thing about them is that they have players with tremendous ability their front line is something to contend with
6122265 carpet is a safe cost effective and fashionable choice for many indoor settings
6122266 i think its divisive for the support hillary campaign to continue at this time she made the decision to fully support mr obama
6122267 i dont know why theyre not taking their cue from hillary and falling in line
6122268 her supporters acting on their own because theyre proud of what they have done for her
6122269 obama could not seal the deal with voters during the primaries
6122270 the more voters got to know him the more voters chose hillary clinton
6122271 democrats must offer voters the candidate with the best chance of winning in november the experienced candidate who understands the problems we face and the solutions we need senator hillary rodham clinton
6122272 where obama once got a free pass on such despicable relationships with anti american people such as rev jeremiah wright george soros louis farrakhan the american voters are beginning to realize what a questionable and shady past this man has led
6122273 we had hoped that this kind of politics especially from within the party would have been abandoned
6122274 we have a historic moment that we need to grasp and we need to move forward as a unified party
6122275 all it will do is give the republican party a greater opportunity to fight our candidate
6122276 if she doesnt stand up and speak against it then shes for it if shes aware of it she needs to make a clear statement that this should not be done
6122277 with that cadre of mal discontents who want to have a war on the democratic floor
6122278 what is my role at the convention then if not to vote for hillary
6122279 if this is just about obama then only invite the obama delegates

6122282 pacific island countries are saying to the countries of the world including australia including the united states including the europeans including the chinese and the indians that the time for action concrete action over climate change is now
6122283 tuvalu has been crying out about the dire effects of climate change and rising sea levels but nothing concrete nothing tangible has been done to mitigate the problems that they encounter
6122284 there appears to be this concept that climate change is something that is happening out there in the future but it is impacting countries in the region now especially the small island countries
6122285 i am very heartened that the pacific island countries are making their voices heard on the subject of climate change
6122286 they have a different approach to wine beer and spirits than other generations
6122287 in this generation there is an acceptability of wine as the alcohol of choice and they drink for drinkings sake for pleasure and conviviality less in concert with foods and eating
6122288 they are drinking wine completely different than the previous generation
6122289 they are fearless they are the imac generation they click and try something new if they dont like that they click and try something else
6122290 they just want to try something taste it and if its good post it to a friend they learn from their tribe not the so called wine critics
6122291 we have found that 21 percent of people who drink wine regularly are in that age group
6122292 beverages like coffee have become a vehicle where you can travel the world jamaica colombia brazil its an adventure
6122293 wine is something that has a living soul its about history land geography people its cross cultural when its in the bottle wine changes every day and when you pour it in the glass it will have a personality its so complex wine is always presenting you with a challenge
6122294 and they said gosh were we ever any good in this sport and that just about killed me
6122295 as close to a dysfunctional family as you could find
6122296 i think they felt like they were outcasts in a way
6122297 they felt almost like usa water polo turned their back on them and thats not the case at all i feel like we had to just show that people were just there supporting them people were there that cared about it i was one of them i was going to fight for them whatever it took
6122298 a lot of great pieces a lot of great players but they were individuals and they had to start believing in each other and trusting each other
6122299 especially with him being a great captain and me being able to talk to him and learn a couple things from him
6122300 but i think the biggest thing was the players all of us being in the same situation for the last 10 years and sacrificing everything and finally coming together and saying guys weve got to do it together all of us or none all for one
6122301 since the last major tournament the world championships in 2007 where the u s finished ninth the team is not even close to what it was then every game we seem to be growing
6122302 were playing as a team now in the past i think weve maybe been relying on a couple of people and now everybodys contributing everybodys believing
6122303 in serbia even though they kicked the crap out of us early on as nine days in serbia wore on we got a little closer and a little closer
6122304 beating them and controlling them the entire game showed us hey guys we can beat anybody in the world
6122305 dont go into any game with fear and thats what we did monday
6122306 saw great defense saw some great adjustments at the plate saw the international tiebreaker a little bit of everything the sport has to offer
6122307 and it was just a tremendous effort on monicas part i thought she threw exceptionally well and gave us an opportunity to win the ballgame
6122308 any time you have tasha on second it does a lot for you
6122309 any ball i put in play shes either going to advance or hopefully score
6122310 throughout the game i was trying to make adjustments to her pitch and trying to hit what she was throwing instead of waiting for my pitch
6122311 she was coming at me hard and she was going to try to beat me with my speed and knowing with my last at bat that she had jammed me up and in i was thinking for sure she was coming inside and so just waiting for that pitch i knew she was going to bring it hard and just trying to stay early enough to get my bat on it
6122312 but we have some great batters and we just need to give it some time i tried to stay in the moment and come through with some big strikeouts i knew it was going to be a fight
6122313 all throughout the u s exhibition tour coach candrea was always stressing being prepared for the 20 inning game the 16 inning game the 14 inning game
6122314 so all throughout the tour i was able to prepare mentally and physically and emotionally for those games that were going to be longer than seven innings
6122315 thats what you prepare for the 14 inning game and then when you only throw five innings its a bonus
6122316 i think it definitely shows how good every country is
6122317 its something we see away from the olympics japan has beaten us every year we have always played close games with them
6122318 if people away from the olympics could see how this game has grown i think a game like this shows that
6122319 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6122320 obviously for the safety of everybody in the city of santa maria or wherever he is its better that he be in custody
6122321 fairly common and that santa maria has some homicides that have technically been solved but there are no suspects in custody
6122322 we dont talk about peoples interviews or what people tell us
6122323 today those involved in child exploitation like everyone else are using the remarkable reach of the internet and peer to peer technology is the latest frontier
6122324 but we have a message for child sex predators who think they can escape justice by hiding in cyberspace
6122325 we will do everything in our power and use every tool at our disposal to keep our children safe whether they are around the block or around the world
6122326 i think that its important that curriculum does move down to the district office
6122327 go over there and take a look at the bridge street facility so you can get a better feel of what were talking about
6122328 i really like doing it i like that its a program
6122329 its a job but also a program that helps people get a better work ethic and be a better worker and it helps our state
6122330 its not just working at wal mart its doing something greater
6122331 its strange because one day you could be working hard and drenched in sweat and the next day youre picking up trash with caltrans for eight hours
6122332 ive never seen even in my 15 years with the ccc a leader either male or female who is as good as precise someone with a lot of heart like caitlin
6122333 her compassion for people is what we truly look for in crew leaders and full time positions
6122334 and she fits that mold 100 times over shes a very amazing person
6122335 i just like to do stuff not knowing what im going to do
6122336 he wasnt a kid who got into trouble he was quiet and respectful
6122337 he was quiet and polite not rowdy or boisterous like most teenage boys
6122338 you cant make decisions for other people and thats what he wanted
6122339 i told him to keep his head down i feel so sorry for his family
6122340 i definitely think he felt he was doing a good thing
6122341 everyone should know jacob was a nice guy who cared about people
6122342 i think its necessary to make the transportation system viable
6122343 but what is the downside of having a state run facility
6122344 i didnt think it would be fair or politically viable
6122345 a 2 30 minute clip of the lost and forsaken the first single off of ashes and madness is now available at the section
6122346 hey keep in touch maybe ill catch you if i come back for thanksgiving
6122347 im carrying a weapon flying a multimillion dollar jet with passengers but im still screened as you know on the terrorist watch list
6122348 theres going to come a point in time where everybodys on the list
6122349 and all of a sudden he says how old is he
6122350 i want the burden of clearing this up to be on the agencies that are the holders of responsibilities the department of homeland security and the attorney general of the united states
6122351 we told the airlines we would allow them if someone gave a birth date to exclude that person from the list
6122352 let the person get their boarding pass directly at home or at the kiosk just like everyone else some airlines have done this some have chosen not to because they dont want to spend the money
6122353 and their attitude is well tsa gets the blame for it so i guess if they can do what they are doing now with food and can charge you for it but i hate to suggest that i may give them an idea
6122354 we are now awaiting tsas announced january 2009 implementation of the secure flight program which is expected to reduce the number of misidentified passengers
6122355 in the meantime the airlines worked collaboratively with tsa to further minimize unnecessary passenger inconvenience a key part of that short term solution relies on frequent flier program enrollment to help resolve misidentification issues and as a result we are urging passengers to enroll

6122361 my assistant scoutmaster john schlesselmann went to cal poly with dr chamitoff
6122362 they kept in touch and had planned for a while to do this
6122363 im hoping that maybe something like this might build the excitement in some of the kids who could be interested in helping out with space program down the road
6122364 we are looking forward to delivering a consistent crystal clear signal in the area
6122365 kclu is already providing award winning local news and public affairs coverage of santa barbara county and this new signal will make it more accessible to our listeners
6122366 i was shocked and impressed by the striking beauty of the bird
6122367 the judges spend weeks in a darkened room looking at thousands of beautiful images but the final exhibition photographs have a creativity originality and sheer drama that set them apart
6122368 the competition plays an increasingly crucial role in raising the profile of wildlife photography and generating awareness of conservation
6122369 nothing speaks louder than an evocative photograph that stirs the imagination tugs at the heart strings and engages the mind
6122370 what drives me is the opportunity of the legacy project
6122371 i think its one of the unique opportunities in the state from both a preservation and a community standpoint
6122372 where else can you have the ocean lakes mountains equestrian and open spaces surrounding you and protect nature and have a place to hang out thats minutes from state street
6122373 this is not a conservative developer thing vs a liberal no growth thing
6122374 i was thinking it would be a four or five year process
6122375 we would not be thrilled with the mou or grid because we spent a lot of money to acquire the land for the alternative because the county and the liked that direction
6122376 its the largest private easement dedication in the history of the gaviota coast
6122377 im not saying that matts alt 1b design doesnt have its benefits
6122378 is alt 1b the best thing we have out there i dont know yet but were trying to come up with some compromise here
6122379 in this particular situation the ability to impose a solution is constrained from the norm
6122380 then the question becomes can you arrive at a solution that produces as many benefits as possible
6122381 many of the chemicals released are highly toxic some may affect childrens developing reproductive systems while other can affect brain development and the nervous system
6122382 unless companies eliminate all hazardous chemicals from their electronic products and take responsibility for the entire lifecycle of their products this poisonous dumping will continue
6122383 the unit plans to integrate some of our content delivery services into a single service
6122384 we have made great progress with the initial offering this year and i see great potential going forward as we bring context aware internet services to peoples pockets

6122400 voting is the most precious right of every u s citizen and we have a moral obligation to ensure the integrity of our elections we cannot rest until we have done everything we can to make sure that voters have confidence in our voting system and exercise their right to vote we must be able to easily and accurately count every vote so that every vote counts
6122401 i am pleased to once again join with senator clinton in introducing companion legislation in the house as we continue our efforts to ensure that every american is afforded their constitutional right to vote
6122402 considering the tremendous election discrepancies that we have seen take place in this country including this past mid term election we know that we are still dealing with a flawed system the passage of this legislation is paramount to ensuring that people throughout this country are not disenfranchised when they attempt to exercise their right to vote
6122403 it was exactly 42 years ago today that hosea williams and i led a march of 600 peaceful protestors across the edmund pettus bridge in selma alabama many of them gave a little blood on that bridge for the cause of voting rights in america it is because of those brave individuals that i and so many others hold seats in congress today we have come a great distance but we still live in an america where some votes are nullified discounted and disregarded and where some communities are systematically disenfranchised from full participation in the democratic process we need this comprehensive voting reform to help continue the work that those marchers and so many others throughout our history sacrificed to build a more free more fair democratic society
6122404 this legislation will establish an american national health insurance program
6122405 it is for this reason that i am in support of this legislation and i encourage you to continue to send the message to congress of the urgent need to pass the expanded amp improved medicare for all act

6122409 were very pleased that the court recognized that the mbtas legal arguments were meritless
6122410 the mbtas attempts to silence these students were not only misguided but blatantly unconstitutional
6122411 far better off focusing on improving the mbtas fare payment security instead of pursuing needless litigation
6122412 im not sure house is capable of love the way other people are i think hes so disconnected to himself in that way that it would be impossible for him to truly be able to connect to somebody else
6122413 i think that she lives vicariously through him because shes a very smart woman who is very successful as a doctor and has a great job and a wonderful position but also has had less and less to do with the actual practicing of medicine as the years have gone by so i think shes excited by what he does and how he does it and shes deeply frustrated by him at the same time
6122414 i got my collar through going to church and being in church and doing what i was supposed to do but at the end of the day i wasnt supposed to open a church that just wasnt my calling
6122415 i looked at my strengths this is what i see and what i know music and show business this is the way god wants me to minister not standing in a pulpit with a bible but affecting people in a different way being a fisher of men in a different way my church ended up being the mtv pulpit on wednesday nights

6122422 the state is that great fiction by which everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else
6122423 when somebody persuades me that i am wrong i change my mind what do you do
6122424 whatever it is that government does sensible americans would prefer that the government do it to someone else this is the idea behind foreign policy
6122425 nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing
6122426 never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity

6122450 nuclear fuel services processes uranium and what we do is provide it to them so we have a contract to do that and them becoming now a part of b amp w really wont change that relationship
6122451 well well certainly know the people up there now and so the only problem is if i dont make a shipment theyll probably be calling my boss
6122452 so in that way itll change things a little bit but weve always had a good relationship and were close with nsf so i dont see any of that changing
6122453 y 12 provides enriched uranium to nfs in support of the nnsa naval reactors program for use as feedstock in the manufacturing of fuel for the u s navys fleet of nuclear powered submarines and aircraft carriers

6122479 motivul aceste decizii este dezinformarea care are loc in timpul razboiului ce afecteaza populatia noastra si sa ii ingrijoreaza pe cetateni
6122480 rusia nu are media deloc eu nu as numi o media ceea ce difuzeaza si publica ei este doar propaganda si noi nu dorim sa alertam populatia cu aceasta dezinformare nu stiu cand le vom permite sa emita din nou vom vedea

6122511 yesterday senator obama got a little testy on this issue he said that i am questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6122512 senator obama has made it clear that he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq even today with victory in sight over and over again he has advocated unconditional withdrawal regardless of the facts on the ground
6122513 he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt seem to understand the consequences of an american defeat in iraq how it would risk a wider war and threaten the security of american families
6122514 we are pleased that judge bellows ruled in our favor on these questions he ruled very clearly that our congregations are able to rely on the virginia division statute in order to keep our church property we have maintained all along that our churches own trustees hold title for the benefit of their congregations tec and the diocese have never owned any of the properties and their names do not appear on deeds to the property the virginia supreme court has consistently stated that virginia does not recognize denominational trusts of the sort asserted by tec and the diocese
6122515 given todays ruling we hope and pray that tec and the diocese would put away this needless litigation we have consistently remained open to exploring avenues for amicable discussions and have been grieved that tec has chosen to continue to pursue a path of confrontation rather than civil dialogue this litigation has done nothing to spread the good news of jesus christ

6122518 nobody wants to die i sure dont but you know what first you get to live for a hundred years think about that youll be older than great grandma huey
6122519 even if its a long way away it will come and i dont want it to i want to stay alive
6122520 its such a strange thing to think about sometimes it scares me but you know what whenever im scared of dying i remember that being scared means im not understanding it right
6122521 thats how i think of it sometimes too and that frrrrreaks me out but thats not how it is

6122525 okay now where was i a hundred years ago before i was born
6122526 yep its exactly the same theres no difference at all between not existing before you were born and not existing after you die none so if you werent scared then you shouldnt be scared about going back to it i still get scared sometimes because i forget that but then i try to really understand it again and i feel much better
6122527 i think about the egg that came down into my mommys tummy right before me and the one before that and before that all of those people never even got a chance to exist and they never will there are billions and trillions of people who never even got a chance to be here but i made it i get a chance to be alive and playing and laughing and dancing and burping and farting
6122528 i could have just not existed forever but instead i get to be alive for a hundred years woohoo

6122544 when youre riding a motorcycle if youre passing by a bakery you can smell the fresh bread being baked on the other hand if youre behind a garbage truck youre going to smell that garbage truck

6122546 i ride a motorcycle because i enjoy the stress reduction it provides me when riding out on back roads it really enables you to see parts of the country you miss in a car being on a motorcycle requires you to be much more aware of your surroundings enabling you to notice many things on the road that we usually take for granted
6122547 my dad always spoke about that experience with a twinkle in his eye
6122548 a daredevil by nature he passed this trait onto me he was not pleased to learn of my new hobby when i first started riding i tried to remind him that i was merely following in his footsteps

6122550 early in the game they made a lot of tough shots
6122551 we were doing what we were supposed to be doing and they made tough shots but sooner or later well impose our will i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6122552 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat
6122553 theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend
6122554 theyre a force to be reckoned with they caused us a lot of problems
6122555 in the third quarter we said the first three or four minutes we need to pick it up a little bit defensively and make the extra pass offensively
6122556 he threw a couple of nice strikes into the end zone today and
6122557 we were notified of this exploit back in june during the last maawg messaging anti abuse working group this notification came well before the exploit was public knowledge and at about the same time as dan kaminsky was briefing u s homeland security at that time various venders were hard at work creating patches for this flaw this early warning gave us ample time to verify that all of our external facing dns servers are all authoritative and that tucows and our resellers and by extension our resellers customers are safe from this flaw
6122558 people get nothing out of the government so they feel that everything outside of their personal space is not their problem
6122559 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
6122560 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
6122561 each one would measure about 1 5cm by 3 cm
6122562 they were designed to be complete robots with different kinds of actuators for gripping cell manipulation and so on each one would be wireless with lots of electronics on board and an infrared control system rather like a tv remote but
6122563 for the majority of the night he made the other team look severely handicapped schreibers performance on thursday was living proof that fat people cannot play dodgeball
6122564 hes pitched another great ballgame tonight for us he throws hard with a good curveball and a good changeup and on top of that is what a good competitor he is
6122565 i wanted to keep things simple on a warm humid evening
6122566 i was just trying to stay around the zone and try to make them make contact and thats kind of the way it worked out i just cant believe how many pitches they took
6122567 you know we didnt score a single run in the second or third innings at all that was a little disappointing to me in my eyes
6122568 if that was a really good team a team of our caliber you cant take them for granted score when you can you gotta score early and you have to score often i wanted to score 23 runs in the first inning to end it and head to applebees immediately for all you can eat riblets but this is a learning process and a great experience to build on
6122569 these type of box scores just make a manager smile geniusly
6122570 i just want to thank my unbelievable skill and talent those two attributes of mine have really helped me achieve some top level accomplishments
6122571 ive played around with a couple of things the past couple of weeks but i think that this line up gives us the best chance to win at the moment and should some freak accident happens well have a sub readily accessible without penalty
6122572 there is a specific song i want her to do on the soundtrack
6122573 now that new line has sort of expunged itself from existence

6122588 this form of corruption is one of the worst for the sector
6122589 when such corruption is tackled successfully then we can have stable power

6122591 guidelines for use of hydrogen fuel in commercial vehicles final report
6122592 today virtually all commercial trucks are powered by diesel fuel while private cars are fueled by gasoline supported by our national energy policy a new generation of technologies is currently being developed that allow the use of hydrogen as a fuel to power cars and trucks in the future hydrogen may be used in one of three ways to power vehicles to produce electricity in a fuel cell as a replacement for gasoline or diesel fuel in an internal combustion engine or as a supplement to gasoline or diesel fuel used in an internal combustion engine
6122593 there are several ways that hydrogen can be used as a motor fuel it can be used to directly replace gasoline or diesel fuel in specially designed internal combustion engines ices or it can be used to supplement these typical fuels in existing engines in either of these cases the vehicle drive system will be identical to those used on most gasoline powered or diesel powered vehicles the engine will drive the vehicles wheels through a transmission drive shaft and front or rear axle
6122594 a hydrogen injection system for a diesel engine produces small amounts of hydrogen and oxygen on demand by electrolyzing water carried onboard the vehicle the electricity required is supplied by the engines alternator or 12 24 volt electrical system see section 1 5 for a description of electrolysis the hydrogen and oxygen are injected into the engines air intake manifold where they mix with the intake air in theory the combustion properties of the hydrogen result in more complete combustion of diesel fuel in the engine reducing tailpipe emissions and improving fuel economy chec n d
6122595 a hydrogen injection system for a diesel engine produces and uses significantly less hydrogen than a hydrogen fuel cell or hydrogen ice and does not require that compressed or liquid hydrogen be carried on the vehicle the system is designed to produce hydrogen only when required in response to driver throttle commands when the system is shut off no hydrogen is present on the vehicle
6122596 limited laboratory testing of a hydrogen injection system installed on an older diesel truck engine operated at a series of constant speeds showed a 4 percent reduction in fuel use and a 7 percent reduction in particulate emissions with the system on etvc 2005

6122610 before 9 11 2001 we had nearly succeeded at paying down the debt thanks to record surpluses due in large part to a booming domestic economy real federal cost cutting was not in the vernacular then anymore than it is now but following the horrible tragedies of that day the us once again started down a path of uncontrolled government spending without a way to pay for it thanks to the cost of military action in the middle east and afghanistan not to mention slower increases in tax receipts due to a faltering economy on the home front the us once again fell into a spending free fall

6122652 if you think about the food chain all the way from where you grow the food to the ultimate consumer if you dont have a packaging the waste rate all the way from the field to you or me will be huge if you look at the end situation of any cup of coffee you see that the carbon footprint used by the packaging of any cup of coffee is insignificant compared to what the cow does
6122653 if you do it the other way round you take the packaging away you take the carbon footprint of the packaging away but you create a significant waste along the way before the product meets you
6122654 our alternative in that case is that if we dont want to use packaging then we need to dismantle the big cities and go back to the fields and we dont have waste if we pick up the potatoes and eat them in the village we live in

6122671 nick diaz is the no 1 contender k j noons should step up and be the champion that we think he is and take this fight nick diaz will take this fight any place anywhere
6122672 i dont understand it this fight on cbs is maximum exposure and the opportunity for maximum sponsorship dollars way more than he could make on showtime at this point i question his management
6122673 we believe in k j as our champion for some reason his camp is not coming straight out and saying no but they are making it very difficult to make it happen
6122674 his manager doesnt want us talking to him directly who knows what k j even knows about the situation but his management is holding us hostage
6122675 hopefully k j wants the fight and hopefully he will instruct his management to take the fight
6122676 k j signed a contract all we want is for him to honor that contract fight on oct 4 on cbs and prove that hes the champion we think he is right now hes not representing us as the elitexc champion

6122688 a police lawyer called me yesterday tuesday and said that the police simply dont have the manpower for the job theyre afraid of riots and soon u s secretary of state condoleeza rice is coming to the region and soon it will be ramadan etc etc but she promised over and over that for sure before the high holidays nearly six weeks from now ed they will do it
6122689 the eviction is a very sensitive on behalf of a jew living in hevron sic he actually lives in kiryat arba ed and the property is located in an arab neighborhood it should also be noted that the eviction was set for approximately a week before the onset of the ramadan month in my estimation the police deployment for the eviction will be very intensive because of the expectation of riots after the eviction and it will lead into the ramadan fasts similarly it will involve the deployment of many policemen on the day on which u s secretary rice is expected which will make it very difficult based on this we ask for a flexible eviction order beginning from oct 5 2008 until feb 1 2009
6122690 but they even want to put it off for several months and how can the police lawyer make a promise to golbert that they will do it before rosh hashanah when the days before rosh hashanah are still in the month of ramadan how can i believe them
6122691 most unfortunately no if the police explain that they cant carry it out then the court will believe them and thats that
6122692 they have made this into a soap opera and a circus i would like to believe them when they say they will do it in a month but its very hard for me to do so because of how they have stalled and pushed this off so many times in the past and because of what they are promising now

6122734 increasing homeownership and reinvigorating neighborhoods is one of the most powerful things we can do to improve our economy and our communities this federal funding will help to do exactly that in california and will be administered by our department of housing and community development to also make vital infrastructure improvements and provide assistance to those are most in need
6122735 this important funding will work in partnership with our proposition 1c which the voters of californiaapproved in order to improve housing infrastructure in our state

6122738 who is the haryana chief minister to have the courage to meddle in sikh religious affairs this is all being done at the instance of the congress high command
6122739 disastrous course as punjab and the country has already paid too heavy a price for similar misadventures of the congress in the past
6122740 we are a peace loving community but that does not mean we will remain a mute witness if our religion is under attack we have borne political and economic injustice stoically but the congress would be living in a fools paradise if it thinks it can get away with its attempts to weaken the khalsa panth

6122749 we had a private room and the food was all themed around the olympics
6122750 i had a not so great experience at a place where there was no english translation for the menu and i just pointed and hoped for the best
6122751 it was not the best not even sure what it was
6122752 all of the chains are here mcdonalds tgifridays outback and kfc are everywhere
6122753 there are also a lot of barbecue places but not the barbecue of the west it is a place where the meat is cooked on a barbecue grill in the center of the table
6122754 i have cooked on a real wok and it is great
6122755 it sounds like a jet engine when it is fired up
6122756 that is something that they do not do much of because 90 percent of everything is cooked in a wok they were also a little skeptical about meatloaf not a dish most of them have ever seen before
6122757 i must say that it is a very impressive sight to see

6122761 the savings come mainly from eliminating pain and suffering damages and reducing legal fees
6122762 lawyers too often employ highly polished rhetorical tools to melodramatically frame cases as good guys against bad guys
6122763 this helps retain a crucial element of the tort systems deterrence mechanism
6122764 injured parties could still win suitably large monetary awards under the early offers model for both economic and pain and suffering damages in clear cases of aggravated error but less than 5 percent of todays injury liability cases are even allegedly the result of any gross misconduct
6122765 such savings are accompanied by much prompter payment of injured parties essential losses which ought to be the aim of any insurance program
6122766 we treated russia for a long time as a defeated nation and many of russias natural interests and concerns were not taken into account
6122767 in the last seven or eight years russia was getting stronger and began to defend its national interests more vigorously
6122768 this is another paradigm in our relations with russia that hasnt yet been accepted that russia is a significant player in the international arena
6122769 i was very depressed in abkhazia because it was inconceivable for me to imagine that georgians and abkhazians would be killing each other
6122770 my family had spent almost every summer in abkhazia a beautiful place like california or florida in this country but on the black sea meeting internally displaced people who had fled from abkhazia they had lost everything their homes identities and hope in the future my heart was bleeding
6122771 the russians were carefully watching this volatile region and ready to intervene in case of exactly this type of development
6122772 put yourself in russian president dmitry medvedevs shoes what would a regional superpower do
6122773 but this crisis gives a good chance for russia the u s and europe to restore a constructive relationship and expand their cooperation rather than accuse each other of wrongdoings that will depend on the wisdom of their leaders

6122775 reads along with you while you do the reading whether youre younger or older new to reading or have your own library this program should be able to help you read more and understand more of what you read
6122776 shatters the myth that computers must sound robotic and monotonous just imagine having web pages and e mail read aloud to you if you are finding there is just too much on screen reading with all of this technology then you will love using readplease
6122777 with clicker 4 the computer is set to read automatically as soon as a period full stop is used this has been great in reinforcing the use of capital letters and full stops my son is able to check his work as he goes and edits immediately instead of waiting until the end when he has forgotten what he has written he prefers the voice in this program as the other was more or less on one tone he is more able to independently find correct spellings and he is able to listen to each word then select the one he needs this is helping him to work with greater independence and is building his confidence to try and complete a task
6122778 the kurzeil 3000 is the greatest tool to benefit the dyslexic student my high school students can bring in a library book or an article etc and scan the material one class period and listen follow along the next period the students can use bookmarks and change the voice and speed that it reads to their individual tastes the kurzweil also comes with a cd with numerous works available to be read without scanning with the cd you just find the author and click locate the story you need and click and start listening the classroom teachers are really great about sending the reading assignments to me a few days ahead of time so i can have them scanned and ready to read this helps the students because they stay on schedule sometimes students come in after and before school to scan articles so they will be able to keep pace with other students therefore extended time isnt necessary the bottom line is that it is a wonderful tool that gives the students a sense of independence
6122779 the white coat ceremony is unique in that it celebrates both the end of a long admissions process and the beginning of their professional careers

6122786 the certificate is the starting point of the joint effort between the nelson institute and the school of business it really is interdisciplinary
6122787 these people are coming from different perspectives and that makes the certificate stronger
6122788 we are not living in the same world that we were living in the 60s and 70s businesses are thinking proactively and anticipating the role that they are going to be playing in this new world
6122789 in the past all business worried about was making a profit business is still interested in making a profit but they are seeing that to maximize their profit potential they have to account for environmental and social issues we are trying to prepare students for this new consciousness this new awareness of the role businesses play in society
6122790 this interdisciplinary certificate really underscores the complexity of the health care experience for patients in the 21st century we have courses all over campus
6122791 the certificate pulls together courses across campus from social work business economics nursing law public affairs medicine and industrial engineering so that advocates are well rounded and prepared to advocate for patients
6122792 if this certificate raises the knowledge of advocacy and the importance of having advocacy skills we have accomplished an important goal
6122793 uw madison has faculty from many different disciplines really engaged in questions around the relationships between environmental and cultural change through the full sweep of human history
6122794 its very intellectually stimulating but it creates its own set of challenges
6122795 it gives graduate students exposure to the many different ways of thinking about environmental history through anthropology through history through history of science though rural sociology
6122796 theyve been doing it on their own already but this helps channel ideas and bring them visibility
6122797 the idea is that teachers in the public school should be teaching from a global perspective we thought the three credit requirement was not enough
6122798 we wanted a broad certificate that focused on non western history and contemporary culture we want all undergraduates to have the opportunity to gain more global perspective
6122799 this certificate is an opportunity for undergraduates to develop a more comprehensive global view to view themselves as world citizens for all undergrads it will build a respect for diversity and treat all people with dignity and respect
6122800 it may be a case where they got out on their own and just havent reported in yet
6122801 the 100x100 project strives to create technology that will make it viable for all 100 million homes in the u s to have at least 100 megabits per second of connectivity we believe this will provide the needed catalyst for the next generation of technological innovation that will stimulate economic growth for the country and re establish the united states as a leader in the internet age

6122818 early in the formation of a galaxy or solar system there exists a large roughly spherical swarm of small particles and molecules whizzing about the center of mass in seemingly random directions although there is always one direction in which more particles tend to be moving than any other direction particles often collide and adhere to each other thus cancelling out much of each others angular momentum eventually larger bodies form and almost all of their angular momentum is channeled in the direction that originally had only slight dominance the concentrating of constituents into a flatter shape produces a gravitational influence which accelerates the process the result is a seemingly well ordered rotating disk system as with a galaxy solar system or most beautifully in the ring system of saturn for which that planets equatorial bulge is a contributing factor

6122838 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
6122839 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is 1 of 4 models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just 5 years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6122840 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
6122841 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option

6122869 jacopo carreras is the dark angel of the lan muzic crew he brings salvation through crushing the customs of listening and reveals his particular vision on what enlightment should be if you have the patience to listen till the end you will understand how wonderfully twisted a straight techno track can be probably the most skilled producer we have met to date he has delivered us a real treat as a j nger of the max sp community he has the ability and the aim to give his sound a special touch nothing to hit the consensus of the dance music crowd but rather something to share with people that enjoy the far end of the musical spektrum the core of his approach is still not lost in space its firmly grounded in the past decade of striking techno but he just ends up somewhere else than most other musicians do

6122902 the polyketal microparticles we developed are simply a vehicle to get the drugs inside the body to the diseased area as quickly as possible
6122903 the major advantage to using these polyketals to deliver drugs is that they degrade into biocompatible compounds that dont accumulate in a patients tissue or cause additional inflammation
6122904 we think these microparticles are going to be fantastic for oral drug delivery because they can survive the stomach conditions before they release their contents in the intestines
6122905 patients with acute liver failure need drugs as soon as possible or else theyll die
6122906 weve tailored the polyketals hydrolysis rates to deliver the drug in one or two days
6122907 delivering proteins inside microparticles has been limited because getting the protein into the microparticles required organic solvents that frequently destroyed the proteins
6122908 to overcome this problem we developed a method of simply immobilizing the protein on the surface of the microparticles
6122909 in the past few years we have developed methods to tailor the polyketals properties which have already allowed us to target many different medical conditions but our end goal is to test these treatments in humans

6122911 problems with the use and sizing of graduated compression stockings are common throughout the country and this study is one of the first to systematically analyze the problems and recommend ways to improve practice
6122912 based on the study findings we recommend that knee length stockings be the standard length used and that the education of nurses and patients about the proper use of stockings be improved
6122913 a lot can be done to optimize the benefits of graduated compression stockings and minimize adverse effects
6122914 knee length stockings have many practical advantages over thigh length in that they lower the risk of problems and health care costs the improper use and sizing of these stockings and the deficiencies in patient education are important health care issues
6122915 we interview every owner of every structure that goes on fire
6122916 he is extremely thankful that everyone including his son marquise escaped the burning house safely
6122917 he is confident that authorities will be conducting a thorough investigation of the incident and is eager to review their findings
6122918 i spoke to anne gripper at the uci and said we are willing to pay you can go and hire whoever you want they can have access all areas
6122919 they can go into peoples homes forget human rights go and have a look and if you can find anything let me know
6122920 ive said before come and live with us see what we do how we live how we train come and look at our training books all the data weve got gathered and youll see a slow progression over time and that doesnt happen if youre taking drugs were as open as can be anyone can come and look at what we do
6122921 when i was a young rider coming through the ranks i saw jason queally who i trained with and who was a bit older standing on the podium and i knew he was clean
6122922 he had won an olympic gold medal clean and i thought if he can do it clean i can do it i would hope people would realise that this hasnt come out of the blue its been 12 years in the making four years in the planning
6122923 of all sports in cycling when you get a standout set of performances people are always going to raise an eyebrow theyve been proven wrong so many times before that its here we go again and its only a matter of time until were found out
6122924 im pretty sure we can show everybody that with some intuitive thinking and not sticking to conventional wisdom you can achieve things clean its not just physical there have been technological and psychological innovations a whole range of things which have fed in to achieving a new standard of performance
6122925 theyd be out there was an incident i wont mention names but there was someone who disappeared for a little while although they turned out to have totally legitimate reasons and so i phoned up to have them randomly tested you need to protect the team and the authenticity of the results thats a professional responsibility of mine
6122926 weve stepped up to a whole new level since the world championships but what is more surprising to me is not so much that we have done that because there are reasons for that our preparation our training and our planning but that some nations have underperformed and the gap has been exaggerated
6122927 i want somebody who is mad right now that people are losing their jobs and is mad right now that people are seeing their incomes decline
6122928 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
6122929 i will let no one question my love of this country
6122930 i love america so do you and so does john mccain you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
6122931 sen mccain was already turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
6122932 sen mccain predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues
6122933 i wish he had been right and i had been wrong but thats not what history shows
6122934 wow now i have a great connection with this editor i wonder if she wants me to write another one
6122935 the pakistani army absolutely understands its priority is not india but is internal
6122936 some of the thinking in the army is in accordance with what petraeus has done in iraq
6122937 they see the need for quick impact projects such as those funded by u s army commanders in troubled iraqi districts

6122958 im shocked an 11 year old first of all was even out at that time let alone breaking into a gun shop
6122959 i wasnt stunned i was shocked i just could not believe that an 11 year old kid would be involved in something like this its just deplorable
6122960 its just a scary thought that in todays society kids are stealing guns like this and putting them back on the street
6122961 this is the scary underbelly of the activity thats going on that has resulted in a number of shots fired incidents aggravated assaults with firearms and in fact gunshot homicides not only here in delaware county but in philadelphia and throughout the region
6122962 these kinds of weapons on the street are the type of weapons that we frequently find used in the commission of crimes obviously violent crimes and homicides
6122963 it just goes to show you how important the community is
6122964 without the witness last night i do not feel these arrests would have been possible

6123019 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
6123020 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

6123022 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
6123023 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
6123024 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
6123025 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
6123026 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
6123027 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
6123028 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
6123029 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
6123030 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
6123031 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
6123032 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
6123033 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
6123034 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
6123035 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
6123036 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

6123120 ive not really had a whole lot to say to tell you the truth
6123121 as to when ill be back on the practice field thats still to be determined obviously the sooner the better for me my goal is to be back for the first game
6123122 this maybe will stop some of the whining going on
6123123 i just didnt want to get into these daily progress reports
6123124 if were to the point of someone putting a cell phone picture on the news thats a little disappointing so i guess ill squash that right now its not true i dont wear a knee brace
6123125 i dont know if any of those injured guys will be out there on the 7th but my guess is they will be
6123126 i think im close to 100 percent im definitely good enough to compete and play
6123127 its great to be running around with my teammates instead of standing around wishing you were out there
6123128 rehabbing is something ill have to continue to do throughout my career whats important is to continue to use that time to make sure youre mentally sharp

6123133 im very pleased with his response to not being in the team and we have to remember that he has come back from his injury two months earlier than expected
6123134 i think the gaffers searching around to try and find the right one that can come in here and whos got the right character im sure that before the window closes the manager will have that guy in and then its up to the four of us to battle it out to get in the game
6123135 i think i definitely need one the type of player i am the size i am ive always played better with bigger target men alongside me i think the other two that weve got need that as well
6123136 im only 21 and i know that i still have a lot to learn
6123137 i hope this season will be very good for me
6123138 this is completely untrue and a case of irresponsible reporting

6123145 ive been looking at some aston martins and some maseratis it would be pretty sweet to get an old school aston martin some of the old school james bond ones that would be sick
6123146 it kind of bugs me im always getting rocked i need to get my video game skills up thats for sure
6123147 i would rather it be three months but i wanted it to be five so that it was probably longer than he wants and when he comes back hes really ready to come back
6123148 hes on his own now he makes all the decisions outside the pool and i take care of the pool
6123149 in athens he had never had any personal freedom at all now hes had a lot and hes screwed it up and hes learned what that means hes done a pretty good job with it i had my doubts in the beginning that we were going to get there but now i think hes got it down
6123150 it sounds really cliched but its true hes really grown as a human being
6123151 that in itself is going to serve him well as he makes these decisions in the upcoming few months and few years
6123152 i think hell just want to be a celebrity whatever that means hell just have to keep improving if he wants to do that he handles himself so much better than he did i was just amazed at some of the answers he gave to a lot of these questions this time
6123153 im happy to help him out if he wants a hand with some of these things
6123154 i think its just distant i dont think its good or bad theres not much there
6123155 its like michael said the other day debbie wants to go to rome i want to go to rome thats why were going
6123156 itll just be what it is he could probably do without it
6123157 we just have to play it by ear and see how things go but definitely start some new events and see where it takes us

6123172 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
6123173 irrigation fed agriculture provides 45 percent of the worlds food supplies and without it we could not feed our planets population of six billion people
6123174 progress and prospects on water for a clean and healthy world with special focus on sanitation
6123175 the number of people living without a supply of improved drinking water has now dropped well below one billion
6123176 more than half the global population now have water piped to their homes and the number of people using unimproved water supplies continues to decline
6123177 the regional sanitation conferences for example such as latinosan africasan easan and sacosan produced unprecedented declarations that provide a strong foundation for developing the water and sanitation sector in these regions
6123178 it also provides a solid basis for further developing the sector in africa i personally consider this result to be an enormous leap forward
6123179 the reports worrying conclusion is that at the current rate the world will miss its mdg sanitation target by more than 700 million people if we are to reach the target we now need to provide at least 173 million people per year with access to improved sanitation
6123180 you show the same commitment and willpower and the olympic dream is also your dream to strive for a bright future of mankind one world one dream a world in which everyone can lead a healthy life in dignity a world that offers the chance of personal development for all this is our common dream
6123181 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
6123182 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
6123183 of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
6123184 and it isnt just affluent consumers of exotic vegetables whose welfare is at stake
6123185 poor consumers of inexpensive street food also depend on urban agriculture
6123186 even this tiny proportion however would be enough for humans to live on earth if the water cycle was properly functioning and if we managed our water use wisely
6123187 water management for human needs alone is damaging the natural systems we all depend on
6123188 we are also concerned that the world continues to mainly discuss adaption to climate change rather than doing it
6123189 we have been doing it all over the world and we have found that that improving the health of freshwater ecosystems now makes a great contribution to improving their resilience to climate impacts in the future

6123191 watching television can slow the development of children under 3 even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them

6123199 i only managed to leave gaza in april when i trained in amman for one month and then one month in china as part of the olympic solidarity programme
6123200 im not happy with my result but thats all due to a lack of competition
6123201 when youre away and out of competition like this you cant compete against the champions
6123202 i kept pace for the first 2000m but after that i needed to show more endurance which i didnt have because of my lack of competition
6123203 i am proud to represent palestine but its not enough
6123204 how come a whole building caught fire in an hour where are the fire alarms and where are the sprinklers
6123205 but in 1998 we managed to control the fire in the room it erupted in
6123206 we heard air conditioners blowing up and wooden shutters caught fire and flew in the air
6123207 we brought our extinguishers to be ready in case of the fire reached our building
6123208 both candidates will end the war and bring our troops home the difference is that i will win it first

6123211 it is true that people were killed but figures are inflated
6123212 it is true that there is a war between the government and rebels but why is that rebels against the government are considered downtrodden it is double standard
6123213 clubs like liverpool are always looking round the world for players and there is always going to be someone new challenging you
6123214 it was sudden one day i was a liverpool player the next i was going to leave
6123215 i just wanted to make sure i got the best possible club there was no way i was going to be comfortable playing for another english club and i had plenty of offers from other clubs in the premier league
6123216 i didnt have to leave because i had another year left but i did want to be playing regularly and i didnt feel that would happen this season if i stayed
6123217 hopefully denman and kauto wont meet before the gold cup again this season but its a long year and a lot can happen between now and then

6123222 say a person with a dial up connection wants to download a file
6123223 when running donatebandwidth their computer starts downloading part of a file while also sending a request for other donatebandwidth users who have access through the same isp and whose computers have spare bandwidth to trigger them to start downloading other parts of the same file
6123224 donatebandwidth permits sharing of unused internet bandwidth which is much more valuable in the developing world compared to computing cycles or disk space
6123225 typical bandwidth savings due to caching are around 30 to 40 percent
6123226 in pakistan and a lot of developing countries they are building a good local network but the international network is not very good
6123227 having a system like what saif proposed is very valuable
6123228 misconfiguration of caches rings true with our experiences in kenya and ghana
6123229 i doubt anybody outside of a developing country would have come up with donatebandwidth

6123232 when youre riding a motorcycle if youre passing by a bakery you can smell the fresh bread being baked on the other hand if youre behind a garbage truck youre going to smell that garbage truck
6123233 but youre out there in the environment up close with the wind blowing in your face on a hot summer day or the cold wind on a cold winter day
6123234 i ride a motorcycle because i enjoy the stress reduction it provides me when riding out on back roads it really enables you to see parts of the country you miss in a car being on a motorcycle requires you to be much more aware of your surroundings enabling you to notice many things on the road that we usually take for granted
6123235 my dad always spoke about that experience with a twinkle in his eye
6123236 a daredevil by nature he passed this trait onto me he was not pleased to learn of my new hobby when i first started riding i tried to remind him that i was merely following in his footsteps

6123250 its about developing it in a healthy way before it discharges inappropriately
6123251 its like these extreme experiences where they drop a group of three or four guys without food and water into the middle of the wilderness and they have to survive for four or five days and they come out feeling like they are brothers
6123252 we are here to test ourselves and test each other but the default assumption is that we are going to care for each other

6123265 die wenigstens patienten sp ren einen zu hohen bluthochdruck meist erst wenn er extrem hoch ist
6123266 nur etwa ein viertel der patienten ist medikament s gut eingestellt
6123267 bei einem weiteren viertel ist der bluthochdruck diagnostiziert die patienten sind aber nicht ausreichend mit medikamenten versorgt
6123268 bei den meisten hypertonie patienten sind allerdings keine eindeutigen ursachen f r zu hohen blutdruck zu finden
6123269 erstmals wird jetzt das gesamte genom der betroffenen auf ver nderungen untersucht

6123273 das gehirn reagiert darauf und setzt k rpereigene mechanismen zur blutdrucksenkung in gang die gef e werden stark erweitert
6123274 bei einer patientin die die therapie mit f nf medikamenten nicht vertragen hatte konnte der blutdruck dauerhaft um 60 bis 70 mmhg verringert werden
6123275 die meisten patienten mit diesen extrem hohen werten m ssen zwar weiterhin medikamente nehmen doch dank der blutdrucksenkung mithilfe des schrittmachers ist die gefahr drastisch gesunken folgekrankheiten zu erleiden
6123276 wenn die ergebnisse der auf ein jahr angelegten studie positiv sind k nnte der impfstoff bereits in vier jahren auf den markt kommen
6123277 die patienten m ssten nicht regelm ig ihre medikamente einnehmen sondern w ren mit einer einzigen impfung f r einen l ngeren zeitraum gesch tzt
6123278 eine blutdrucksenkung von bis zu 20 mmhg konnte nachgewiesen werden allerdings hielt der erfolg nur wenige monate an

6123282 the kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son
6123283 then he sent some more servants and said tell those who have been invited that i have prepared my dinner my oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered and every thing is ready come to the wedding banquet but they paid no attention and went off one to his field another to his business the rest seized his servants mistreated them and killed them the king was enraged he sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city then he said to his servants the wedding banquet is ready but those i invited did not deserve to come go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find so the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find both good and bad and the wedding hall was filled with guests but when the king came in to see the guests he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes friend he asked how did you get in here without wedding clothes the man was speechless then the king told the attendants tie him hand and foot and throw him outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are invited but few are chosen

6123375 these findings provide further evidence that the health system is falling short of where it needs to be to ensure health and economic security
6123376 we need a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance available
6123377 what is notable is how this is spreading up the income scale
6123378 even adults with insurance reported problems in getting needed care

6123380 granted theyre not slumping too much and the site is still performing extremely well but it is down nonetheless i think digg slowly lost its appeal when it stopped becoming a tech savvy haven and tried to expand into areas that its tech influenced crowd didnt care about
6123381 yahoo buzz is taking the digg idea improving it by reducing the frequency of people gaming it and launching with a focus on all topics with its own main page to back it up
6123382 how can digg compete on any one of those levels when digg was firmly focused on tech and didnt try to improve algorithms to make upcoming stories last longer before they went popular or stop certain influencers from being too successful people found some value in using the site but now its nothing more than a placeholder of derivative stories and outrageous comment threads
6123383 not just any stories will end up getting buzzed but when they do they get posted to the front page of yahoo com
6123384 thats some pretty major exposure and the level of traffic driven by yahoo once something gets buzzed is exponentially higher than most other social news sites including digg
6123385 i think the potential that future submissions could appear on the front page of yahoo com is a valuable prospect
6123386 i think yahoos system is going to result in much better front page headlines its less about who you know and more about the actual content
6123387 the possibility of getting on the home page of yahoo is a strong selling point for buzz on the other hand theyre a bit late to the game to open it up to everyone i think for certain types of news it could do well but on topics like tech itll be tough
6123388 yahoo does amazing things like delicious and flickr but then they do other really lame things like yahoo

6123402 aeryck and pistos both play their roles extremely well and are among the first to master new fights both take pride in what they do and rarely make mistakes their personal preparation is top notch
6123403 both are open with sharing their professions with others in game aeryck took it upon himself to supply resurgent with cauldrons for our ros attempts pistos regularly speaks up in guild chat to provide enchants for others
6123404 pistos is active on the forums whether it is offering up advice on the game or just generally adding some levity and character to the conversations
6123405 pistos is willing to jump to an alt to craft etc for others in the guild even when that person hasnt been in
6123406 pistos is a high quality player with a high quality attitude he is a pleasure to game with and im proud to be his guildmate
6123407 aeryck appears comfortable in any group in this guild he is so easy going and willing to help others he is relatively quiet when it comes to speaking up in the forums or guild chat but if there is way he can help out someone in need he always seems to volunteer his time
6123408 all i will say is that i think aeryck is a perfect choice for one of the first to receive the vet rank he has always been fun to group with whether in 5 mans or raids whether hes on his rogue warrior or lock he plays them all well his dedication to progression while still having fun is one of his best qualities he asks for nothing in return if a guild mate needs something i cannot imagine him anywhere except here with us
6123409 aeryck has a great attitude he knows his toon and he is very loyal to tactical gamer hes never been hesitant to fill whichever roll is needed among his classes and from what i have seen is always willing to help out when amp where he is needed hes also very knowledgeable when it comes to the classes he plays and is willing to help anyone out with different aspects of the classes he does so in a way that leaves the player feeling confident about any changes made

6123421 the fact that georgias defense minister davit kezerashvili is a former israeli who is fluent in hebrew contributed to this cooperation
6123422 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
6123423 the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement

6123459 neeraj why dont we move into one of the gated community apartments near our office they have all the facilities it seems you know how much time it takes everyday commuting to the office and back
6123460 yeah i was also thinking about that for some time but what would i tell my father he took a lot of pains to construct this house in the middle of the city and i know what this house means to my father he is emotionally attached to this house i still remember those days when we didnt have so much money how much efforts my father put into buying the plot and constructing the house he sacrificed a lot shruti in fact all of us did to build his dream house he will never leave this house
6123461 all that is fine neeraj but times have changed now and people have their priorities i am not talking about the comforts there neeraj but i am talking about the strain we undergo daily just for commuting
6123462 let all of us move then we will leave this house on rent
6123463 neeraj try to understand its not like we are fighting with them and leaving them for ever we are just looking for a reasonable solution
6123464 in fact i was also thinking about talking about this to you shruti maybe we could come here every weekend and we will not ask for any money from them for purchasing the flat well manage the installments ourselves
6123465 money is not an issue neeraj but i was concerned if they get ill or something who would take care of them
6123466 we are just going to be two hours away shruti and we could also appoint a nurse to take care of them if required i was thinking they may become lonely
6123467 they could always come and stay with us neeraj right now we may not be able to afford a two bedroom apartment but we will in a few years it is only until then talk to your father neeraj
6123468 dad me and shruti have decided to buy one of the apartments coming up near our it park you know how much time we spend every day traveling and of course we wish that you sell this house and come along with us

6123562 there has to be tougher rules because indigenous people just arent taking up the jobs if youre not prepared to put your hand up for a job no matter where it is we shouldnt have to continue paying the dole the vast majority of indigenous people need to work and are ready to work

6123584 colorado law is supportive of homeschoolers and we dont take that for granted especially considering recent homeschool issues in california
6123585 i love the ability to be with my boys understand them better and shape their lives
6123586 i received an excellent public school education i was valedictorian of my high school class a national merit finalist and went on to receive my finance summa cum laude and mba degrees from the university of denver in a total of four years
6123587 yet i am still amazed at all of the knowledge and fabulous literature i was not exposed to in the public school environment homeschooling with sonlight curriculum the literature based program we use has been the springboard for me to learn even more than my great education taught me and i get to learn right along with my husband and children
6123588 the books we read are fantastic i think sonlight offers one of the greatest educations you can find
6123589 we ask the boys every year if they want to keep homeschooling and they always tell me they love it and want to keep going
6123590 i like that when you homeschool your teacher works specifically with you and if you have a problem your teacher works with you to fix it also there arent as many distractions as in public school with a ton of other kids around
6123591 id rather go to homeschool than public school because i like not having to come home after school and do what i should have already done at school i get to be with mom or dad all day and i get to read a lot
6123592 midday we usually go for a walk with the dog to give us all some exercise and a little break we usually read lots of good books together through lunch and do whatever is left in the afternoon we leave at 4pm for soccer practice so were pretty much going strong all day
6123593 in the last month i have been flabbergasted that no less than five strangers have come up to me and specifically commented on my sons good manners
6123594 i really think homeschooling has a lot to do with this because my husband and i can teach our sons how to behave as we work through our day in our society basic life skills training just doesnt seem to be happening often outside the home context judging from the general behavior of the children i have seen
6123595 we are so happy with our decision to educate our children at home
6123596 homeschooling is not for everyone thats for sure but i think its a wonderful way to raise your kids

6123647 if obama cant stand up to the clintons after they have been defeated how can he measure up to a resurgent putin who has just achieved a military victory
6123648 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record

6123653 is a bit unusual for this late in the campaign in a state where senator mccain has been for so long
6123654 the negative attack ad program that the senator has been running not only in arizona but across the country is beginning to create a bit of an anti obama factor in the state
6123655 thirty eight percent of the people in arizona said mccain was running a negative campaign and about half that many people said obama was
6123656 it is as if she is the real daughter i am also a real daughter
6123657 i saw him at christmas and i spent my birthdays with him
6123658 mrs mccain was raised as the only child of jim and marguerite hensley and there was no familiar relationship with any other sibling
6123659 im angry it makes me feel like a nonperson kind of
6123660 it doesnt make any kind of sense at all portalski said yesterday
6123661 he was generous over the years when i was growing up so it doesnt compute that he would do that that he would leave all of us out
6123662 the human brain is always trying to determine why things happen and when the reason is not clear we tend to make up some pretty bizarre explanations
6123663 christians and new agers paranormalists etc all have one thing in common a spiritual orientation to the world
6123664 i believe they do exist but im not sure about this
6123665 i guess we will find out if this is on the up and up
6123666 while it is difficult to know for certain the tendency to believe in the paranormal appears to be there from the beginning
6123667 what changes is the content of the paranormal for example very few people believe in faeries and elves these days but as belief in faeries faded other beliefs such as belief in ufos emerged to take their place
6123668 it is an artifact of our brains desire to find cause and effect
6123669 that ability to predict the future is what makes humans smart but it also has side effects like superstitions and belief in the paranormal
6123670 humans first started believing in the supernatural because they were trying to understand things they couldnt explain
6123671 its basically the same process as mythology at one point people didnt understand why the sun rose and set each day so they suggested that a chariot pulled the sun across the heavens
6123672 they didnt understand why a child was stillborn or why a drought occurred so they came to believe that such events had supernatural causes
6123673 all societies have invoked the supernatural to explain things beyond their control and understanding especially good and bad events
6123674 in many places even today people believe that disasters or bad luck is caused by witches or curses
6123675 i believe that new orleans had a level of sin that was offensive to god and they are were recipients of the judgment of god for that
6123676 paranormal beliefs are very strongly negatively related to religious belief
6123677 this may partly reflect opinions of christians in the samples who take biblical sanctions against many paranormal activities seriously
6123678 my guess is that religiosity has a lot to do with how you were raised and less to do with genetics
6123679 those people who may have a high genetic susceptibility to faith based knowledge may end up being highly religious or may end up having belief in the paranormal depending on how they were raised those people less susceptible to that method of forming beliefs may still end up being highly religious if they were raised in a religious family
6123680 among christians those who attend church very often and are exposed to stigma and sacrifice within their congregations are least likely to believe in the paranormal
6123681 conversely those christians who do not attend church very often maybe once or twice a year are the most likely to hold paranormal beliefs
6123682 are much less likely to consult horoscopes visit psychics purchase new age items
6123683 however among those christians who do not attend church there is a much higher level of participation in these phenomena
6123684 perhaps amazingly paranormal beliefs are not related at all to education
6123685 ph d s are as likely as high school dropouts to believe in bigfoot loch ness monster ghosts etc
6123686 many paranormalists claim that their powers only work sometimes or that they dont work if there is a non believer in the room
6123687 were not near ready to put this one to bed yet
6123688 i love you but im not in love with you
6123689 the contest is to get as many votes as we can to not support the two major candidates
6123690 the day before i left home for christmas i started walking my precinct
6123691 it was icy i fell down three times i had bruises all over my legs but i kept going because i believe in his message
6123692 i believe in what he has to offer america as a young person i wasnt just going to sit back and watch it all go by
6123693 but if he puts huckabee on the ticket he gets my money and he gets my physical labor
6123694 if youre willing to laugh at a candidate onstage thats a really deep personal affront
6123695 thats what really made me say im going to open up my wallet and im going to give to this guy because no one laughs at money
6123696 it was a single vehicle crash it looks like the driver lost control and the vehicle ran off the side of the road and rolled
6123697 if he had a seatbelt on he would probably be alive that is quite likely when taking into account the extent of damage to the vehicle
6123698 its our 24th fatality and again he probably would have survived if he was wearing a seatbelt its quite simple
6123699 were only eight months into the year and we have another four months to go
6123700 its quite frightening to look at how were running in a statistical sense
6123701 and we keep on repeatedly saying people are just doing things that are contributing to their death and the death of others they are careless mistakes
6123702 hes missed the point and thinks its a big joke it just goes to show that mr molony has no people skills and has no respect for anybody especially his constituents
6123703 i formally ask that the mayor retract his comments or resign his position
6123704 what i want to know is what do the other councillors really think
6123705 do these people actually back this because their silence says they agree
6123706 i said not really but she kept bugging me and i finally said yes
6123707 i said id drive her over but jessica said keva had said she would pay for a taxi
6123708 i remember the taxi arriving and jessica saying im going now ms campbell said
6123709 she was excited about going to the movies with keva
6123710 youd better bring my daughter home because i know youve f got her my baby im going to ring the f police
6123711 being named to this list for the second straight year is an honor we are so proud to receive
6123712 we always aim for a trifecta with our customers to create a beautiful product that is high in quality and at a price that doesnt offend we think we scored that again this year as even in this uncertain economy our customers have returned to us in spades they see our product as an investment that will last more than one season and most rewarding to me is that our shoes make them feel confident as they step out into an uncertain world
6123713 so it became obvious to us that we needed to reach them in ways that mattered to them our increased online presence and success therein can be directly linked to the fact that we reach them instantly with our newest offerings and the next instant they can purchase them

6123950 i cant say anything for sure without studying them but when you see a group of suicides like that there are often factors that could have contributed
6123951 weve been hearing about everything from people not being given clean clothes filthy conditions and abuse

6124001 wikis allow for real time collaboration on the generation of a document
6124002 blogs and wikis are now becoming mainstream communication tools but who in the department of the navy is actually using them
6124003 its blogs wikis social networking search capabilities it has changed the tenor of communications
6124004 and everybody has a common understanding of whats going on
6124005 its an effective way to communicate with a work force thats distributed around the world
6124006 increasingly dod it managers are creating rss feeds from databases such as an ied attack database or a significant actions database
6124007 initial progress may be slow but will accelerate as barriers to broad based information sharing are overcome
6124008 if you have expertise on a subject you can contribute to a topical page with other experts working that issue in different organizations and immediately youve made a connection with others who you may not have known otherwise
6124009 simulation based training is social interactive adaptable in real time globally distributed collaborative and heavily reliant on digital data it shares many characteristics with the new social media that have been labeled web 2 0

6124015 were walking slowly toward web 2 0 not running because we have to protect the network
6124016 in an ideal world the folks who deal with security in the military would unplug everything from the web theyre most concerned about what they dont know they dont know wheres the information coming from is it false those kinds of checks often dont exist in this arena it makes them nervous
6124017 kids in college today grew up with it its ubiquitous to them they cannot relate to a non internet noncomputer world

6124023 alcohol is certainly something that doesnt help with our recovery coming into these games where were backing up close together and travelling a lot
6124024 the first year it was 2006 the coaching staff they brought it up but said it was entirely up to us whether we wanted to enforce it
6124025 we thought it was a good idea and weve decided to do it again
6124026 were going to be running into some desperate teams teams that are going to be fighting for their lives i suppose
6124027 we certainly dont go into any game not expecting a tough game thats the nature of this competition its very close
6124028 theyre certainly a team that can put points on you and theyve got some dangerous players
6124029 its not a matter of size its a matter of skill

6124034 mark has proven to be an exceptional role model for not only the younger members of our playing group but also our senior players

6124045 he was here for five hours the other day on his day off
6124046 hes manic about it and if anyone deserves it its scott
6124047 the soft tissue and conditioning of his body he needs another game at that level
6124048 i havent thought about it because its no good dancing at shadows but thats what you get paid for thats why youve got the title well make the decision based on the facts at the time
6124049 to most players i would have thought it was an uphill battle for the amount of time given to play games
6124050 but westy is a unique individual he is the toughest competitor ive seen to be able to play under duress and to get the job done

6124052 impossible and frustrating not being able to continue to play and be competitive at the highest level
6124053 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to
6124054 i am also shattered that i cant lead the australian davis cup team in chile in our bid to rejoin the world group and hope that the boys can still come through with a great win

6124111 i was narrowly elected national superintendent at our 1977 national conference i was just 41 years old afterwards the deputy phil hills came up to me and said before we wind up the conference could you set some goals wed never set goals in 40 years of meetings
6124112 wed set goals for overseas missions and the remarkable thing is we always reached them
6124113 phil said what about a growth goal and i said lets do it how much and he said 50 i said okay it seemed impossible so i got up and told the conference were going to suggest that we go for 50 increase and everyone put their hands up and voted and it happened after the conference i began to think how are we going to achieve this i wrote to each of our churches and challenged them to trust god for a certain number of new decisions for christ two years later wed grown by 68

6124146 when youre riding a motorcycle if youre passing by a bakery you can smell the fresh bread being baked on the other hand if youre behind a garbage truck youre going to smell that garbage truck
6124147 but youre out there in the environment up close with the wind blowing in your face on a hot summer day or the cold wind on a cold winter day
6124148 i ride a motorcycle because i enjoy the stress reduction it provides me when riding out on back roads it really enables you to see parts of the country you miss in a car being on a motorcycle requires you to be much more aware of your surroundings enabling you to notice many things on the road that we usually take for granted
6124149 my dad always spoke about that experience with a twinkle in his eye

6124160 we found that red tide toxins can be metabolized by other species of phytoplankton that holds true for both the brevetoxins that damage members of the animal kingdom and the as yet unknown allelopathic toxins that kill other competing species of algae
6124161 it could be that skeletonema is degrading karenias allelopathic chemicals just like it degrades brevetoxins or it could be that skeletonema is stressing karenia out making it harder to produce allelopathic chemicals
6124162 we found that when we took seawater and added purified brevetoxins to it the live algae didnt suffer much so there must be other chemicals released by the red tide that are toxic to these algae
6124163 what we do know is that this diatom s costatum is able to undermine these toxins produced by the red tide as well as the brevetoxins that are known to kill vertebrate animals like fish and dolphins
6124164 i think it does needs to be looked at from the outside i really believe i dont know who did it but its pretty obvious to me it was done to attempt to change the outcome of an election so i think it needs to be looked into
6124165 something needs to be done an investigation needs to be done to clean this up thats for sure
6124166 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
6124167 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
6124168 pacific island countries are saying to the countries of the world including australia including the united states including the europeans including the chinese and the indians that the time for action concrete action over climate change is now
6124169 tuvalu has been crying out about the dire effects of climate change and rising sea levels but nothing concrete nothing tangible has been done to mitigate the problems that they encounter
6124170 there appears to be this concept that climate change is something that is happening out there in the future but it is impacting countries in the region now especially the small island countries
6124171 i am very heartened that the pacific island countries are making their voices heard on the subject of climate change

6124195 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat
6124196 theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend

6124204 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

6124208 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war

6124210 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself

6124234 weve learned that nvidia is working hard to launch gt200 55nm but this will most certainly wont happen in august or september our sources imply that this will take place in q4 2008 nvidia simply wants to win the performance crown back from r700 adding gddr5 memory and 55nm process will certainly speed things up and they will take the dissipation down thermal dissipation is nvidias biggest problem as the chip turns to be extremely hot and the new 55nm should be a bit better once you take care of thermals you can clock the chip higher which eventually means more performance the 55nm process with a new clock and gddr5 memory should get gt200 55nm a bit faster than r700 and this is exactly what nvidia needs

6124238 the right to dignity does not necessarily extend to the right not to be named as a suspect once there is a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed
6124239 that mr zuma is suspected of alleged corruption is the truth it does not signify his guilt his right to be presumed innocent remains untrammelled
6124240 but there is no right not to be named as a suspect
6124241 the applicant has admitted that he had conversations with two judges of the constitutional court about the zuma thint cases his attempt to portray these discussions as a collegial interchange is unsustainable
6124242 elementary principles of judicial ethics preclude a judge of one division to discuss the merits of a matter with judges of the highest court in circumstances where judgement is still pending
6124243 on his own version this is precisely what the applicant did that with respect amounts to gross misconduct
6124244 with a view to the constitutional values of openness and accountability it was considered that the independence of the constitutional court and its deliberative processes would be best protected by a public disclosure of what occurred
6124245 it was felt it was particularly important to reassure the public that the public judges of the court are committed to protecting the integrity of the judicial process and will not even when circumstances may be difficult or hostile shrink from that commitment
6124246 given the sensitivities that have developed around this matter a court would not like any party to be uncomfortable
6124247 let me make it quite clear that i do not crib or plagiarise from mr trengove
6124248 you would be tying the hands of the jsc if your lordships grant it the declaration
6124249 there is nothing that can ever justify the conduct of the constitutional court judges he hlophe had a right to be heard

6124257 in some cases reported in the literature people have infected their pets with mrsa methicillin resistant staph aureus and it has later been transmitted back to the people
6124258 people who tend to have repeat infections that dont seem to be cured with the appropriate treatment may want to have their pet screened to make sure they are not the reservoir for the disease

6124273 we got much needed rain from the storm however there are isolated pockets of standing water that could cause some problems especially in the indian river region where weve had reports of 13 inches of rain despite that situation we came out of this in pretty good shape

6124289 recent developments in nanotechnology have enabled researchers to fabricate nanoparticle chains with great precision and fidelity penns research team took advantage of this technological advance by utilizing metallic nanoparticles as a chain of miniature waveguides that exchange light currently the advance is theoretical but from a practical standpoint the creation of a metallic nanochain would provide the combination of smaller diameter optical components coupled with larger bandwidth making them optimal wave guiding materials as the velocity of the light pulse increases so too does the operating bandwidth of a waveguide increasing the bandwidth helps to increase the number of information channels allowing more information to flow simultaneously through a waveguide
6124290 researchers investigated changing the shape of particles in an attempt to increase this bandwidth spherically shaped nanoparticles the shape used almost exclusively in early research provide narrow bandwidths of light as markel and govyadinov discovered shaping the particles as prolate cigar shaped or oblate saucer shaped spheroids boosted the velocities of surface plasmon pulses reflecting off the surface to 2 5 times the speed of light in a vacuum
6124291 from slow to superluminal propagation dispersive properties of surface plasmon polaritons in linear chains of metallic nanospheroids
6124292 we demonstrate superluminal propagation of gaussian wave packets in numerical simulations both theory and simulations are based on maxwell equations with account of retardation and therefore are fully relativistic

6124295 the impression one gets from corporate critics is that many are prospering but exploiting loopholes in the tax code and leaving the rest of us to pick up the tab but that criticism is based on the mistaken notion that in robust years such as 2005 virtually all businesses do well nothing could be further from the truth even in good times there are plenty of losers in a dynamic economy the bls business dynamics survey for instance shows that in 2005 there were 7 3 businesses that were contracting for every 7 6 that were expanding including 1 3 that were closing their doors for every 1 5 that were starting up large businesses were hardly immune to this kind of tumult for every 5 8 jobs added by firms with more than 500 employees other firms that big eliminated 4 9 jobs among those hit hard in 2005 was general motors which despite 193 billion in revenues wracked up a 10 4 billion loss and cut its workforce it shouldnt be necessary to remind reporters and editors who cover such matters that businesses pay taxes on their profits not sales

6124301 we are not forgetting the fact that we have played some good one day cricket this year
6124302 we just need to find the level of performance that saw us beat the likes of durham lancashire and northamptonshire earlier in the season more consistently
6124303 yorkshire are a dangerous side with international players right through the team so it will be a tough match but we all believe we can win
6124304 they have beaten us in limited overs cricket twice already this season but we enjoyed a great win at headingley carnegie in the twenty20 cup and we had them in trouble at 59 for four before rain spoiled things at the county ground back in may

6124441 baa should be broken up so that it no longer has such a dominant hold over airport capacity in london and the south east they have let down their passengers by providing poor service and heathrow hassle is now notorious
6124442 breaking up the baa monopoly is a long overdue move to make aviation fairer to passengers
6124443 the next step is to end the hidden public subsidy to the aviation industry to make air travel fair to the environment as well
6124444 lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
6124445 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
6124446 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
6124447 in scotland the commission has apparently ignored the evidence presented by baa and supported by numerous respected third party organisations that clearly demonstrates that serve separate markets and therefore do not and would not compete regardless of ownership

6124815 its a very harmonic picture and as a whole its very balanced the orange and pink ball shape above your head is typical for people who meditate youre a spiritual seeker and youre very affable and have a humble way of approaching people you have lots of compassion and empathy the thin and delicate light that shines through you shows your ability to understand other people and where they are in life the blue colour where your arms are reveal your creative power theres a complete balance and you use the artist and the scientist inside you to the inexperienced eye there are no colour to the sides but when i hold the picture in the light theres a light violet shade that shows that youre worrying about how to combine your belief with what you actually do in life you would like to combine these two things with the gifts you receive from a higher conscience
6124816 im a believer of the dark and the light and see no limits in between the power i believe in comes in different shapes
6124817 your picture has a very balanced shape you have a lot of things happening in your life right now a lot of artistic stuff the red indicates a lot of physical activities your body loves to move and its a tool for your power but the red also indicates suppressed anger and passion the green colour symbolizes the heart chakra and also that youre going through a period of change the yellow above your head is the intellect and the orange between the yellow shows that you have healing powers on your right side theres a bit of blue and that demonstrates that theres a lot of focus on your creative side as an artist
6124818 i believe in trinity but jesus is the central figure jesus is the road and the only way to salvation

6124852 the state is home to 640 public authorities and ineffective economic development initiatives
6124853 if elected i promise to question the economic necessity of these programs and many others and fight for the repeal of the state gas tax

6124859 i do think it the law is a good idea

6124865 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
6124866 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
6124867 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
6124868 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs hardball echoing comments he made earlier in the day at an event promoting his book at the national press club
6124869 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
6124870 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
6124871 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
6124872 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
6124873 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
6124874 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
6124875 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
6124876 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
6124877 sen obama said he would do everything possible to end the war in iraq and emphasized the need for a political solution yet he failed to show up to vote for sen bidens critical amendment to provide a political solution in iraq
6124878 frankly i think im more qualified than other candidates and the issues facing the american public are all in my wheelbarrow

6124884 shares of amylin pharmaceuticals fell 5 59 or 16 3 percent to 28 62 in afternoon trading while indianapolis based eli lilly dipped 80 cents to 47 98
6124885 as long as i am feeling okay and doing justice to myself and the team i will keep going
6124886 what else is there to do on a saturday afternoon certainly nothing as good as playing football
6124887 its a sacrifice i am quite prepared to make to keep playing at this level
6124888 im not as quick as i used to be and i probably read the game a bit better so sub consciously i have probably changed
6124889 but theres no special secret to keeping on going fortunately i am naturally quite fit and really its just the love of the game
6124890 i have been fortunate to be popular which makes it a bit easier if youre having a bad time
6124891 i have not been the best footballer on the books but people have seen that i have always given everything and i think they appreciate that
6124892 when you start out you want to make a go of it
6124893 you look a bit to the future but not as far as i have managed to keep playing
6124894 to still be playing at this level is a great feeling and when you score it still feels just like the first time
6124895 that was the idea to get promoted to the conference
6124896 i wanted to keep playing at as a high level as i can and to go up was just brilliant
6124897 its tough playing against full time teams when you train just twice a week but we work for each other and work well as a unit
6124898 we only stayed up on the last day last season but at worst that was the position we were aiming for and we got there
6124899 i think we were the only part time team to stay up altrincham also survived thanks to bostons double demotion and we will be looking to build on that this season and kick on
6124900 the lads that are still here know what its about now and are a bit more aware of whats required
6124901 they look up to me in one sentence and then in the next they are dragging me down you know what its like in football and i wouldnt want to be treated any different
6124902 some of the young lads come and ask for me for a bit of advice and im always willing to help them with a few points in training and try and guide them
6124903 if they are getting frustrated at not getting opportunities or at what theyre achieving i tell them they have plenty of time and to keep working at it
6124904 they are the type of players i wanted and there are another couple im talking to
6124905 we are really excited it is the first time a premiership team has been to marston road
6124906 were aware its going to be a massive test for us

6125233 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6125234 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6125235 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

6125238 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging

6125245 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
6125246 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful

6125251 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years

6125253 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
6125254 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
6125255 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
6125256 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
6125257 i think the financial problem is half way through the cycle theres another shoe to drop ahead of us and it could be more severe

6125264 jag tror att han har g tt f r l ngt och att det har blivit f r kr ngligt det kanske r s att han har lyssnat f r mycket p skatteverket och deras egen utredning skatteverket l gger ju naturligtvis ribban efter sin erfarenhet och efter sin v rld
6125265 danmark inf rde ju ett s dant h r system f r n gra r sedan som ocks var v ldigt tajt men de har ju f tt backa p det d rf r att i praktiken fungerar det inte

6125294 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6125295 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6125296 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6125297 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away

6125308 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6125309 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6125310 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6125311 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6125312 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6125313 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6125314 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6125315 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6125316 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6125317 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6125318 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6125319 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
6125320 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
6125321 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
6125322 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6125323 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6125324 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
6125325 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
6125326 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
6125327 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
6125328 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
6125329 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
6125330 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6125331 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6125332 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6125333 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6125334 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6125335 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6125336 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6125337 pay any price bear any burden in the defense of liberty
6125338 cooking with biofuels such as wood dung and crop residue
6125339 open biomass burning associated with deforestation and crop residue burning
6125340 soot and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the current our italics global warming effect of carbon dioxide
6125341 black carbon particles only remain airborne for weeks at most compared to carbon dioxide which remains in the atmosphere for more than a century
6125342 over 400 000 annual fatalities among women and children are attributed to smoke inhalation during indoor cooking

6125346 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6125347 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6125348 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6125349 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
6125350 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
6125351 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
6125352 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
6125353 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6125354 they told me there are going to be resources here
6125355 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6125356 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6125357 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6125358 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6125359 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6125360 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6125361 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6125362 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6125363 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6125364 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6125365 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6125366 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6125367 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6125368 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6125369 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6125370 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
6125371 it is extremely childish for a 33 year old man to be picking on a 19 year old girl you should be ashamed of yourself
6125372 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6125373 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6125374 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6125375 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6125376 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6125377 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6125378 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6125379 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6125380 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6125381 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6125382 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6125383 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6125384 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6125385 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6125386 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6125387 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6125388 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6125389 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6125390 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6125391 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6125392 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6125393 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6125394 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6125395 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6125396 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6125397 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6125398 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6125399 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6125400 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6125401 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6125402 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6125403 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6125404 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6125405 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6125406 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6125407 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6125408 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6125409 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6125410 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
6125411 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
6125412 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
6125413 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
6125414 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
6125415 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6125416 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6125417 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6125418 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6125419 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6125420 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6125421 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6125422 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
6125423 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6125424 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6125425 nixon was bad enough without fictionalizing him and demonizing him
6125426 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
6125427 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6125428 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6125429 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6125430 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6125431 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6125432 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6125433 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6125434 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6125435 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6125436 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6125437 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6125438 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6125439 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6125440 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6125441 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6125442 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
6125443 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
6125444 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6125445 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6125446 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6125447 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6125448 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6125449 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6125450 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6125451 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6125452 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6125453 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6125454 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6125455 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6125456 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6125457 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6125458 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6125459 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6125460 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6125461 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6125462 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6125463 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6125464 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6125465 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6125466 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6125467 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified

6125506 hur ofta b r jag unders ka mina f delsem rken
6125507 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6125508 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6125509 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6125510 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
6125511 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6125512 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
6125513 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone
6125514 it is good to be here with adam schiff he is not a partisan hack he is a dedicated legislator i have worked with him on anti gang activity and on anti nuclear proliferation issues
6125515 with regards to debating i prefer more light than heat
6125516 the rise of jewish republicanism is real and it is frustrating to jewish democrats
6125517 concerns with obama run deep with regards to foreign policy israel and combatting islamofacism
6125518 islamofacism has been around for 1400 years jews were dhimmis under islamofacism during the middle ages and women were and still are being mistreated after 1400 years of islam jews and women are still not equal even in america on college campuses students can take classes in sharia law finance
6125519 there are two main distinctions between the parties the first distinction is that it is the republican party that is pushing to get us off of foreign oil we can drill where it is safe where tourists will not be affected congress is off right now and they should be in washington
6125520 the second distinction is with economics some of my best relatives are still democrats yet entitlement reform is vital 15 3 cents of every dollar is stolen out of your paycheck the government does a lousy job with your money social security medicare and medicaid make up 60 of the deficit these costs have to be reined in the democrats smeared such reforms as investing in enron we need personal savings accounts
6125521 the gop agenda is a liberty agenda we are not the party of taxes or the mommy state in sacramento the american dream and the dream of protecting our security interests is still alive in the gop
6125522 things will not get nasty tonight although the crowd needs to know that larry went to cal and i went to stanford
6125523 i am adam i am married to eve but my children are not cain and abel we were going to name one of them noah but thought that that might be too much
6125524 i am not the adam schiff from the television show law and order
6125525 get involved in whatever campaign you choose while i hope you will support obama get involved regardless of which candidate you support
6125526 i am from boston and i grew up believing in the kennedy era tradition that public service is a noble calling my wife and i took our children and walked south carolina precincts for obama young people are seen as apathetic but not this time
6125527 the public is weary after eight years of president bush in other nations running against the united staes is a good campaign strategy
6125528 electing obama would be a catalytic event only a nation like america can do this
6125529 we need help from other nations it is tough to get helped when the usa is so disliked
6125530 obamas election would have an effect on how we view ourselves
6125531 look for the candidate who can unite us todays problems are not worse than world war ii or the cold war but we are less united
6125532 there are two very good people running for president they are men of integrity with compelling personal stories primaries are said to often winnow out the best candidates in this case the primaries winnowed in the two best people
6125533 mccain is an honest man but he is no longer a maverick he has adopted the positions of the republicans and president bush he will keep to the pledges he is making now
6125534 the issue of energy crosses all lines it is a security issue a foreign policy issue an economic issue and an agricultural issue obama is not tied to the oil crowd
6125535 mccain is a unifier he has reached across the aisle he fights earmarks obama secured an earmark for his wifes company obama is not a candidate of hope or change he is not a unifier or problem solver
6125536 democrats are making our allies nervous on trade they talk about repealing nafta they are upsetting columbia their protectionism talk is worrying the world
6125537 right now our relations with japan india and south korea are high germany france italy mexico and canada all have center right governments that are pro american in london red ken livingstone has been kicked out of office in australia there was a pro american government for a long time even when that government changed the new government is equally pro american
6125538 the world does not hate us the worlds left hates us
6125539 the world likes obamas evenhanded neutral approach towards israel european leftists the bbc and intellectuals want israel thrown overboard president bush wont do this
6125540 this is not your fathers democratic party of fdr jfk and scoop jackson joseph lieberman was kicked out of the party the moveon org takeover of the democratic party worries many jewish democrats we would go far to the left on foreign policy
6125541 we produce 3 of the worlds oil we make up 25 of world demand no amount of drilling could change this the oil companies already have 68 million leased acres they should drill there instead of asking for new leases the oil from anwr would supplu us for about 6 months
6125542 on israel obama has an a record with aipac he worked on divestment from iran
6125543 we need to take the profits out of the petro industry so that we ar enot sending money to nations such as russia and venezuela
6125544 under this administration we have built up deficits we have cut taxes but not spending we should give tax credits to wind and solar companies instead of oil companies they have the largest profits of any industry mccain wants to continue giving tax cuts to the wealthy
6125545 demagoguery regarding anwr is completely wrong anwr is frozen tundra not the setting described in a hallmark card one mile from here we are drilling by beverly hills high school it provides one million barrels the arab middle east is still only prodicing 30 million barrels there is a dliberate supply restriction
6125546 the lethargy of the auto industry has come at a trrible price weve lost jobs while there are waiting lists for priuses the automakers went kicking and screaming into the 21st century the gops primary focus is on drilling whats good for big business is good for america
6125547 i am from the tom friedman school when he says that this is insane policy
6125548 obama worked with the gop to pass ethics reform he supports campaign finance reform he worked with dick lugar on anti nuclear proliferation he wants to stop the spread of loose nukes in russia
6125549 obama is trying to run a positive and bipartisan campaign
6125550 in 1956 dwight eisenhower won 40 of the jewish vote with ronald reagan picking up a third of that vote in 1984 given that those numbers are lower today how can jews be for the gop
6125551 when asked if they support a close relationship between the usa and israel 90 of republican say yes only 50 of democrats say yes jews fit well within the party of lincoln
6125552 some jews think they ar evoting for fdrs 20th consecutive term the myths of fdr cn be disspelled another night he turned back the jews carter called khomeini a prince
6125553 jewish gop support has gone from 24 in 2004 to 28 today a 4 increase within the margin of error there have been scurrilous rumors about obama my dad is part of the boca raton jewish mafia he hears them
6125554 obama has said that jerusalem should be undivided obama is attacke dby his associations jimmy carter has nothing to do with this
6125555 the democratic party does not feel entitled we hav ethe spirit of tikkun olam not the gop we must give back this is not about ourselves
6125556 he is against the securtiy fence he talks of no walls between peoples in the real world not the john lennon world with no religions or walls we need security
6125557 he cites jfks meeting with kruschev which was a disaster he cites reagan meeting with gorbachev which came only after reagan called them an evil empire and had missiles pointed at them
6125558 obamas advisers were against the september 6th 2007 israeli strike against syria among obamas anti israel advisers are david bonior and chuck hagel
6125559 i was at the aipac conference with an undivided jerusalem obama backtracked the next day
6125560 does obama hate jews no dos he play political games yes aipac gives everyone a good rating
6125561 mccain would be disappointed in the attacks and smears against obama much of what larry said has already been debunked boniors connection to the campaign was fighting for the michigan delegation for obama over hillary
6125562 obamas vote against kyl lieberman was due to a provision regarding troop levels in iraq
6125563 obama favors the ame level of diplomatic engagement wih iran not mccain
6125564 president bushs actions have not been helpful for israel they were helpful for iran his actions allowed north korea to get bombs and strengthened hamas mccain is the same as president bush on iran iran will develop the bomb if we dont change our strategy iran cannot get the bomb
6125565 the question is what are the real term implications it was president bush that said no to dealing with yassir arafat
6125566 obama surrounds himself with people like robert malley and samantha power obama has said that iran is not as serious as nazism or communism
6125567 we tried diplomacy with iran russia and china blocked sanctions iran is a regime of terror negotiation gives them time to develop weapons
6125568 the situation with russia and georgia is another problem obama does not carry a big stick yet people can calm down mccain has 30 years of experience
6125569 malley as an adviser has been debunked as a means of guilt by association
6125570 this falsification is disturbing obama never said that iran was no big deal he favors muscular diplomacy there is promise in iran among the young people who like us nd not the regime this is the reverse of saudi arabia where the regime likes us but the people dont
6125571 president bush said that he looked into the soul of vladiir putin and saw great things the president was impotent on georgia the presidents reaction had no effect on russia he had to go albania to find a place where he was popular
6125572 today we wrapped up a diplomatic success in poland we placed missile interceptors there poland and libya have been diplomatic successes
6125573 what will make the next administration more effective than the last 8 years
6125574 look at the primary turnout young peope are actually turning out the president promised to be a uniter and change the tone the tone today is worse obama has the potential to bring the country together
6125575 a mccain administration would be an intra mccain battle for the soul of the mccain presidency if he announced he is only serving one term then he is a lame duck after two years there will be warfare within the gop
6125576 we must be talking about different parties not different planets the democrats are still warring and might be at thier convention
6125577 we were unified after 9 11 democrats decided to try and destroy president bush when the going got tough
6125578 kerry reid murtha and durbin smeared our troops the new york times blew up our covert surveillance the moveon left as well as the daily kos have been bush bashing for 7 years in addition to their antisemitism the left has destroyed civilized debate they keep trying to silence conservatives through the fairness doctrine and union tactics obama is a partisan hack mccain builds bridges
6125579 conservative talk radio is bad for the discourse in the united states
6125580 if jews had guns during the holocaust there would have been a lot more dead nazis mccain is pro second amendment
6125581 obama backs moderate second amendment support he supported the fisa bill
6125582 mccain supported breyer and ginsburg obama was not highly generous regarding dignified people such as roberts alito and bolton who is a hero to jewish people
6125583 bolton is irrelevant wit regards to abortion obama supports choice mccain has been consistently anti choice
6125584 obama believes in a phase down of the troops ive been to iraq 4 times there has been progress but not politically
6125585 obama is criticized for for bringing up unilateral action regarding pakistan we need to draw down troops so iraqis can make progress without using us as a buffer
6125586 mccain was the author of the surge no withdrawal until the job is done
6125587 go to the website for investors business daily obama voted for tax increases 94 times he wants to raise taxes on those making 42 000 or more tax cuts worked jfl and reagan understood this
6125588 the united nations is a group of dictators obama supports the u n
6125589 we need to empower entrepreneurs paying 50 60 in taxes is enough obama disagrees
6125590 one worldism is is conservative talk radio stuff to make obama seem new agey he does not want to turn over u s sovereignty to the u n
6125591 obama is only raising taxes on those making more than 250 000 per year mccain is not knowledgeable on the economy
6125592 too little regulatory oversight led to the economic problems we have today oil companies are not paying enough taxes
6125593 make foreign aid tied to better performance not by the u n the u n fails at everything
6125594 this election is the american hero vs the american idol we are told not to engage in guily by association but an administration is comprised of the associates
6125595 democrats want to silence the debate through the fairness doctrine and check cards for unions
6125596 mccain has been smeared by wesley clark and by anti israel jim webb
6125597 there are thousands of stories of mccain they are stories of service sacrifice resoluteness and bipartisanship
6125598 mccain has a copelling story he is a hero yet how will mccain handle the economy and foreign policy what about universal health care
6125599 robert malley is an anti semite but he has no ties to obama
6125600 both mccain and obama are men of integirty attacking obama is personally beneath us
6125601 i was the poster child in congress for mccain feingold
6125602 mccain went negative in this election because the gop cant sell mccain without tearing down obama
6125603 mccain should run on his record but he is not the man for this hour
6125604 had no choice but to enter into the settlement in order to avoid further incarceration
6125605 jimmy bond had a big jet boat chase in live and let die
6125606 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
6125607 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act

6125619 the farc made themselves into criminals a long time ago
6125620 we are simply tired of this i e farcs violence
6125621 we have in fact put considerable emphasis on how al qaeda in iraq generates resources and they do it again like a mafia does that we would be familiar with its through extortion of successful businesses extortion of money for protection rackets or what have you insisting that a cell phone business for example give them a cut of their profits or theyll blow the cell phones down cell phone towers down taking a cut out of the cement business the real estate business the financial businesses and so forth
6125622 their extortion campaign demanding that businesses pay protection money to avoid being attacked
6125623 to control cell phone use has quickly evolved into just another extortion campaign
6125624 the cell phone service in order to stay in touch with friends family and the few government services that are available
6125625 demanded that night service be restored it was but then noting that there were several cell phone companies operating in southern afghanistan the taliban went to the different companies and offered not only protection but damage to a competitor for a price

6125631 sobre la manera de algunas autoridades departamentales que quieren que se quiebre la institucionalidad en el nombramiento de nuestros mandos queremos ser enf ticos para recalcar que la polic a nacional tiene como base de su actuar a la constituci n pol tica del estado y a la ley org nica de la polic a nacional y las leyes de la rep blica

6125633 we are pleased to provide our customers with the unprecedented ability to stay connected to their family friends and business associates on the ground via the internet while traveling at 30 000 feet above the united states
6125634 mark robinson doesnt find any evidence of it on his first pass at arbortexts books then we fax him our evidence of it then he finds one example mro was it always there and he missed it or did arbortext stick it in there so he could trivialize our evidence like theyve got two sets of books
6125635 i dont know its a red herring what he said about it is pretty ridiculous too where is his audit i need to read it again
6125636 e catalog a k a intermarket as well as the arbortext site license and the arbortext site license maintenance relate to arbortexts august 2000 application development amp software license agreement with mro com wp 10 arbortext was developing a product called content manager by extending the functionality of arbortext programs and integrating them with mros intermat product soon after the agreement and some licensing of software to mro in september 2000 the joint development effort was abandoned the total revenue that arbortext received that was related to e catalog and site license was obtained from mro com refer to exhibit d for amounts
6125637 he admits there is an e catalog intermarket just like zoltan gombosi says on his resume but he shrinks all the other evidence of intermarket thats all over the web and the 4 000 000 gombosi mentions this product hauled in and explains it all by this one and only one contract with mro is that preposterous or what
6125638 thats the word jim sterken used when we first complained about missing sales right before a whole year of them magically turned up in their records
6125639 robinson also doesnt mention that karen sharplin initially said that e catalog and intermarket were never developed and never sold which was a lie and he knows it
6125640 this audit gets worse every time i look at it robinson is bending over backwards to cover up this whole thing his report never mentioned the clear and convincing evidence we gave him regarding this product it was one of the main things we stressed to him and he never addressed it worse he tries to erase it
6125641 i bet kessler international wouldnt come back with some lame ass report like that its total bullshit
6125642 thats why peralta wouldnt let kessler come in for the audit kessler would actually do one
6125643 if dick blair had simply done his job which the judge told him to do peralta could never have kept kessler out this whole nightmare is directly dick blairs fault so what are we going to do about arbortext now
6125644 ive got a call into claudia well see what she advises
6125645 there has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the nixon tapes and the pentagon papers

6125808 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6125809 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6125810 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6125811 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings

6125816 she has always prided herself on her independence and my main worry is that this will take that away from her
6125817 this was a shocking attack on a vulnerable old woman who was walking home from the post office
6125818 we believe he targeted his victim following her from the post office to the alleyway
6125819 to attack a defenceless pensioner like this is pathetic however this man is clearly dangerous and needs to be caught

6125829 lenin defend a la unidad de los pueblos del antiguo imperio zarista pero ten a que ser una unidad voluntaria por eso insisti desde el principio en el derecho a la autodeterminaci n esta idea frecuentemente se malinterpreta como una exigencia de separaci n pero eso es totalmente incorrecto los bolcheviques no estaban a favor de la separaci n pero defend an la extensi n m s amplia posible del derecho a la autodeterminaci n hasta e incluyendo la separaci n nadie tiene el derecho a obligar a un pueblo a vivir dentro de los confines de un estado cuando la mayor a no lo desea pero el derecho de autodeterminaci n no implica la reivindicaci n de la separaci n de la misma manera que el derecho al divorcio no significa que todas las parejas tengan que separarse o que el derecho al aborto no significa que haya que poner fin a todos los embarazos
6125830 el derecho de autodeterminaci n era una parte importante del programa de lenin en la medida en que demostraba claramente a los obreros y campesinos especialmente a stos oprimidos de polonia georgia letonia y ucrania que los obreros rusos no ten an ning n inter s en oprimirles y que defender an firmemente su derecho a decidir su propio destino pero esto s lo era la mitad del programa de lenin sobre la cuesti n nacional la otra mitad era igualmente importante la necesidad de mantener la uni n del proletariado por encima de todas las diferencias nacionales ling sticas o religiosas por lo que se refiere al partido bolchevique lenin siempre se opuso a cualquier tendencia a dividir el partido y el movimiento obrero en general por nacionalidades
6125831 despu s de la revoluci n lenin pensaba que podr a haber una uni n fraternal y voluntaria de los pueblos del antiguo imperio zarista en forma de una federaci n sovi tica

6125914 the long term consequences of child maltreatment are very real and concerning all children should have safe stable and nurturing environments in which to grow and develop for children and adults to live to their full potential we must support programs that stop child maltreatment before it ever begins and work to help those who have already experienced it

6125986 unfortunately no single player can meet our complete requirement so we will have to select an infrastructure provider circle wise
6125987 the themes of vulnerability and humor have always made a significant statement in my paintings books and animation projects our foibles accidents and embarrassments are often the stuff for humorous stories but of course not everything is funny what we are doing to this beautiful life supporting planet is not funny the media manipulating our thoughts with fear is not funny
6125988 the probes concept was born out of necessity a need to find and create a shift of consciousness an antidote for the fear and anxiety propagated by the media and world events everything and everyone was being politicized and polarized and i was losing my sense of humor
6125989 the probes came to me as a life saver thrown as i was drowning in the mental pollution that was flooding my brain was it possible in these highly charged times to transcend the machinations of intellect and look at life again through the eyes of an innocent child well no innocence was lost long ago but what if the world was examined as if it was a really big zoo we watch wildlife nature specials where animals kill each other have sex in sometimes strange ways raise families even eat their children and we feel somewhat comfortable in the knowledge we are witnessing true animal nature
6125990 ah but we too are animals we are nature we are aliens temporary visitors trying to make sense of our existence but sometimes we need help and so i believe a couple of spacemen checking out what weve done here could be just the ticket it could be funny contemplative disturbing and even refreshing like a martini
6125991 these aliens from space are like our children who are also recently arrived aliens who stare in wonder at the world unburdened by preconditioning or context nothing will escape their probing eyes to these spacemen there are no borders no taboos no religion or political agendas they will examine the beauty the cruelty the strangeness the wonders of every nook and cranny of our lives theres no time to tidy up the visitors have arrived

6126000 is barack obama exaggerating when he compares his campaign to the great progressive moments in us history
6126001 obama has run a brilliant campaign but not necessarily a great progressive one but thats not to say his campaign isnt significant or important
6126002 let me just state the obvious electing a black president will be historic and i guess quasi progressive but the substance of what his presidency will be for america just isnt known yet
6126003 i find the question impossible to answer how can we possibly know at this point what obamas campaign means i certainly hope he is successful but i dont want to predict what his achievements will be
6126004 it may not be a movement but obamas campaign is at the very least movement
6126005 his nearness to the presidency is an amazing wondrous thing but america wont be much different afterward blasphemous as that sounds
6126006 in short whether this is an important historical moment or just another election is up to barack obama
6126007 the real fault is not obamas but ours we have forgotten the kind of risk and work it takes to build transformative mass movements and so settle for iconography instead that said hed better win
6126008 pronouncements by prominent persons who are received de facto as representatives of a group can enter into the public vernacular and become part of our unexamined political vocabulary
6126009 barack obamas election would be about as significant to us history as jackie robinsons appearance at second base was for the brooklyn dodgers

6126019 quem pode reivindicar um direito a receber o corpo de cristo tudo um ato sem medida do amor de deus nosso senhor se faz ele mesmo dispon vel em seu corpo e em seu sangue mas n o podemos dizer jamais que temos o direito de receb lo na santa comunh o cada vez que nos aproximamos dele devemos faz lo com uma profunda consci ncia de nossa indignidade
6126020 receber indignamente o corpo e o sangue de cristo um sacril gio se o fizer deliberadamente em pecado mortal um sacril gio
6126021 se tivermos um pecado mortal na consci ncia devemos primeiro nos confessar desse pecado e receber a absolvi o e s depois nos aproximar do sacramento eucar stico
6126022 funcion rio p blico que com conhecimento e consentimento sustenta a es que est o contra a lei moral divina e eterna por exemplo apoiar publicamente o aborto procurado que comporta a supress o de vidas humanas inocentes e indefesas uma pessoa que comete pecado desta maneira deve ser admoestada publicamente de modo que n o receba a comunh o at que n o tenha reformado a pr pria vida
6126023 se uma pessoa que foi admoestada persiste em um pecado mortal p blico e se aproxima de receber a comunh o o ministro da eucaristia tem a obriga o de negar lhe a mesma por que sobre tudo pela salva o da pr pria pessoa lhe impedindo de realizar um sacril gio
6126024 em primeiro lugar um esc ndalo referente a nossa disposi o para receber a santa comunh o
6126025 deve se evitar que a gente seja induzida a pensar que se pode estar em estado de pecado mortal e aproximar se da eucaristia
6126026 se tivermos uma figura p blica que aberta e deliberadamente sustenta os direitos abortistas e que recebe a eucaristia o que terminar pensando a gente comum pode chegar a acreditar que correto at certo ponto suprimir uma vida inocente no seio materno
6126027 n o tem nenhuma inten o de interferir na vida p blica mas no estado espiritual do pol tico ou do funcion rio p blico que se for cat lico deve seguir a lei divina tamb m na esfera p blica
6126028 portanto simplesmente rid culo e errado tratar de silenciar a um pastor acusando o de interferir em pol tica para que n o possa fazer o bem alma de um membro de sua grei

6126031 we believe you can develop the resource while protecting the environment
6126032 because sustainable was an ambiguous term and because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oilsands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that on this point the ad was misleading
6126033 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise is wholly misleading
6126034 which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs

6126063 jinzhu was believed to be male owing to her inconspicuous secondary sex characteristic and behavior
6126064 im sure those people will say ok i have to do the liberty bell independence hall cheesesteaks the rocky statue and the comcast screen
6126065 its just amazing how many people come flocking to this thing with smiles on their faces
6126066 to capture the 20 second audience in transit and get a smile on their face is unbelievably rewarding
6126067 we went for this because we wanted to create something that would be very high technology in our building that would communicate the high technology business that were in
6126068 when you go into lots of media companies very often you see televisions in their lobbies big screens with network content on it we thought that we wanted to do something more sophisticated than that
6126069 and now there are thousands of people coming in to see the wall shop to visit the cafe fountain or just hang around
6126070 theres a certain thing that people would expect to see up on a screen like that
6126071 and weve gone to great lengths to create the unexpected
6126072 this is by far the most exciting cast we have in over 13 years of shooting live action movies for command amp conquer
6126073 the caliber of the performances we received both individually and collectively have really raised the storytelling bar for the franchise we are really excited that we will be delivering such a high quality production that is on par with movies and television shows
6126074 i wasnt sure what to expect when i came in to work on a video game
6126075 what i realized is red alert 3 is not just a video game its absolutely an interactive movie this is where the people at home get to move the story forward and where seeing the plot thicken is a reward for a job well done and thats really cool
6126076 i think video games are one of the new frontiers for actors and using live action is just another way to connect more easily to the gamer rather than cg or animation techniques
6126077 to be in a groundbreaking game like red alert 3 where we are using full on shooting of live actors and to be with jonathan pryce tim curry and peter stormare it was a great opportunity for a character actor like me to have some fun
6126078 it delayed a lot of folks getting to where they had to go yesterday
6126079 already i have had people come up to me in cafes and say hey youre james franco right hey i cant get a hold of my guy do you know where i can buy some good weed even in class at ucla ive had someone come up to me and be hey whats up man and give me a handshake and palm me a little bag of weed
6126080 actually its more than mom and pop because all our friends give us apples and plums and wild grapes
6126081 and maybe a sparkling white zin but i have to test it to see if it actually sparkles
6126082 my husband olaf gave me a winemaking kit for christmas in 2004
6126083 i was excited because i wanted to learn and intrigued that you could make your own wine that actually tastes good and its fairly easy i started making fruit wines and then grape wines
6126084 a guy in the twin cities who i only know as jerry the juiceman
6126085 i had to ask around learn how to make a simple syrup to get it right i was surprised at how well it turned out
6126086 last year we had a bonfire and drank it there with friends and it was terrible just terrible
6126087 we still entered them at the anoka county fair and i thought theyd put mr yuck stickers on them but they loved them sometimes it takes a good year to year and a half to know whether a fruit wine will be really good it can just turn overnight
6126088 you have to test it and you have to be cautious with sugar because you cant undo that if too much is added at any point
6126089 sometimes you have to wait a couple of years especially with grape wines
6126090 you can pick wild blackberries and wild raspberries forever and then go oh my i have 12 pounds to go
6126091 but the most labor intensive one was a dandelion wine because you pick and pick and pick its backbreaking work i get sore just thinking about it

6126099 it was a positive meeting and frank coach santana asked whether i can commit to being available throughout the remainder of the 2010 african nations cup qualifiers and to all games that i am called up to honour i told the coach i will be available because i love my country and i want to show that in every game i play just like last night tuesday
6126100 we have to be positive the way we played against a good team like australia showed we have the talent and direction what we need now is the enthusiasm of the people of south africa
6126101 sas is doing everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities
6126102 spanair is doing everything possible to assist the spanish authorities at this difficult time
6126103 members are advised that the official opening of the first session of the 7th parliament by his excellency mugabe will take place on tuesday 26 august
6126104 in the present case the mdc has not consented to the convening of the parliament
6126105 typhoon karen is expected to enhance the southwest monsoon and bring rains over luzon especially in the western section and western visayas which may trigger flashfloods and landslides
6126106 when you put more police on the streets when you have specific initiatives designed to go after specific types of offences those are two of many circumstances that result in increased numbers
6126107 at one time you would never hear of a robbery a daylight robbery at a bank was unheard of
6126108 now nobody gets too excited about it knocking off a macs milk store thats more common today than it was years ago
6126109 people do move here to get away from the city because they feel when theyre in the city youve got more violence more crimes and more of a chance of getting hurt
6126110 times have changed and were trying to keep up with them
6126111 it challenges the myth that cities are violent and rural areas are not
6126112 in huron county they were totally outraged because the people were such fine upstanding citizens they didnt deserve a death like that
6126113 people feel like theyve really been intruded upon because its not the way of life up here
6126114 its really a country feeling we have people come here because they want out of the rat race and a slower pace
6126115 its almost like an arms war at one point in time a good old fashioned fist fight may have been the way differences were sorted out
6126116 the increase in violence goes hand in hand with the need to arm oneself to have the advantage if you want to have the upper hand you go with the biggest gun guns are in the hands of young people and thats because they are actively seeking them
6126117 all kinds of crime is going on but it only becomes officially crime when police charge someone
6126118 it does depend upon the focus of police with weapons charges it might relate to a concentrated focus of police activity
6126119 instead what were seeing is a steady trend line up
6126120 what weve done is moved the crime up along various highways out of the gta and weve moved it into some of these communities where theyve never heard of anybody being arrested with a gun now its routine its had a devastating impact
6126121 we need a guns and gangs initiative thats pan provincial that really understands that handgun and gang activity is as dangerous in small town and rural ontario as it is in toronto
6126122 i have been a successful businessman in my life i have had the porsche had the gold rolex watch and a home in chelsea now all i want to do is help the community
6126123 i know the jury and i and anyone else listening to this case would have been appalled at the cavalier way in which the taxpayers money was dealt with by the kensington and chelsea primary care trust and the positively amateurish way in which the finance department failed to have any sufficient checks on the money it was paying out on the no smoking service
6126124 vague body of the threshold resident association which effectively had no officers no minutes no meetings without any checks whatsoever is an extraordinary derogation of duty and responsibility by the primary care trust

6126141 i hate when youve had on a bra all day long and you just cant wait to take it off every woman has experienced that
6126142 a lot of lingerie tends to leave those marks and be uncomfortable this line is about detail fit and comfort as well as beauty and making women feel sexy
6126143 in order for me to do something i have to be very passionate about it or i wont give it my all

6126146 its justice case files described as a series of illustrated novels designed to educate the public about how us courts work how judges make decisions and how courts are accountable to the law

6126157 i think hes been a victim of a board thats come in given him a lot of money and wanted success immediately
6126158 time stood still for us for a year because everyone we tried to bring in in terms of knowledge and experience was injured thats not his fault
6126159 i think hes got to be judged on what happens from now you cant just buy success in one season it takes time
6126160 somebodys got to be the favourite to get the sack first and unfortunately its him because of the demand at west ham for success
6126161 but the odds on him going will soon change if we stick two or three quick wins together
6126162 theres a determination to go where we wanted to go last season before it went wrong
6126163 you want your biggest weapons out there because you know at any stage of the game kieron dyer or craig bellamys pace could get you a goal
6126164 i think theres been less activity in the market this summer because were yet to see our transfers from last year play their part
6126165 having them back alongside dean ashton and scott parker will be like new signings
6126166 were delighted with what weve done over the summer and we think the squad is stronger
6126167 we finished the season off fantastically well the fans have got bigger expectations and rightly so
6126168 i applaud governor for leadership on this issue and so many others that we have seen over the last four months
6126169 i believe with the governors leadership we have made a good foundation today

6126211 irelands worst air disaster occurred early this morning when a small two mark twain
6126212 the us and india are certainly using strong arms tactics but reports that a decision on the proposal could occur this week dont appear to match with the reality that many states of the 45 member nsg group still have significant concerns
6126213 the us germany and india are privately acknowledging that a second or third meeting will likely be convened sometime in september on the issue and that changes to the us august 6 proposed text will be necessary to achieve nsg consensus
6126214 perhaps in recognition of many difficulties the proposal faces in the nsg germany has reportedly invited india to present its case and answer questions from nsg countries at this weeks meeting
6126215 the reports cite unnamed india officials as saying they are hesitant to do so that is not surprising since indias participation in the discussion could force its officials to answer some uncomfortable but essential questions about its bilateral nuclear cooperation agreements with the us france and russia as well as its interpretation of the india iaea safeguards agreement and other issues
6126216 the breakup of the soviet union is a national tragedy on an enormous scale
6126217 the soviet union was a very complicated page in the history of our people
6126218 i think that ordinary citizens of the former soviet union and the post soviet space gained nothing from this on the contrary people have faced a huge number of problems
6126219 today we must look at the reality we live in we cannot only look back and curse about this issue we must look forward
6126220 bring vladimir putin here and we will have a debate
6126221 putin is depriving the population of the right to choose
6126222 the head of state should not engage in self advertising
6126223 i am simply obliged before my voters and the entire country to account for what has been done during the past four years and to tell people what i intend to do during the next four years
6126224 is to propose to society a person he considers worthy to work further in this position
6126225 they see the head of state as a monarch who shouldnt participate in discussions with those below him in the hierarchy
6126226 planning and market forces are not the essential difference between planned economy is not the definition of socialism because there is planning under capitalism the market economy happens under socialism too planning and market forces are both ways of controlling economic activity
6126227 new economic development strategy based upon decentralization of control over the state owned enterprise sector expanded market transactions to replace command and control allocation dismantling of the rural commune system completed in 1985 increased use of material incentives in workplaces and ultimately upon the modernization of the chinese economic infrastructure as well as the military infrastructure this last aspect of their strategy represents more than a mere objective modernization represents the mission of the pragmatists deng xiaoping rejected the maoist tendency to forswear the technological trappings of the so called west including soft technology in the form of social relationships and embraced the idea that modernity required copying many of the traits of the western capitalist nations
6126228 chinese professor han deqiang in his paper chinese cultural revolution failure and theoretical originality china han detailed how from its very beginning the communist revolutionary government had been infiltrated by a capitalist faction which had established itself within the bureaucracy prominent among the bureaucrats was deng xiaoping
6126229 what is socialism and what is marxism we were not quite clear about this in the past marxism attaches utmost importance to developing the productive forces we have said that socialism is the primary stage of communism and that at the advanced stage the principle of from each according to his ability and to each according to his needs will be applied this calls for highly developed productive forces and an overwhelming abundance of material wealth therefore the fundamental task for the socialist stage is to develop the productive forces the superiority of the socialist system is demonstrated in the final analysis by faster and greater development of those forces than under the capitalist system as they develop the peoples material and cultural life will constantly improve one of our shortcomings after the founding of the peoples republic was that we didnt pay enough attention to developing the productive forces socialism means eliminating poverty pauperism is not socialism still less communism
6126230 production stagnated for a long time there was little improvement in peoples quality of life and chinas gap with developed economies widened further all of this made chinese communists ask themselves time and again the following questions where on earth was the superiority of socialism was socialism rich or poor what is revolution and what was its purpose the theory of building socialism with chinese characteristics which took the development of the productive forces as its fundamental task came into being amid and as a result of these reflections and reviews
6126231 hurray for the positive bits and pieces of russian opinion about reagan i too am surprised at the overwhelmingly positive nature of the posts from russia i also used to enjoy lunch at the central house of writers as the guest of a retired editor at izvestia on that note it is interesting to see the opinion in the article by bratersky of izvestia regarding the effect of star wars on the soviet budget bankruptcy it seems that many commentators offer an opinion that supports such a position i support a slightly different position the ussr bankrupted itself over many issues and over many years star wars was only one facet of the equation the myriad of causes of their demise included a corrupt inefficient internal mechanism that sold goods to its people at a price that had no relationship to the cost of development manufacture and distribution i vividly remember purchasing a finely tooled hammer at a state shop in omsk in 1993 for the equivalent in rubles price of three us pennies its origin was czech brought thousands of miles made from the finest metal and wood and finished beautifully thats a lot to say about a simple hammer i know but it was typical of the goods i found in siberia imported in many cases from great distances finely made yet cheaply packaged if at all and sold at ridiculously low prices for the benefit of her peoples who for the most part in those days earned 15 20 per month if that much the ussr used hard currency revenues us dollars earned from international sales of its natural resources oil diamonds timber and so forth to subsidize such unprofitable operations and trade over many decades and thus to keep the proletariat happy hard currency dollars from oil sales allowed the government to purchase other goods and materials needed in every facet of their life goods and foods not available in sufficient numbers from their own factories and fields when reagan entered office oil was trading above 35 per barrel having been above 40 during the carter administration by 1986 it was below 10 over the next several years oil hovered in the 10 20 range give or take the ussr was bankrupted soon thereafter as a result while my russian friends tell me that there were never enough goods on the shelves of stores in russia the problem grew much worse in the 80s the lack of hard currency from oil exports certainly was a contributory factor there are those among president reagans entourage who believe that his administration caused the price of oil to dip and stay low over years as another element in the effort to bankrupt the ussr in fact reagan did loosen controls on oil and gas production thus resulting in a glut and the lower prices of course there are many other reasons for the demise of the ussr but a system of manufacturing and distribution that has no relationship to the cost of the goods seems like a good place to start
6126232 i agree that the soviet union collapsed of its own weight
6126233 the effect of explanatory work has appeared the return desirable all they wished to avoid has occurred with double the force queues lengthened prices in the markets have jumped at home in queues in transport on work at assemblies people have openly worn the
6126234 economic reforms have similar origins but very different effects on their respective countries economies
6126235 the tests had no validity because the indian lab is not accredited by the world anti dope agency it does not follow procedure its report was given internally and we have not been given a copy
6126236 the entire episode appears to be a big manipulative game played by the sports authority of india the national dope testing laboratory and the indian olympic association against a sportsperson whose dream for the olympics has been shattered
6126237 we have written to directorate general of foreign trade dgft and the commerce ministry in this regard and if the finance ministry also approves it we will be able to buy diesel from reliance as is the case with lpg
6126238 it is being examined if domestic sales by reliance in the dta can be given a deemed export status and it continues to get income tax waiver
6126239 the question of justifying tomorrows strike does not arise since we have not called it it is up to those who have called the strike to make it a success if people respond to the strike it would be successful
6126240 our strike is not anti industry but to protest the centres anti labour anti economic policies including moves to amend labour laws divestment unemployment and price rise
6126241 above all it is against the indo us nuclear deal that would compromise our national sovereignty
6126242 we have called the general strike but workers of tata motors will decide whether to work tomorrow or not we are not going to stop them forcibly in fact we want progress in tata motors work in singur
6126243 there will be no problem for ministers to attend office at writers buildings tomorrow it will be the same with partha chatterjee who enjoys cabinet rank as leader of the opposition in the assembly
6126244 i will not ask for security from the state government for travelling to writers if bandh supporters prevent me i shall return home straight
6126245 i am urging industrialists present here to persuade the government to resolve the singur issue in return i will consider solving the bandh problem
6126246 the ruling party has called a bandh tomorrow is this democracy bandh should be a tool to be used by the opposition
6126247 it is not that we favour bandhs and gheraos but its a tool of protest that we use as a last resort
6126248 let the tatas build their factory on 600 650 acres and let ancillary units be relocated somewhere nearby
6126249 i dont want the tatas to leave i dont believe in tata bye bye but simultaneously want the government to be fair to the farmers
6126250 i would not be unethical by disclosing contents of the tata motors letter however on the basis of what they have written i can say that they need 650 acres for the small car plant and not 1 000 acres
6126251 moreover the ancillary units coming up in singur would not only supply materials to tata motors but also other companies across the globe so why did the government issue the notification that 1 000 acres would be required for the tata project
6126252 the chief minister should have realised that acceptance or rejection of our demand for the return of 400 acres at singur would be a policy decision and his presence at tomorrows meeting was a must
6126253 actually his intention is to drag the issue and persuade us to defer our agitation so that the tatas can roll out their small car by october so tomorrows meeting would be a meeting without results
6126254 the tata small car project does not need these 400 acres
6126255 happy to get a letter from the chief minister inviting us for talks on singur

6126397 the rachel maddow show is taken its on air america
6126398 rachel is unbelievably talented and brilliant her breadth and depth of knowledge of politics and news is astonishing and im so excited to give her a place to really showcase what she can do
6126399 weve established msnbc as the place for politics and the destination for viewers who want the smartest take on the days developments adding rachel into our primetime lineup makes perfect sense
6126400 ive loved working with msnbc and being asked to host my own show is an amazing opportunity
6126401 when dan served as general manager he really laid the groundwork for msnbcs success today with ratings growing 62 percent under his watch

6126404 the people of this village have been wary of the coalition forces for the past several years because they have seen units come and go and promises made that were never fulfilled
6126405 we wanted to assure them that we were different and to help prove our resolve we lived among them in their impoverished community experiencing for a short time the life they have always known
6126406 one of our main goals at this point is to put control of all future developments into the hands of the iraqi people
6126407 we want iraqi people in charge of iraqi projects using iraqi money and iraqi workers as soon as possible which will further stabilize the country and allow our forces to withdraw
6126408 no matter how big or small our operations might be we remain dedicated in our efforts to help the iraqi people gain a new life
6126409 despite the best of intentions it is impossible to change the minds of everyone but every little bit helps each new gesture that makes a difference is another step closer to permanent change
6126410 when i talk to my family and friends back home they want to know what its really like over here and if we are truly making a difference
6126411 each time i have explained to them the kind of change they have not witnessed yet battles and lethal operations have long ago ceased to be priorities our focus now is a return to normalcy living and working and interacting with the iraqi people positive changes are happening every day they might not be big or flashy but they are making lasting improvements that have already put victory for the iraqi people within their reach

6126431 contrary to the claims made by comcast and others the fcc is well within its authority to protect the open internet either by adopting rules or acting on complaints it is the fccs responsibility to promote openness free speech and competition the bedrock goals of the communications act
6126432 standing on the solid legal foundation established today by the fcc internet users must remain vigilant in defending an open internet cable and phone companies would now be wise to obey the law they can trust that the fcc is ready to punish any violations

6126447 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6126448 youre back there giving it everything youve got its brutal
6126449 hes doing it and making it look so simple michael johnson did it and it didnt looked that easy
6126450 the president personally called rohullah nikpai and congratulated him for this achievement
6126451 when i saw that he won i jumped up and hugged and kissed my son
6126452 i am so happy i cannot express my feelings in words

6126462 how about some discussion from the mccain campaign about a conservative who can be counted on across the board who can help lead the country in the right direction
6126463 who can help rebuild the republican party lieberman cant do that and rebuild the conservative movement mccain nor lieberman nor ridge can do that
6126464 mccain has already seen to it that he can walk across the aisle that hes the top of the ticket
6126465 if anybody is going to attract moderates its going to be the top of the ticket guy hes not going to help himself any additional way hes going to hurt himself by putting a liberal or a liberal republican on this ticket particularly pro choice
6126466 i think mccain would like to pick him but he voted against samuel alito and is pro choice its hard to imagine the reaction at the convention and the conservatives to that circumstance
6126467 john mccain has some political capital with conservatives right now pro life conservatives but not that much and it would be very easy for him to squander with the wrong choice
6126468 at the end of the day youre only giving your private counsel to the president publicly you echo the presidents position and i think every vice president understands that and appreciates thats the rule
6126469 all i know is that my friend of 25 years john mccain is strongly and forever pro life he also believes that you shouldnt be judgmental on other peoples point of view with regard to this and some other very difficult issues and as i said before i think hell make the right choice for his vice presidential nominee

6126525 for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding lifesaving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous
6126526 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
6126527 he needs to explain misleading people he needs to explain why he apparently covered that up
6126528 theyre being very dishonest about their depiction of what happened with that bill or just clueless
6126529 to the point the deputy said he was going to go unconscious
6126530 the deputy is pretty beat up in his facial area
6126531 thats a policy decision on the part of that department
6126532 if theres a cage theyre going in the back seat
6126533 theyre highly devoted to what theyre doing and it just creeps up on them
6126534 we heard what i can only describe as a wailing
6126535 and i let things go i was so tired and my mind wasnt working
6126536 now i think its safe to say its time for him to be held accountable
6126537 what are we doing this week to have more fun
6126538 n o press o a mais nenhuma press o nossa do grupo a gente ganhar pela gente mesmo
6126539 n s queremos fazer o nosso mas por n s pelo pa s pela na o que representamos mas conseguir medalha para aumentar o quadro n o seria um pensamento justo

6126541 l t dans cette r gion est un moment particulier une poque deuphorie et de sentimentalisme
6126542 but at the same time it generates a huge volume of calls and the staff manning the service need to deal with a huge range of problems and different levels of complexity
6126543 because gotoassist is a hosted service we have the flexibility to scale up and down in terms of subscriptions according to customer demand speed of set up was crucial to us and because were not involved in the maintenance of the system were free to concentrate on the customer experience
6126544 remote assistance was a real priority for us in order to position techfriend as a premium service and ensure its future growth and using a hosted service has helped us achieve that
6126545 we still had to perform a range of tasks ourselves which was time consuming and expensive it was really starting to eat into the working week
6126546 e mail is essential to us as an organisation but that doesnt mean me and my team of seven should be spending a disproportionate amount of our time struggling to keep e mail systems clean and secure
6126547 using webroot weve found that around 86 of the e mail syha receives can be categorised as spam and keeping tabs on that ourselves would involve a lot of wasted effort
6126548 im definitely interested in trialling other saas applications in future because im finding that they free me and my team to concentrate on more strategic issues
6126549 making the decision to use atlantas hosted dr service was primarily an issue of recovery time and costs
6126550 thats a vast improvement from the previous situation where dr was handled in house using tape back ups
6126551 when something went wrong it sometimes took a day or so for full service to be restored
6126552 we were up and running again in under an hour just as atlanta promised in its service level agreement
6126553 one thing was clear any solution had to meet our expectation while keeping a tight rein on costs
6126554 i became intrigued about saas having read nick carrs book

6126562 he set the bar so high we know it would be really difficult to beat were just so proud of him
6126563 my silver medal is gold to me because of all the bad things that happened to me this year

6126566 for the past eight years hes probably been the most inspirational canadian athlete ive gotten to know
6126567 today was just like icing on the cake i didnt know what a triathlon was really in 1999 and then watching it in 2000 was eye opening and probably the main force in changing my attitude towards the way i treated my training
6126568 watching simon win in 2000 was one of those moments that i just kind of realized that i want to be a canadian athlete and i want to be an olympic champion and i want to race at a world class level

6126665 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
6126666 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro

6126687 how can it be good news that a commercial software company is taking ownership of a free community tool
6126688 i think we can provide a level of resources that will move the tool forward in a big way the first thing we are doing is continuing to offer the software to the community for free downloading the second thing is giving our product management and usability teams the task of going out into the community to get suggestions on how we can make this amazing tool even better we accept the fact that there will be scepticism but we can point to a good track record of support for the community people were wary a couple of years ago when we purchased the sql server central community site but over time we have won over many of our critics by investing heavily in the site and boosting its readership while allowing it to maintain editorial independence im hoping i will be able to sit here in a few years time and claim the same level of success with reflector

6126742 his achievement came at a time when south africans had given up hope of getting a medal at these olympics
6126743 although she did not win a medal her courage and participation at these olympics will go down in history as one of the highlights of the beijing olympics and will go a long way towards motivating youth in south africa and the world never to give up their dreams
6126744 in 2002 when the so called floor crossing legislation was adopted this house supported the legislation with an overwhelming majority of 280 out of 324
6126745 in december 2007 the anc at its polokwane conference came to the conclusion that the political terrain which necessitated floor crossing has changed and therefore floor crossing had to be scrapped
6126746 translated into plain english this meant that we dont need it any more so let us get rid of it before it backfires on us
6126747 if ever there was a travesty of democracy it was floor crossing
6126748 i just made a conscious decision to take a break i just didnt feel like working its as simple as that
6126749 not at all if anything the success of that movie will help us
6126750 we hope it will open doors especially for the 40 plus set in hollywood
6126751 i think 50 years from now when we look back on this generation of women who were told that we could have it all and tried to people are going to go what the hell were they doing
6126752 its very hard to be a career person and have a relationship i didnt succeed at doing it all its incredibly hard
6126753 thats a really old fashioned idea its so low for someone to have said that they dont say that about men so its sexist and horribe
6126754 i may one day but it wont be because someone told me to i alsot think that the demographics of who sees movies have changed
6126755 women over 31 want movies that are about them so there are a lot of big surprises left the baby boom generation is getting older and it wants something more satisfying than why the movie makers expect
6126756 i am so excited im just trying to contain it
6126757 they rejected me i dont think i was a bad singer i honestly dont
6126758 theyre not looking for good singers theyre looking for an image
6126759 i sang and they felt i wasnt needed for this season
6126760 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people
6126761 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6126762 i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
6126763 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
6126764 all of it was spent on making her as big as she is now
6126765 language that is obscene offensive or of a seriously insulting nature
6126766 i accept that in international cricket there is a lot of passion but that does not excuse players talking back to umpires in an aggressive manner as happened in this case
6126767 that is unacceptable and i hope this decision and the fine imposed demonstrates that fact
6126768 unfortunately no matter the outcome of this trial this schedule alone may not be enough to ensure that senator stevens has the ability to compete meaningfully in the upcoming election
6126769 were venue transferred to alaska senator stevens would have the opportunity to campaign in the evenings and on weekends during the trial
6126770 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
6126771 i walked into this place for the first time on a wet july morning in 2005 and thought yes this is it
6126772 i favor the pristine and classic all u s stock market and all bond market approach
6126773 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged
6126774 i never attempt to make money on the stock market i buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years
6126775 unless you can watch your stock holding decline by 50 without becoming panic stricken you should not be in the stock market

6126780 sure it gets lonely sometimes but look i have a beautiful wife im happy ive got good friends
6126781 well i dont need a hundred friends that usually means a hundred gifts a year
6126782 sure it gets lonely sometimes but look i have a beautiful wife im happy ive got good friends

6126790 like this case most people who are infected with west nile virus dont ever get sick or have symptoms yet it can be a very serious disease for a small number of people especially those older than 50

6126794 vamos convidar todos os trabalhadores a participar dessa luta e estimular manifesta es pelo pa s a defesa pela educa o p blica de qualidade uma bandeira nacional e n o apenas dos professores
6126795 o professor precisa desse tempo para preparar as aulas corrigir provas discutir propostas pedag gicas receber os pais de alunos criar novos projetos para a escola
6126796 hoje o professor trabalha em 3 4 escolas e corrige provas em sua casa de madrugada preciso investir em melhoria nas condi es de trabalho
6126797 o projeto tramitou por mais de um ano no congresso durante esse tempo todos os pontos da lei estavam abertos discuss o questionar agora antidemocr tico e desmoraliza o congresso nacional
6126798 is incorrect because only are based on mathematical models and presented results at scenarios that do not include for example solar activity
6126799 curiously the star never has been seen as a cooling agent but warming but has two roles
6126800 so that in two years or so there will be a small ice age that lasts from 60 to 80 years
6126801 the sun has been lying low for the past couple of years producing no sunspots
6126802 i saw three brown dogs having a feed of this bloke they were down on the inside of his legs
6126803 he was there lying on the ground i hunted those dogs i threw rocks at them and yelled at them to get away from the man
6126804 i ran over and then put my fingers on his neck to check for a pulse but he was dead i yelled out and told one of my relations to call the cops
6126805 i think bella is a bit underdeveloped as a character
6126806 hermione was first and foremost a person and shes realistic its a pity bella doesnt have a secret inner strength shes more of just a pure maiden
6126807 i wish president musharraf all the best we have had difficult days together but also we had good days together all in all we had a good relationship
6126808 the most important thing is not personalities what is important is that we change our expectations and the way we formulate policies to meet those expectations
6126809 if they are doing that in order to get strategic depth it will not happen it has been tried before it failed if they are doing that in order to have a puppet government it will not happen it will not work
6126810 this sort of behaviour it is putting entire regions along the murray darling basin on their knees
6126811 but at the moment for the people who are up the top of the basin it is first in best dressed showing no concern for anyone down lower it is un australian
6126812 we are going to be running out of water in the next few weeks there will be water for critical human needs and that is it everyone is starting to get very anxious
6126813 we know river systems dont respect state borders surely in the middle of one of the worst droughts in our history we can get our institutional structure in place to recognise that reality
6126814 the desperate need to accelerate the purchase of environmental water so we can secure the health of those river systems
6126815 we have also committed to working with state governments to co fund the purchase of appropriately located irrigation properties and their water entitlements to enhance environmental outcomes in the northern basin
6126816 public storage facilities had enjoyed inflow and rivers have run at their best for several years providing extended opportunity to harvest water
6126817 which demonstrates the highly variable way that streams can run in queensland
6126818 breaks out into floodplains or alternatively feeds into terminal wetlands resulting in a great loss of this water
6126819 this means that the scope for substantial volume to flow through to the murray is very limited
6126820 we need to implement an interim basin plan within months so that we can start managing this system given the circumstances we currently find ourselves in
6126821 the river systems and the agricultural systems are collapsing and our institutional response needs to match that reality that nature has imposed on us
6126822 we are not really pointing the finger at the irrigators up there you do what you are allowed to do
6126823 water is a shared responsibility if the states cant handle it and cant agree it has got to move to federal control
6126824 we probably did take a fair bit of water in queensland this year simply because the river ran for a long period of time
6126825 towns almost died up here everybody just stopped spending money
6126826 most farms let most of their staff go seven dry years it was past anything anyone could ever believe
6126827 a lot of sorghum and sunflowers and soybeans there is a bit of wheat in now
6126828 it has got some cash flow going and it has got the towns going again
6126829 mr ray quarcoo took my brother emmanuel and i when we were young amateurs and made us the envy of the local boxing scene he clothed us nicely for our boxing events and took very good care of us he was and still remains a god father
6126830 its been my desire to help develop talents in sports and polish them i just love being a blessing to people
6126831 theres been speculation so ive learned from the media nobody has tried to contact me
6126832 my future currently rests at real madrid the competition hasnt started yet but i will have to look at what situation im in once it does
6126833 i still want to work hard in order to get more playing time the best thing for a footballer is to have the confidence of his coach bernd schuster has given me his confidence
6126834 i am very happy i think the final score was fair because argentina played very well every argentine is happy today not just me today is a lovely day
6126835 as for di mar a i honestly have to say i dont know much about him hes surprised me in the olympics he is very young and has an important position on the team
6126836 im sure he will play for an important club in the future but i dont know if hell come here he is a quality player and im sure hell have a very good career
6126837 and robinho i only teased him a little we joked for a while and then got to work
6126838 barcelona have undergone a great change theyve been playing at a high level this pre season im sure they will be a tough opponent
6126839 the new coach has brought in important reinforcements and i believe theyll have a great year if they continue to play this well
6126840 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
6126841 i have not just come here to play and then leave again
6126842 my first target is to simply play good football in training and get into the team as i have come here to be successful
6126843 i am not even thinking about a life beyond rangers i am only focused on working hard so that the club takes up its option to buy me and i am here for many years
6126844 desire is to win a little bit of space and perhaps make my debut at the olimpico against roma on august 31
6126845 this decision just does not make a lot of sense to me
6126846 all across the nation american families are gathered in front of their tv sets to watch the falling of the towers and were giving them absolutely nothing to lash out at what a perfect time to remind them that if not for the aggressive actions of belligerent warmongers like john mccain this tragedy would never have befallen us but try talking sense to barrack obama why doncha i love the guy but what a knucklehead
6126847 obama isnt running any negative spots hell john mccain isnt running any spots period of course all of his ads are negative so i guess its nox nix but still its 911 and his opponents name is hussein obama and i mean maybe im getting too old for the political game i dont know life gives you a lemon and you just put it in the fridge maybe im too old
6126848 taking into account the current situation in the capital markets and the change in level of prices in the stock markets since may 2008
6126849 it is a taboo subject in defence which apparently hasnt learned anything since vietnam
6126850 the song die tonight live forever came about at a strange time for us early on in the bands timeline where we had all just moved in together had just signed our indie deal in the us with stolen transmission and were spending all our time programming writing and recording
6126851 michael probably wont be fit and mark viduka certainly wont be i could rush michael back but then that might knock him back five or six weeks
6126852 we are probably strong enough to do without the two of them but when they come back it will give us a massive boost
6126853 always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people
6126854 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people
6126855 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6126856 jessica is americas sweetheart and an internationally known entertainer who takes care of herself you can see it in her smile her skin her confidence and her obvious physical fitness
6126857 as we anticipated july advertising activity turned out to be only slightly better than june
6126858 online advertising continues to be a bright spot for the company
6126859 in gr bming fuhren wir den korso der ennstal classic entlang und wurden von den besuchern begeistert empfangen
6126860 i try to do just 1 200 calories a day
6126861 it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things
6126862 how is that possible that 300 workers can go abroad without being certain about working conditions the nature of the work and payment as well as health and social insurance
6126863 i will first take a rest afterwards and with a clear mind we will think about it and take a decision
6126864 i have the feeling that the whole country was crying with me because everyone who met we yesterday when she returned from beijing told me
6126865 a test was made of plamen on july 21 the results were within the limits allowed
6126866 i dont know for what reasons one engineer and one chemist decided that there was a problem
6126867 i purchase mushrooms any kind in large packages wash drain and slice them and saut in butter or margarine when cooled completely i place the mushrooms in a freezer bag flatten and seal it and freeze it when i want to add mushrooms to anything i am making i simply break off the amount i need and return the bag to the freezer
6126868 es ist immer noch wahnsinnig schwer f r leute am rande der gesellschaft reinzufinden

6126870 dieser widerstand des r ubers knei l diese rebellion die finde ich ganz wunderbar in einer gesellschaft die nur auf angepasstheit aus ist
6126871 am anfang mochten ihn die leute nicht doch dann hat er aufbegehrt und die obrigkeit zum narren gehalten

6126873 we cant arrange long term care here so we try to do the best we can in the country of origin
6126874 the question is is the hospital acting as an immigration agent in effect by deporting this patient
6126875 its important to make sure that hospitals arent permitted to dump patients on an international level when they cant do it on a local level
6126876 hospitals dont have the financial resources to meet all of the acute care needs of patients without insurance let alone take on all the chronic care needs that present with patients like this
6126877 there were certain legal procedures that the hospital should have followed that they bypassed
6126878 we have worked with the individual who has had primary decision making responsibility for the patient
6126879 es steht au er frage dass kurt beck ein untadeliger demokrat von hoher politischer glaubw rdigkeit ist dem es gut ansteht der opfer der stasi zu gedenken
6126880 und heute kurt beck gedenkt zwar bei einem besuch in einem ehemaligen stasigef ngnis ffentlichkeitswirksam der opfer doch politisch scheint die spd die vergangenheit vergessen zu haben
6126881 den unrechtscharakter der ehemaligen ddr zu hinterfragen vermeintliche vorz ge des kommunistischen systems zu konstruieren und die verbrechen der stasi schergen an den b rgerinnen und b rgern der ddr zu relativieren
6126882 die csu hat also keinen grund mit dem finger auf andere parteien zu zeigen
6126883 political maneuver by the fmln to discredit the work of the pnc

6126892 these clean up grant and work partnership with local state and federal agencies will help us to protect the health of our people and our environment
6126893 early in the game they made a lot of tough shots
6126894 we were doing what we were supposed to be doing and they made tough shots but sooner or later well impose our will i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6126895 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat
6126896 theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend
6126897 theyre a force to be reckoned with they caused us a lot of problems
6126898 in the third quarter we said the first three or four minutes we need to pick it up a little bit defensively and make the extra pass offensively
6126899 i think it is fair to say that the d c circuit has repudiated the vast bulk of the bush administrations clean air regulatory reforms which were the administrations most notable and significant if not always wise environmental policy initiatives

6126910 this might appear a simple feature to a modern audience but from then on you didnt only play against the machine but also against human opponents
6126911 today the games market is at least as important as other branches of the entertainment sector like film or music with one difference the games market is booming
6126912 of course some games are bloody and they should not be in the hands of children but that does nothing to change their aesthetic qualities
6126913 nonetheless with inflation close to a peak and the economy heading towards recession we still think rates could be falling by year end and will eventually drop much further than the markets expect
6126914 es muy grande estoy todav a conmocionado llevaba tanto tiempo aspirando al r cord del mundo

6126918 if you have never seen race walking think of a kid whos running around the side of a pool deck and the lifeguard blows the whistle and says no running you need to walk they automatically break into a racewalk
6126919 it was very sort of surreal being in this huge group of athletes and the energy was just unbelievable and as i was walking into the stadium i was very emotional i was starting to cry because i couldnt believe that it had finally happened and i was going to be taking part in this thing that i had dreamed of for so long
6126920 when im home and im training on the road everybody and their brother has an ipod on you know joe jogger always has an ipod and at this level no one
6126921 im 44 years old and im competing against people that this is what they do 24 7 this is their life and for some of these young girls and young women this is all theyve ever done winning a gold medal for them has been their entire lifes focus and that has never been mine

6126926 if you dont find god in the next person you meet it is a waste of time looking for him further
6126927 it is our duty as men and women to behave as though limits to our ability do not exist we are co creators of the universe
6126928 whatever you can do or dream you can begin it boldness has genius power and magic in it begin it now
6126929 the only people who get anywhere interesting are the people who get lost

6126933 we all know that a rocket burns most of its fuel during the first few moments of flight as it overcomes inertia and the gravitational pull of the earth thats what its like for us as we launch our dreams into physical reality
6126934 at the critical juncture in all human relationships there is only one question what would love do now
6126935 success in life is a matter not so much of talent or opportunity as of concentration and perseverance
6126936 the road to success is not to be run upon by seven leagued boots step by step little by little bit by bit that is the way to wealth that is the way to wisdom that is the way to glory pounds are the sons not of pounds but of pence
6126937 in the private sanctuary of ones own conscience lies that spirit that determination to cast off the old person and to measure up to the stature of true potential
6126938 it is never too late to be what you might have been
6126939 you are here to enrich the world and you impoverish yourself if you forget that errand
6126940 it had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them they went out and happened to things
6126941 wherever you are is always the right place there is never a need to fix anything to hitch up the bootstraps of the soul and start at some higher place start right where you are
6126942 everything you need you already have you are complete right now you are a whole total person not an apprentice person on the way to someplace else
6126943 who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented and fabulous
6126944 no compromise with the main purpose no peace till victory no pact with unrepentant wrong
6126945 but weve never really tried to measure it weve said if were richer and we have more options we must be better off but we havent tried to find out if its really true
6126946 while there was a small month on month increase in activity it represented a notable decline from a year ago
6126947 this continues the weaker picture seen in june and points towards the more subdued levels of lending we are likely to see in the second half of 2008
6126948 that he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head

6127009 and if this frolic should lay me up with a fit of the rheumatism i shall have a blessed time with dame van winkle
6127010 what brought him to the election with a gun on his shoulder and a mob at his heels and whether he meant to breed a riot in the village
6127011 i am a poor quiet man a native of the place and a loyal subject of the king god bless him
6127012 nicholas vedder why he is dead and gone these eighteen years there was a wooden tombstone in the church yard that used to tell all about him but thats rotten and gone too
6127013 oh he went off to the army in the beginning of the war some say he was killed at the storming of stony point others say he was drowned in a squall at the foot of antonys nose i dont know he never came back again
6127014 he went off to the wars too was a great militia general and is now in congress
6127015 oh to be sure thats rip van winkle yonder leaning against the tree
6127016 im not somebody me somebody else got into my shoes i was myself last night but i fell asleep on the mountain and theyve changed my gun and every things changed and im changed and i cant tell whats my name or who i am
6127017 hush you little fool the old man wont hurt you
6127018 ah poor man rip van winkle was his name but its twenty years since he went away from home with his gun and never has been heard of since his dog came home without him but whether he shot himself or was carried away by the indians nobody can tell i was then but a little girl
6127019 oh she too had died but a short time since she broke a blood vessel in a fit of passion at a new england peddler
6127020 sure enough it is rip van winkle it is himself welcome home again old neighbor why where have you been these twenty long years
6127021 the story of rip van winkle may seem incredible to many but nevertheless i give it my full belief for i know the vicinity of our old dutch settlements to have been very subject to marvellous events and appearances indeed i have heard many stranger stories than this in the villages along the hudson all of which were too well authenticated to admit of a doubt i have even talked with rip van winkle myself who when last i saw him was a very venerable old man and so perfectly rational and consistent on every other point that i think no conscientious person could refuse to take this into the bargain nay i have seen a certificate on the subject taken before a country justice and signed with a cross in the justices own handwriting the story therefore is beyond the possibility of doubt d k

6127176 all the evidence so far indicates that these qualitative differences in nutrition are causal in determining caste though were missing the final link in order to determine if it was casual
6127177 there are some cases where nature completely wins out but all of this is telling us theres a nice interaction between nature and nurture across most social insects
6127178 the benefit to the colony in having the nurture part is that it allows flexibility
6127179 they can quickly and easily change what caste theyre producing to fit their environment better but having the nature component benefits the individual because it can bias its development toward becoming reproductive its a balance between what the individual wants versus what the colony wants
6127180 as mark twain once said when one has tasted watermelon he knows what the angels eat i encourage my colleagues to join me in acknowledging the wisdom of mark twain by supporting this resolution
6127181 we also recognize that we have more to do and we will do so both in the remaining weeks of this years congress and next year when we will have expanded democratic majorities in the house and the senate working with president barack obama
6127182 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
6127183 resolutions are fine but why arent we also passing legislation to lower gas prices what about health care reform and runaway entitlement spending
6127184 not only do you create heat stroke awareness month every year after that you recognize the importance of heat stroke awareness month you never move on to substantive legislation

6127190 we need to do all we can to keep our kids from turning to drugs violence and crime these behaviors tear families and communities apart and we need to be proactive and invest in their future now
6127191 this funding for the department of corrections will help prevent young people in our state from turning to crime my hometown prosperity plan calls for increased investments in the public good and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment

6127193 this funding from the department of health amp human services will help state healthcare centers provide comprehensive medical services to many mainers
6127194 we are pleased to see continued federal support for our states ongoing effort to facilitate essential healthcare accessibility for people throughout maine
6127195 in rural states like south dakota fire departments like the dallas volunteer fire department play a crucial role in keeping residents safe
6127196 it is essential that personnel have the equipment and training needed to respond safely and effectively to an emergency
6127197 one of the pillars of my hometown prosperity plan is investing in the public good and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment
6127198 drugs violence and crime tear communities apart and we need to help address the behaviors that lead to violent crime
6127199 those affected by drug use extend far beyond the user to effect families and the public this funding will help put an end to these destructive behaviors
6127200 these funds help ensure that the estuary research program at rutgers will continue to provide environmental educational and public health benefits to our coastal communities
6127201 we need to do all we can to keep new jersey at the forefront of water and coastal research and this grant will further that effort
6127202 the environment here in the garden state is one of our state treasures and this type of monitoring will help us keep up with the changing climate and its effect on our coastal communities
6127203 i am pleased that students will benefit from this funding and will be encouraged to continue to care for our environment it is important to educate future generations in protecting our natural resources for the benefit and health of our state

6127208 i am committed to finding reasonable solutions that protect the solvency of the usf and keep prices in rural areas low and i know that will require all of us working together
6127209 i think its divisive for the support hillary campaign to continue at this time she made the decision to fully support mr obama
6127210 i dont know why theyre not taking their cue from hillary and falling in line
6127211 her supporters acting on their own because theyre proud of what they have done for her
6127212 obama could not seal the deal with voters during the primaries
6127213 the more voters got to know him the more voters chose hillary clinton
6127214 democrats must offer voters the candidate with the best chance of winning in november the experienced candidate who understands the problems we face and the solutions we need senator hillary rodham clinton
6127215 ashamed of the strong arming political threats and thinly veiled suggestions that have been sent to democratic delegates and superdelegates during this primary season these thug tactics appear to be increasing as senator obama begins the downward slide in the polls and senator clintons support grows
6127216 where obama once got a free pass on such despicable relationships with anti american people such as rev jeremiah wright ayers rezko soros pfleger farakkhan the american voters are beginning to realize what a questionable and shady past this man has led
6127217 i cant tell you how fortunate lamoille county is for getting a program like this kevin kelley the center director told the reported that a change by comcast in its channel lineup has caused a statewide stir
6127218 we are going to need congressional action to make sure that people can get reasonably priced cable television left alone prices will continue to rise and families are going to be priced out of cable television
6127219 the number of people now who are able to get high quality health care has significantly expanded we are making progress
6127220 but we all recognize that we have a long way to go
6127221 this will be a great addition to the services we provide and will sustain the program in the future
6127222 the access for all america act would make certain that every man woman and child in this country has access to comprehensive primary care services
6127223 i believe can perform a vital role in providing good information and scholarship for the policy makers at the national level at the state level and the local level
6127224 i do know it is an ongoing concern of law enforcement officials in mexico and certainly the viciousness and violence of cartels is a something that is a little hard for people on this side to comprehend
6127225 i think that it is good here because you know the people here know about illegals and guns and trafficking crimes and all that
6127226 i didnt know that i thought guns most of them were coming from there to here
6127227 its unfortunate that important timber projects included in the management plan have been tied up in court and are now in the appeals process the decision to not hold up these projects which will bring long term benefits to both the environment and the economy in the granite state while out of state environmental groups continue to appeal is the right decision i call on the other members of the new hampshire congressional delegation to join me in supporting the 2005 forest management plan a carefully crafted compromise which will benefit the long term health of the forest and the state of new hampshire instead of supporting these out of state environmental groups for the purpose of a narrow interest driven national agenda

6127230 we believe that premiers equipment has failed to perform as required by its contracts and according to state law
6127231 we have taken this action to recover taxpayer funds spent for voting systems used in half of the states 88 counties
6127232 many of these vulnerabilities represent practical threats to the integrity of elections as they are conducted in ohio
6127233 we found vulnerabilities in different vendor systems that would for example allow voters and poll workers to place multiple votes to infect the precinct with virus software or to corrupt previously cast votes sometimes irrevocably
6127234 none of the systems out there are even remotely adequate given the importance of the data they handle
6127235 any software you put on your card would uploaded into the systems computer
6127236 there wasnt an attack that we tried that we werent able to carry out
6127237 we learned that every current e voting system has serious exploitable vulnerabilities
6127238 with the election being less than three months away the counties will be using the technology they have
6127239 the elections systems should have the same quality the same reliability the same testing and the same certification requirements as financial systems
6127240 if the systems used by banks which have to report to the sec securities and exchange commission had this level of quality no one would put their money in the bank

6127270 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
6127271 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
6127272 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
6127273 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
6127274 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
6127275 but what was really cool is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frog and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals

6127304 since gold is so oversold the extent of its rebound rise is now going to be very important
6127305 on the other hand if gold stays below 819 during the rebound rise itll mean that an important trend change is taking place and well either sell or lighten up on our holdings at a better price during the rebound well then plan to buy gold again once it turns technically bullish

6127360 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6127361 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6127362 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6127363 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6127364 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6127365 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6127366 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6127367 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6127368 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6127369 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6127370 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6127371 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6127372 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6127373 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6127374 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6127375 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6127376 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6127377 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6127378 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6127379 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6127380 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6127381 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6127382 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6127383 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6127384 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6127385 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6127386 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6127387 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6127388 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6127389 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6127390 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6127391 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6127392 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6127393 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6127394 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6127395 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6127396 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6127397 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6127398 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6127399 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6127400 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6127401 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6127402 bigelows human tended orbiting facilities are a building block of a space faring society
6127403 we are delighted to be working with aerojet on this pioneering project
6127404 we look forward to building our relationship with both our aerojet and bigelow customers as well as leveraging our expertise in systems engineering electronics design and rapid prototyping
6127405 interactive control panels and activity stations immersive 3d imagery and audio effects will plunge visitors into a not too distant future on the moon
6127406 theyll discover what it will be like to live and work on the surfaces of other worlds and how it will benefit life back home on earth
6127407 exhibit visitors can learn how our quality of life improves when americas space exploration activities refine existing technologies or develop new breakthroughs in areas such as power generation computer technology communications networking and robotics
6127408 visitors also can learn how other advanced technologies are increasing the safety and reliability of space transportation systems while also reducing costs
6127409 what kind of science project do you have me on
6127410 people who need people are the luckiest people in the world
6127411 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6127412 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6127413 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6127414 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6127415 to have a storm intensify over land and maintain that increased intensity while over land for 12 hours is hard to explain the only thing i can think is that recent rains in florida have formed large areas of standing water that the storm is feeding off of fay is also probably pulling moisture from lake okeechobee anyone want to write a ph d thesis on this case wow
6127416 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6127417 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6127418 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6127419 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6127420 itu kurang ajar bendera terbalik tiada hormat langsung dengan bendera kita apa yang marah sangat dengan bendera malaysia
6127421 sahaja nak bagi orang susah dengan buat cerita yang bukan bukan
6127422 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6127423 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6127424 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6127425 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6127426 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6127427 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6127428 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6127429 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6127430 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6127431 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6127432 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6127433 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6127434 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6127435 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6127436 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6127437 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6127438 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6127439 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6127440 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6127441 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6127442 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6127443 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6127444 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6127445 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6127446 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6127447 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6127448 were working on the next versions with motorola and blackberry rim were targeting the fourth quarter this year to bring them to market
6127449 believe it or not its much nicer having two reasonable vendors where you dont have 75 handsets to put on a portfolio
6127450 we have a very nice situation where weve been able to exclusively sit down with the designer and engineering group of motorola on a personal one to one basis we go into the lab with these guys and say this is what our market needs
6127451 i havent felt any sort of pinch from the iphone whatsoever as a matter of fact i think it enhances our sales to some extent because of the fact the iphone doesnt have the ptt feature
6127452 push to talk phones have a big fat button on the side with which you get a lot of things done very quickly and thats not the same dimension as youll get with an iphone

6127468 we are currently experiencing a reactively unchecked and dangerous situation
6127469 in the years 2008 2012 we will have reached the appropriate length of follow up time to begin to definitively observe the impact of this global technology on brain tumor incidence rates
6127470 malignant brain tumor incidence and its associated death rate will be observed globally to rise within a decade from now
6127471 by which time it may be far too late to meaningfully intervene
6127472 i wish one day you would tell me you have some secret real loving feelings for me instead of just the sex talk all the time i have never let anyone use me like i let you i know i am worth more than just sex yet i always crawl back to you each and every time you are my weakness should i forgive myself for letting someone blatantly take advantage of me

6127528 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6127529 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6127530 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6127531 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6127532 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6127533 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6127534 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6127535 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6127536 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6127537 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6127538 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6127539 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6127540 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6127541 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6127542 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6127543 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6127544 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6127545 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6127546 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6127547 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6127548 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6127549 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6127550 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6127551 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6127552 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6127553 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6127554 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6127555 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6127556 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6127557 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6127558 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6127559 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6127560 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6127561 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6127562 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6127563 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6127564 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6127565 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6127566 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6127567 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6127568 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6127569 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6127570 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6127571 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6127572 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6127573 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6127574 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6127575 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6127576 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6127577 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6127578 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6127579 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6127580 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6127581 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

6127583 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6127584 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6127585 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6127586 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6127587 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6127588 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6127589 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6127590 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6127591 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6127592 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6127593 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6127594 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6127595 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6127596 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6127597 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6127598 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6127599 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6127600 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6127601 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

6127611 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6127612 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county

6127679 the company remains strongly committed to ireland and its operations here
6127680 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6127681 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6127682 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6127683 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6127684 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 1
6127685 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6127686 not only did the clinton campaign give mccain and his advisers a road map but they actually started the mccains down that path
6127687 thats why youre hearing from obama very specific policy oriented proposals here
6127688 theres not a lot of that kind of flash if you will from the earlier days
6127689 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6127690 what the clinton campaign demonstrated is when you bring obama back down to earth its a better battle
6127691 how have college students changed since you first began teaching or since you were in college yourself

6127700 dediqu el gol a gianinna y a toda mi familia que estaban viendo el partido desde casa ellas me a oran mucho
6127701 i loved that a wide range of disciplines ages geography and experiences are represented by the essays the women representing the sciences psychology economics and history add a depth to the conversation one that im not sure could be achieved in a book of mfas and english phds consequently i would make this book a must read and a must gift for any woman contemplating or living with a graduate degree because so many of the women report being blindsided by parenthood and its impact on their careers i think this is an especially important read for those considering a graduate degree
6127702 its not all about the choice between dropping out or suffering mama phd also tells more than one tale of a mother at the end of her rope who was thrown a fresh one by an enlightened advisor mentor or department chair there are a few corners of academe that have put all the feminist theory of the past thirty years into some kind of practice and support actual women and their children there are small institutions that place a community value on families and children and the well rounded well being of professors
6127703 europe will not tolerate ethnic cleansing or terror against civilians
6127704 when you are older its not as cool to be drunk
6127705 but when you are in school you are so excited that your parents arent there that you feel you cant get into trouble and you are invincible
6127706 we think their first concern should be the health welfare and safety of the students and it certainly isnt
6127707 they want to take themselves off the hook if they change the law its not their problem
6127708 i spent next 14 months touring schools and i was appalled
6127709 i had no clue of the intensity of alcohol and behaviors that exist today
6127710 colleges need to make clear to students that certain behaviors are unacceptable like cheating and not paying your tuition bills what about excessive drinking
6127711 every college president was on one side of the table and we were on the other the presidents were mostly concerned with the image of their college and issues of liability
6127712 has to be one of the things a president thinks about
6127713 forces it underground and off campus where there is great risk
6127714 if youre allowed to drink whenever it demystifies the whole thing
6127715 all the data show that by the time they go to college they have already experienced alcohol so how can anyone say the law is working
6127716 colleges are not willing to be the bad guy and parents want them to
6127717 but they cant do it alone its a larger social problem to address harmful drinking
6127718 we need to all work together college presidents professors students deans and alumni along with city officials
6127719 i have a problem with the country saying to people you can send them off to die in iraq but you cant drink
6127720 its a little patronizing not all people are mature at 18 but some arent at 21
6127721 the switch is not turned on and they are still developing
6127722 they are away from home for the first time and are vulnerable
6127723 but when you make things prohibited you drive conduct underground
6127724 its true for recreational drugs marijuana and its true in sale of alcohol so you have a black market and a gray market behavior that seems a troubling phenomenon
6127725 since teenage drinkers cant go out and drink openly at bars and events they are confined to the dorms where there is not a lot to distract them
6127726 there is work presidents are and can be doing now that has nothing to do with the law to help students navigate this terrain
6127727 i am a supporter of madd but i like mccardells fresh and new ideas
6127728 once i turned 21 i definitely didnt drink as much
6127729 i drink more often but in smaller quantities before i would get really really drunk two nights a week now i have two beers and walk home
6127730 with more access people are much more responsible if they get really drunk they are thrown out
6127731 im tired of chasing my dreams im just gonna find out where theyre headed and hook up with them later
6127732 according to karma the girls are singing the flying of the cranes composed by the fifth dalai lama who is said to have been a sometime poet a prisoner sentenced to death is enclosed in a box and thrown into the river through the slats he spies two flying cranes and implores them to lend him the help of their wings asked if they did so karma shakes his head that prisoner was probably a romantic sort he says
6127733 there is no history only fictions of various degrees of plausibility
6127734 if i lie and say you took me for a friend patched together in my thin bones will you help me be cunning and noisy as the wind
6127735 the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie deliberate contrived and dishonest but the myth persistent persuasive and unrealistic
6127736 i got no alibis cant even tell my usual lies
6127737 excellency its a natural lie to tell i beg you stop this now
6127738 i might come to the end of my life and find out everyone was lying
6127739 so we cheated and we lied and we tested and we never failed to fail it was the easiest thing to do
6127740 some folks get spiritual cause they see the light some cause they feel the heat
6127741 jose luis gomez i said sit up straight and follow along in the book goddammit dont make me waste your sorry ass
6127742 miss rodriguez i dont care how many children you have to take care of at home if you dont complete your homework youre going to force me to use my gun
6127743 tamika if you dont sit your little smart ass down right this very minute im going to take out my gun and blow an even bigger hole in that ugly little face or yours
6127744 shut up you little muthafucka or ill pump you full of lead
6127745 im just going to aim at your head during your oral presentation remember i want you to project your voice to the back of the room and nothing angers me more than tears please begin
6127746 having said that if there is some sort of discrimination that comes out in the reporting that is arguably contrary to the code then i would also feel that it would be open to a complainant to challenge the reporting as being discriminatory on the grounds of race
6127747 im of the opinion that even if i dont like what you have to say i have to accept it theres lots of times i dont like what i read but im not the judge of that
6127748 im having a real philosophical problem with barbara hall recognizing freedom of expression and at the same time telling the media what their responsibility is
6127749 i wanted to call every single one of the nominees in because if were going to have a human rights system in ontario i think we deserve as ontarians to know what the individual philosophies are of these tribunal members
6127750 we contacted mr biscardi who gave us permission to begin an expedited melting process we set up a salamander heater to heat the freezer
6127751 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head as i was now able to touch it i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section
6127752 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6127753 the motives behind this fraud are still unknown at this time it is still unclear why whitton who being a police officer for the clayton county police department in georgia got up before the world and lied and was complicit in a scheme to defraud in a felonious manner
6127754 at this time the victim of this series of deceptions searching for bigfoot inc is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived by this deception due to this event peoples lives have been disrupted and many people so wanting vindication about there prior experiences were hurt let us all try to be mindful of such
6127755 we support the creation of this ufo trail because experts say that it is a hot zone for watchers
6127756 in no way can we guarantee that a tourist coming to san clemente will see a ufo
6127757 it was an orange object located about 400 meters 1 312 feet in the distance with oscillating movements
6127758 there sightings have been made of shining spheres going into the water and into wooded zones without any human explanation
6127759 you have to be naked your head has to go under water and a witness of the opposite sex must be present
6127760 im glad to see people are exercising their freedom of expression
6127761 i told the girls beforehand to keep the jiggling to a minimum and not to do anything that would be deemed offensive
6127762 never seen anything like it i liked the boobs but there wasnt enough of them
6127763 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6127764 youre back there giving it everything youve got its brutal
6127765 hes doing it and making it look so simple did it and it didnt looked that easy
6127766 as a result of concerns about the child the parents had set up a video camera in the childs room
6127767 during the course of the evening the child was put to bed in its cot during the evening the defendant was seen to leave the party area and go to the toilet
6127768 he was followed by the childs father and he saw the defendant coming from the direction of the childs bedroom
6127769 the father went to the childs room and could see the child had vomited and was in a distressed state in the cot
6127770 when looking at the video later he saw the defendant strike the child five times while he was sleeping then leave the room quickly
6127771 we know we will face a different team this go around
6127772 perhaps companies will want to put wind farms atop our bridges and skyscrapers or use the enormous potential of powerful off shore winds miles out in the atlantic ocean where turbines could generate roughly twice the energy that land based wind farms can
6127773 we want their best ideas for creating both small and large scale projects serving new yorkers
6127774 if rooftop wind can make it anywhere this is a great city
6127775 sadly this region has been despoiled of its scenic beauty by unchecked development
6127776 when people keep repeating that youll never fall in love
6127777 ive cleared my bedroom of magazines television and radio to make it an asylum from the outside world
6127778 i invite you to read my real life experience with starting an income online and the good and perhaps not so good experiences i faced until finally
6127779 people 50 to 64 are very busy so sometimes healthcare takes a back seat
6127780 the time to have a comprehensive checkup is before the problems arise so you can be completely up to date on all preventive measures and focus on your health lifestyle
6127781 for almost two thirds of todays retirees social security is their majority source of income and for millions over 65 health insurance would not be affordable without medicare yet all too often pre retirees know less about their social security and medicare benefits than any other piece of their retirement plan its critical that baby boomers do their homework
6127782 planning where to travel before you retire is the way to go travel is often cited as the number 1 wish of the pre 65 crowd and strategizing early can help you determine where and how youll live the best years of your life

6127787 weve definitely been excited about the growth and embrace of technology by both voters and candidates
6127788 its been explosive its light years from 2004 youtube didnt exist four years ago and now it is being heavily used for politics
6127789 google is attempting to expand its influence over the political process to help it achieve its commercial goals
6127790 google likes to bask in self congratulatory rhetoric claiming it has the publics interests at heart its all about accessing peoples data for targeted marketing
6127791 in this us election year what information could be more important than the candidates own words to describe their views actions and platforms
6127792 as idealistic as that sounds is as idealistic as we are it is exciting all around not just for google
6127793 this new politics is disruptive upsetting old arrangements and displacing people invested in the old ways
6127794 it is literally crashing the gate of the old system and to that i say amen
6127795 we have a very unique product challenging singletrack mountain bike adventures all over the world with a strong emphasis on local culture and on social and environmental responsibility
6127796 were now one of the top bike adventure companies in the world we decided that its time to re brand to reflect our global reach and our focus on community based mountain bike tourism the first step in that process is coming up with a new name
6127797 i put my bike down and ran to the river thinking about what i should do
6127798 then i realized that thinking wasnt going to do any good so i started swimming with my bike helmet still on
6127799 i dont want to see you in the water anymore

6127803 ya know what ive already woken up mom too many times this evening ill just hold off my crying for now so she can get the rest she needs
6127804 it hurts little jimmy when you roll over his fingers with your tonka truck
6127805 oasis were one of the first bands we ever really loved and to actually get on his radar is pretty special
6127806 i tell you what would be brilliant we should have him just singing mouthing the words in a chair
6127807 its so senseless there was absolutely no reason to assault her
6127808 the title is actually referring to djing when youre putting on some motown
6127809 originally it was going to be called bag it up and then it was going to be called shock of the lightning and then it was going to be called standing on the edge of the noise
6127810 i couldnt think of any ideas and then somebody had just taken bits of the lyrics out and dig out your soul was what came up i was like you know what titles become themselves
6127811 definitely maybe isnt a great title but if the album is good enough itll become itself dig out your soul is not the best one but dig out your soul was the best one on a day when we had to choose one
6127812 i was playing some drums on some demos left over from the last record
6127813 we sent them to producer dave sardy and he was like wow have you got any more songs like this we should make a record like this
6127814 and then going back to the stuff we ditched in the past we were like yeah we could do something with that or do something with this
6127815 slowly but surely it all started to change from a traditional british rock album to this whatever one we would describe it now
6127816 its got a drum solo in it i dont know the last time there was drum solo on one of our records im not really a keith moon drummer im a neanderthal im a basher i just stick to the backbeat
6127817 its ludicrous absolutely ludicrous coleen mcloughlin musnt have had any scent out that week or something
6127818 the broadsheets just took it and ran away with it how dare you say hip hop is not allowed at glastonbury
6127819 those people that write the newspapers they demand that rock stars dont have a big ego but when someone makes a flippant comment and it becomes a national issue what am i to think
6127820 well obviously everybody bearing that in mind can everyone go out and buy our new record when it comes out please im down to my last 4 million
6127821 i dont really remember a great deal about that interview to be honest
6127822 i have no recollection of actually being in the studio all i know is what i said was printed in the paper the next day
6127823 i kind of take my own disclaimer on that that morning if someone starts firing other peoples band names when youve been out all night drinking jager bombs
6127824 weve remixes done off this album by primal scream death in vegas richard fearless and producer jagz kooner

6127838 patriotism in my view does not mean unquestioning acceptance of whatever the government does to go along with whatever your government does is not a characteristic of democracy i remember in my own early education we were taught that it was a sign of a totalitarian state of a dictatorship when people did not question what their government did if you live in a democratic state it means you have the right to criticize your governments policies
6127839 this is the truth about the universe this is the way you ought to go

6127849 quando nonna avete lartrite e non poteva pi mettersi lo smalto nonno lo faceva per lei anche se aveva lartrite pure lui questo lamore
6127850 lo sai che ognuno ogni uomo vive perch qualcuno lo ama qualcuno prega per lui gli trasmette tutte le sue forze anche per te prega qualcuno per questo tu vivi
6127851 lamore quella cosa che ci fa sorridere quando siamo stanchi
6127852 non bisogna dire ti amo se non vero ma se vero bisogna dirlo tante volte le persone dimenticano
6127853 ci sono solo 4 domande che contano nella vita cosa sacro di cosa fatto lo spirito per cosa vale la pena vivere e per cosa vale la pena morire la risposta a ognuna la stessa solo lamore
6127854 the greatest thing youll ever learn is just to love and to let return
6127855 le sensazioni iniziali associate allinnamoramento sono come unondata oceanica nella loro intensit e agiscono da calamita per attirare due persone tra loro era possibile essere travolti dallemozione ma londata non durava non era nella natura delle cose per se due persone erano davvero adatte luna allaltra nella sua scia poteva nascere un amore pi sincero in grado di resistere al tempo
6127856 commettiamo gli errori pi grandi per amore e sono gli unici sbagli che siamo disposti a ripetere allinfinito

6127898 as a result of concerns about the child the parents had set up a video camera in the childs room
6127899 during the course of the evening the child was put to bed in its cot during the evening the defendant was seen to leave the party area and go to the toilet
6127900 he was followed by the childs father and he saw the defendant coming from the direction of the childs bedroom
6127901 the father went to the childs room and could see the child had vomited and was in a distressed state in the cot
6127902 when looking at the video later he saw the defendant strike the child five times while he was sleeping then leave the room quickly

6127926 my husband olaf gave me a winemaking kit for christmas in 2004
6127927 i was excited because i wanted to learn and intrigued that you could make your own wine that actually tastes good and its fairly easy i started making fruit wines and then grape wines
6127928 a guy in the twin cities who i only know as jerry the juiceman
6127929 i had to ask around learn how to make a simple syrup to get it right i was surprised at how well it turned out
6127930 last year we had a bonfire and drank it there with friends and it was terrible just terrible
6127931 we still entered them at the anoka county fair and i thought theyd put mr yuck stickers on them but they loved them sometimes it takes a good year to year and a half to know whether a fruit wine will be really good it can just turn overnight
6127932 you have to test it and you have to be cautious with sugar because you cant undo that if too much is added at any point
6127933 sometimes you have to wait a couple of years especially with grape wines
6127934 you can pick wild blackberries and wild raspberries forever and then go oh my i have 12 pounds to go
6127935 but the most labor intensive one was a dandelion wine because you pick and pick and pick its backbreaking work i get sore just thinking about it

6127946 sb 375 is of course sen darrell steinbergs bill that would implement the ab 32 greenhouse gas emissions reduction bill by tying state transportation and infrastructure money to regional plans to create sustainability communities it has been years since california planning amp development report has covered a bill this much
6127947 last year the bill got almost all the way through the legislature before steinberg pulled it at the last minute ever since it has been the focus of extensive negotiations among builders local governments and environmentalists last week proponents announced a deal had been done but this may have been wishful thinking
6127948 the reason for all this hullabaloo is that all the experts agree the state cant hit the greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets in ab 32 through technological fixes alone and that 10 15 of the solution has to come from changing growth patterns in a way that reduces overall driving this attention to land use has given smart growth advocates and environmentalists an opening in sacramento but its not something that builders or local governments really want to hear
6127949 we assume sb 375 will pass in some form setting off a frenzy of activity in california on how to implement the legislation but its worth noting that the whole ab 32 thing might be short lived no matter who is elected president in november its likely that a federal greenhouse gas reduction bill will pass that could override ab 32 even if there is no new federal legislation its likely that the next administration of whichever party will likely give california more leeway on technological solutions

6127976 nfs is getting pressure from clustered file systems like lustre and gpfs as well as custom file systems produced by web 2 0 service providers such as google gfs
6127977 even for files too small to stripe those files can be distributed across multiple nfs servers which provides statistical load balancing
6127978 with a capable cluster of nfs servers and a back end file system files or ranges within files can be relocated transparent to the applications accessing data over pnfs
6127979 pnfs moves the metadata server out of the data transfer path
6127980 instead of having to deal with a number of competing proprietary and open source parallel file systems pnfs will allow users to reap the benefits of parallel storage systems by choosing best of breed solutions without having concerns over vendor lock in
6127981 for environments that need improved performance for large sequential files where parallel access is needed pnfs has some legs moving forward
6127982 however not every environment or application needs parallel access to data
6127983 for mainstream markets pnfs will most likely remain a niche at least near term being used for specialized applications and environments
6127984 the big benefactors of pnfs will be the parallel file systems like those from ibm sun ibrix and others as well as proprietary storage systems like those from panasas
6127985 the architecture for the pnfs proposal was derived from the panasas directflow parallel protocol which is a core component utilized by the panasas panfs parallel file system
6127986 the directflow protocol used in our activestor parallel storage clusters currently provides essentially all of the functionality expected to be available in the nfs 4 1 later this year
6127987 going to 6g sas is the next natural evolutionary step for sas
6127988 while parallel scsi was limited to das environments sas brings new features that are opening up the possibility of sas in san like deployments which you might call scalable sharable das
6127989 such architectures are already being shipped in some blade systems today
6127990 further enhancements in 6gb s sas will make it even more attractive as a host interface for external storage moving forward
6127991 this includes a standardized zoning scheme and the removal of limitations in sas configurations
6127992 zoning may be used to hide disks or volumes from servers or computers that are not deliberately given access
6127993 this is a security feature and is similar to the fibre channel
6127994 6gb s sas should also be able to quickly replace parallel scsi as the preferred host attachment protocol for das
6127995 with the speed price and feature set offered by 6gb s sas this technology will become an attractive alternative to fc
6127996 3gb s sas is just now beginning to penetrate the host or front end interface of external raid subsystems in the lower price bands
6127997 i fully expect sas to continue to grow as both the host and drive interfaces of external storage
6127998 our electronic court records ecr system is a big time saver for kcdc employees and legal professionals who regularly access court records
6127999 the cost savings are huge because countless hours and reams of paper have been cut from the process
6128000 it required a huge amount of space to store our records
6128001 a lot of time was consumed hunting for physical files and moving them around the organization
6128002 every 12 hours the centera servers send me a report on how much data is on them and how much space is available
6128003 currently the total capacity for each is 9539 gb with remaining free capacity of 6038 gb on each one
6128004 some of our police agencies now report probable cause statements to the booking facility using their laptops or a kiosk in the jail and the prosecutor transmits them electronically to the emc information infrastructure
6128005 weve automated the process to the extent that human hands seldom have to touch paper documents and the documents themselves have never existed in paper
6128006 my next big project is to bring more tickets over into our digital system
6128007 we have to pay attention to various different mandated periods for document retention
6128008 centera can be set to automatically delete certain documents when they reach their end of life in compliance with policy and the applicable regulations
6128009 what is needed is a legally binding agreement not to use force mr saakashvili has repeatedly refused to sign such an agreement for reasons that have now become abundantly clear
6128010 the west would be wise to help achieve such an agreement now if instead it chooses to blame russia and re arm georgia as american officials are suggesting a new crisis will be inevitable in that case expect the worst
6128011 there is much talk now in the united states about rethinking relations with russia one thing that should definitely be rethought the habit of talking to russia in a condescending way without regard for its positions and interests
6128012 our two countries could develop a serious agenda for genuine rather than token cooperation many americans as well as russians understand the need for this but is the same true of the political leaders
6128013 there are now two great nations in the world which starting from different points seem to be advancing toward the same goal the russians and the anglo americans both have grown in obscurity and while the worlds attention was occupied elsewhere they have suddenly taken their place among the leading nations making the world take note of their birth and of their greatness almost at the same instant all other peoples seem to have nearly reached their natural limits and to need nothing but to preserve them but these two are growing the american fights against natural obstacles the russian is at grips with men the former combats the wilderness and barbarism the latter civilization with all its arms americas conquests are made with the plowshare russias with the sword to attain their aims the former relies on personal interest and gives free scope to the unguided strength and common sense of individuals the latter in a sense concentrates the whole power of society in one man one has freedom as the principal means of action the other has servitude their point of departure is different and their paths diverse nevertheless each seems called by some secret desire of providence one day to hold in its hands the destinies of half the world

6128021 there is a choice that has emerged in this campaign one that the american people need to understand they should ask themselves who got the single most important foreign policy decision since the end of the cold war right and who got it wrong this is not just a matter of debating the past its about who has the best judgment to make the critical decisions of the future

6128083 ive had a very detailed presentation from a number of different people from operation cougar which is a multi agency approach that is very creative very innovative and on the face of it having an effect with not a single gang related firearm incident since february
6128084 whilst there have been a small number of firearm incidents since february i am assured that none of those have been gang related
6128085 i genuinely think this operation is really innovative and what they have done is creative with a really strong multi agency partnership and absolute commitment from the top including local authorities and the police and involving schools
6128086 they are combining i think three important elements there is high visibility policing and a very large number of searches in fact they keep searching the same people they want the message to get across that if you have a knife or a gun you will get caught
6128087 the second element is disruption tactics preventing people going into areas like the recent moss side carnival
6128088 they simply prevent known gang members from going in to the carnival
6128089 and then theres early intervention in which the younger brothers and sisters of known gang members have been identified they have been visited and their parents engaged for the most part i am told parents have no idea what their children are up to
6128090 they are engaged in positive activities and there is support for their parents the whole focus is on trying to prevent that younger brother or sister going the same way by giving them an alternative and giving them the confidence to withstand the pressure to become involved in gang activities
6128091 we have put in place another programme working with 10 authorities of which greater manchester is one

6128094 we are increasing powers of schools and teachers to search pupils and also introducing knife referral projects in those 10 areas for children who are in possession of a knife but havent used it they will go into a youth referral project which will be very intensive indeed
6128095 if its polling as we usually think of polling merely soliciting an opinion no that doesnt require an independent expenditure report but if it becomes a push poll where the process tries to sway opinion that can certainly be considered an independent expenditure

6128439 why would pharmaceutical companies go to the expense and bother of conducting numerous trials with private physicians and a few of their patients rather than conduct large trials at medical centers to accomplish the same scientific results with greater efficiency
6128440 the true purpose is to get physicians in the habit of prescribing a new drug
6128441 physicians have a fiduciary obligation to ask questions on behalf of their patients as do institutional review boards and researchers which have the skill set and personnel to judge whether a trial is asking an already answered question
6128442 these games are not that easy and theyre getting tougher

6128452 based on data ive reviewed were patterning america only about a quarter late gdp in q2 slowed to 0 2 this year from 0 8 in q2 last year which is about the same deceleration rate as q2 in america
6128453 almost certainly gdp will be negative for q3 and i think the currency markets sense this and see a bank of england rate cut or two up ahead

6128509 i believe we all agree that exchange rates are at the heart of the funds mandate and that in this connection the fund must deliver good analysis and clear assessments with the ultimate aim of helping to focus the minds of policymakers and encouraging appropriate policy responses
6128510 it should be the membership as a whole through the executive board that engages with the member in determining whether a problem is of such magnitude that the imf needs to take a formal view on it and in persuading the member of policy changes that may be needed
6128511 consultative meeting on the oil and gas fiscal regime and fund types
6128512 the experiences of some resource rich developing countries suggest one thing growth and prosperity from oil discovery are not inevitable the irony in some cases is that the oil effect has been destabilising leading to low growth widespread inequalities and conflict the so called resource curse according to one expert the curse stands ready to capture new and unsuspecting economies that have weak institutions and poor standards of governance
6128513 the good news is that there are other countries that have grown and developed from their natural resources botswana with diamonds and norway and malaysia with oil are good examples
6128514 in fact many experts believe that the fiscal regime is what separates those economies where petroleum has made a difference to the overall living standards of citizens from where it has not

6128526 our darwin office closed six months ago and now we are losing all the rest it is difficult to see how we can possibly service remote areas such as queensland and the northern territory with the remaining staff
6128527 there used to be 10 technical staff in brisbane to look after southeast queensland now we have four and we have to cover all the areas handled by the closed offices
6128528 on top of that acma receives more than 8 million from the government to do digital television field strength measurements all over australia prior to the analogue switch off in 2013
6128529 this is to establish just what the problems are going to be and believe me there are some real problems
6128530 so far we have done about 1200 but they may have to be done again because there has been a rethink and there may have been a blunder in getting us to do the measurement at 2 5m antenna height instead of a more realistic height as found at most homes
6128531 unless this work is completed in time for translators and fill in transmitters to be installed there is a real risk that many thousands of people will be watching blank screens when analogue switches off
6128532 we have another team using new equipment replicating the tests done at 2 5m and the results they have been getting from their tests at a height of 10m show substantially the same results as the earlier readings
6128533 these cuts highlight the damage short sighted arbitrary efficiency dividend cuts can have
6128534 there are always unintended consequences and it appears in this instance that they may be very costly we are urging acma and the government to revisit this issue

6128553 i ray geisel did not say i was going to kill any president or senter obama
6128554 the nato declaration above all appears unobjective and biased because theres not a word about how all this started why it happened who started the aggressive action and who armed georgia
6128555 the behaviour of russia in this most recent conflict is isolating russia from the principles of co operation among nations
6128556 when you start invading smaller neighbours bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of its infrastructure that is isolating
6128557 it is not an act of the united states or the european union or anyone else to isolate russia
6128558 the federation council is ready to recognise the independent status of south ossetia and abkhazia if that is what the people of these republics want and also if there is a corresponding decision by the russian president
6128559 shes doing ok the thing thats really been hard about it is being away from her with all the traveling we have to do
6128560 its tough but at least racing gives me something i can deal with something im having some effect on i feel blessed to have racing
6128561 those guys have made a good transition and when you think about it somebody who qualified fifth or sixth at a certain race last year well theyre probably 10th or 11th now with the same time
6128562 ryan only ran six races last year so this is really his first full year in the indycar series and he is adapting and progressing pretty much as we had hoped
6128563 his win at watkins glen gave him the confidence in his ability that he needed to run up front with these guys and he has certainly been every bit as competitive as we expected he would be
6128564 at the same time he continues to learn every week about the tracks and the guys he is running with so i expect he will keep progressing and become a title contender
6128565 the best thing about having a one car team is that as a driver you can make the team your own
6128566 we challenged ryan to do that at the beginning of the year and he has stepped up and done it
6128567 he has had to make some adjustments in his mind set to tailor his approach to racing on ovals and he has made huge improvements in that area he has consistently shown his ability to run with the top guys in the series and can be considered a threat at every track we go to which is something that is very hard to do week in and week out in indycar after the unification
6128568 i guess i could have gone home and sat on the couch eating twinkies or something
6128569 but theres no certainty in racing even when youre doing a good job after that i just got into anything i could drive a1gp nascar testing daytona prototypes i think i did pretty well in all of them
6128570 ive always had 100 percent confidence in myself that i could win given the right race car and indycar racings where i want to be im only getting started is how i feel
6128571 were not necessarily happy with those results just because theyre top 10s
6128572 something happened in every one of those races that kept us from getting a better finish and weve got to get past that

6128583 at the end of the day it comes down to the athlete but when you have the best of everything looking after that athlete it definitely pays off and they the british have really set a standard now and a lot of countries wont be able to match that standard at all the funding just isnt there
6128584 i dont think money buys performance but it definitely helps with the fluency of the running of a program
6128585 you cant be too disappointed with a few fourths at the olympic games everyone would have loved to have come away with more medals but great britain has just proved their dominance that they did at the world championships great team with great backing and its up to the rest of the world now to try and match it

6128883 were so used to being in control of as much as we possibly can be
6128884 were used to having a choice and i think we will not be as meekly or helplessly set aside as we have perhaps imposed on our own elders
6128885 we do know from other studies that individuals who are in shorter term relationships are more likely to use a condom than individuals in longer term relationships
6128886 its possible that youth between the ages of 18 and 19 year olds are in longer term relationships and therefore they perceive their risk for sexually transmitted disease infection to be lower and so unfortunately theyre not using a condom

6128903 the afghan people have long doubted such claims of foreigners especially of britain and america and their trust about crushing al qaeda and terrorism has fallen
6128904 the people have the right to think that there is something in the wind

6128907 when you put more police on the streets when you have specific initiatives designed to go after specific types of offences those are two of many circumstances that result in increased numbers
6128908 at one time you would never hear of a robbery a daylight robbery at a bank was unheard of
6128909 now nobody gets too excited about it knocking off a macs milk store thats more common today than it was years ago
6128910 people do move here to get away from the city because they feel when theyre in the city youve got more violence more crimes and more of a chance of getting hurt
6128911 times have changed and were trying to keep up with them
6128912 it challenges the myth that cities are violent and rural areas are not
6128913 in huron county they were totally outraged because the people were such fine upstanding citizens they didnt deserve a death like that
6128914 people feel like theyve really been intruded upon because its not the way of life up here
6128915 its really a country feeling we have people come here because they want out of the rat race and a slower pace
6128916 its almost like an arms war at one point in time a good old fashioned fist fight may have been the way differences were sorted out
6128917 the increase in violence goes hand in hand with the need to arm oneself to have the advantage if you want to have the upper hand you go with the biggest gun guns are in the hands of young people and thats because they are actively seeking them
6128918 all kinds of crime is going on but it only becomes officially crime when police charge someone
6128919 it does depend upon the focus of police with weapons charges it might relate to a concentrated focus of police activity
6128920 instead what were seeing is a steady trend line up
6128921 what weve done is moved the crime up along various highways out of the gta and weve moved it into some of these communities where theyve never heard of anybody being arrested with a gun now its routine its had a devastating impact
6128922 we need a guns and gangs initiative thats pan provincial that really understands that handgun and gang activity is as dangerous in small town and rural ontario as it is in toronto
6128923 were trying not to provoke them otherwise theyll stay here for five to six months
6128924 both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increase and needs to increase sooner rather than later
6128925 this is a moment in history when it is vital for the worlds democracies to stand in solidarity
6128926 this is not only a heinous act but tantamount to selling the countrys sovereignty and independence to another nation it is shameful utterly humiliating to every pakistani
6128927 it is high time that the present government act like an independent sovereign nation and form its own foreign policy leaving behind the legacy of a discredited military dictator
6128928 based on the testimony of detainees held in bagram in 2003 and 2004 it is clear that there was a woman being held at the base whether or not that woman was aafia siddiqi is something that at the moment cannot be verified
6128929 however dr siddiqi has confirmed that she was held in bagram for years
6128930 i fear for her life they probably dont want her to see the light of day
6128931 a close look at the picture in newspapers here shows the years of torture dark circles under her eyes a broken and badly fixed nose made up teeth and crumbled lips it is a picture of a severely dehydrated and unwell person almost as if on the deathbed it shows the inhumane brutality of a civilised nation by the administration of the country which claims to be civilised
6128932 she was suffering from multiple bullet wounds that had been not been attended to she came to court in a wheelchair and was suffering from intense abdominal pain for which she was given aspirin which could only act as poison for her ulcerous condition
6128933 my brother told me he saw the perpetrators and the victim together in one room there was not a shred of compassion just stony eyed hate
6128934 you know it would have been better if she had died i believed she had died and was reconciled to the idea that way i could move on and then she re surfaced like resurrected from the dead and that brought some hope but seeing her like this it just breaks my heart
6128935 after seeing aafias pictures splashed in newspapers across the country and the torture marks she bore for five years i fear for my husbands life too
6128936 but being a woman and a mother whose children have been separated from her i can feel the torment shes going through
6128937 to say that she aafia had been taken into custody only on jul 17 2008 is a blatant lie as transparently ugly as any falsehood can be the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of truth an affront to peoples commonsense
6128938 we consider dr aafias case an instance of utterly unconscionable and most brutal form of attack on a human beings individual rights
6128939 the hrcp had been calling for her recovery since 2003 and when it went to the supreme court in 2007 her name was high on the list the only mystery was the silence of aafias family
6128940 all these years we were told by various government people that she was alright and is well and not to probe too much or harm would come to her
6128941 president yoshimi yasuda chose not only to violate this agreement but also turned defiant telling me if you are dissatisfied with the decision not to pay the bonuses either quit the company or sue it

6128952 georgian troops were supposed to conduct land and air attacks in the unrecognized republic of abkhazia to enter its capital sukhumi other documents that we have testify to the fact that the information which georgia obtained with the help of unmanned aerial aircraft was distributed among all commanders of georgian units

6129073 the relationship between the state attorney general and the offices of local prosecutors sheriffs and police is among the most complicated in public life and its strengths or weakness can result in real life heroics or tragedies

6129120 dank an ministerin sommer dass sie die schwierigkeiten an einigen gymnasien und gesamtschulen nicht weiter ignoriert
6129121 in bekannter polemik wird dies nat rlich medienwirksam kontra gesamtschule interpretiert
6129122 die schulministerin betont dass es ihr bei aller kritik nicht um die abschaffung der gesamtschulen geht wir sehen dies als klares bekenntnis zur gesamtschuloberstufe und werden sie beim wort nehmen
6129123 wer die abiturientenquote erh hen will darf das nadel hr nicht verengen

6129126 die landesregierung hat mit dem neuen schulgesetz alle register gezogen damit gesamtschulen das leben erschwert wird und das gymnasium seinen sonderstatus als elitekaderschule beh lt dass die ergebnisse der zentralen pr fungen die bindende grundschulempfehlung und das g8 den gesamtschulen

6129148 i think it would cause more problems for us i think a lot of people now choose not to drink because its against the law wed just have a lot more problems if more students were drinking
6129149 i signed the statement in hopes that it would encourage debate on our campus about the seriousness of drinking in general but more importantly the high risk drinking that has become so common on college campuses today
6129150 do they remember what happened the last time the age was lowered we drove the drinking problems farther down to the younger ages
6129151 this is the colleges saying that by making it legal we dont have to worry about it rather than dealing with the problems
6129152 you can wipe out the illegality overnight but not the problems
6129153 the best argument is that if theyre old enough to fight a war theyre old enough to drink i understand that thats a social justice issue
6129154 my concern is they havent lived on their own and havent faced decisions that after a couple of years in college they can better deal with
6129155 these are very young people they are adults but theyre very young adults
6129156 i cant imagine the added problems by having so many more students legally drinking
6129157 we need serious sustained unfettered debate about the drinking age and the reality of life on a college campus and how these two things are aligned
6129158 we must engage in civil informed and dispassionate debate and consider all policy alternatives no matter how controversial
6129159 theres a lot of things that i think make the debate timely
6129160 whether its our kids giving their lives at 18 to save this country i think the issues about voting and responsibility to vote
6129161 colleges already have kids drinking that are 18 19 20 so why not make it legal
6129162 i think people should consider lowering the drinking age and increase the driving age
6129163 i think there are certain circumstances where people are responsible at 18 to drink
6129164 barack obamas tax cuts for ordinary americans are three times larger than john mccains
6129165 the way that john mccains package ends up being three to four trillion dollars more is that they give humungous tax cuts to high income people and large corporations
6129166 in this economy in the past six months with over 400 000 jobs lost weve seen the small businesses those with less than 50 employees add 283 000 jobs
6129167 keep them in a position where they dont have onerous health care costs and mandates to provide expensive benefits to their employees
6129168 it is the mentality of the past eight years to listen to the oil companies that got us into this mess and we have to have a different energy policy to get out of it
6129169 john mccain believes that we have a dangerous exposure to imported oil
6129170 it is his primary objective to put the united states in a position where it is no longer strategically exposed by this dependence
6129171 the first and foremost objective is to change the way americans drive

6129181 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

6129187 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6129188 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6129189 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6129190 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6129191 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6129192 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6129193 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6129194 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6129195 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking

6129200 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6129201 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6129202 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6129203 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

6129292 the only thing ukraines army is basically able to do is march down kyivs main street khreshchatyk for a military parade thats it
6129293 what happened in georgia is the best example how easily military actions and questions of territorial integrity can in todays condition be forced upon a country that does not have collective security guarantees
6129294 then that means we are on verge of deep and serious military actions

6129296 welfare sovereignty and independence are impossible to defend at this moment
6129297 while we use second and third generation tanks nato members use tanks and aviation of the fourth and fifth generation

6129304 the 2008 report shows some states and communities have taken positive steps but overall we are not treating the obesity epidemic with the seriousness it deserves
6129305 this is the fifth annual report and with each and every year we see more evidence the obesity epidemic is gaining speed and destructive force
6129306 the resources devoted to improving the health of our families and our children remain too few and too ineffective
6129307 the federal government continues to cut its own effective programs at the federal level the only obesity number going down is the number of dollars being spent to end the epidemic

6129395 but i want to play for as long as i can at as high a level as i can and that means a return to the spl
6129396 he is still registered with vancouver whitecaps in canada and it is a problem we are trying to overcome
6129397 their season ends after our transfer window closes and were trying to find a way round that
6129398 if we bring in zibi or vito it would be on a loan deal at least initially
6129399 in making our decision we have to balance our finances with whats best for the team
6129400 we had a look at him on tuesday and asked him back on friday
6129401 we have not got to the stage of discussing a fee but we have to decide whether we want him and will give him a decision by the end of the week
6129402 but the harsh reality is that we didnt take our chances when they came along
6129403 the players are despondent because they have competed for most of the game but were let down in the vital areas
6129404 we will strive to teach them how to deal with better players because they havent been at this level before
6129405 i have been speaking to the players for weeks and weeks about the step up to this level
6129406 and at the back we didnt do enough to deal with falkirk especially for the first two goals
6129407 the potential is there but today we have been dealt a harsh lesson
6129408 well looking at that i dont think thats the actions of a sane man coming to an spl team at two oclock in the biggest game of their career and trying to do what
6129409 i think thats him trying to get a bit of attention for himself
6129410 david is taking the team now and that is it he has been taking pre season bringing players in and taking training so he is the manager
6129411 i would advise him rowan on my behalf to stay well away from the club because at this time we dont need these distractions
6129412 today leo martin called jim gemmell who in turn promised to speak with brooks mileson hopefully passing on the message that we would be happy to travel to gretna for a meeting on tuesday
6129413 mr gemmell did not respond so a fax was also sent requesting a meeting to clarify the clubs intentions regarding my position
6129414 again while the club have managed to issue a press statement we have not received a response from mr gemmell or the club as promised
6129415 as was previously stated if gretna would prefer my solicitor to be in contact directly with their solicitors then we are happy to proceed in that direction
6129416 rowan alexanders attendance was clearly intended to bring the name of the club into disrepute as demonstrated by his prepared press statement and was also in breach of an agreement between himself and the club that he refrain from attendance until his own situation at the club has been resolved
6129417 to that end and following a meeting with himself and his agent kevin drinkell on 25 june the club wrote to him on 26 june spoke to him on 29 june and wrote to him again on 11 july and 1 august
6129418 as at todays date we have still not been afforded the courtesy of a reply from him and therefore the club totally refutes any suggestion that delays in resolving his situation have been caused by the club
6129419 today as the manager of gretna fc i attended fir park motherwell to do the job i am contracted to do
6129420 my representative kevin drinkell and my solicitor mr leo martin have made numerous and repeated attempts to clarify and resolve my situation currently with gretna fc without success
6129421 as a friendly suggestion from brooks mileson i took some time away from my role
6129422 throughout there has been nothing medically wrong with me however i have been requested by the club to stay away
6129423 do it just like that and in a week or so your skin will be all clear
6129424 but if you make it to september and keep putting this on your forehead i think youll be happy with the improvement you see in your skin
6129425 i was nearly knocked down there once so when the police van went the wrong way i sort of said hey mate no entry but he just shouted out of the window expletive off this is police business
6129426 it was very frightening all i had done was photograph these police officers doing something illegal but i was the one who ended up being arrested

6129433 we are hopeful that debus will keep in mind the need for justice

6129437 we are saying that we will not hand over any sudanese citizens to anyone for prosecution abroad

6129441 first they falsely attacked pearces primary opponent now its tom udall
6129442 on energy tom udall says do it all more domestic drilling including some offshore nuclear power and alternative energy like wind and solar
6129443 steve pearce voted against alternative energy nine times thats why he got hundreds of thousand dollars from big oil
6129444 the same ideological billionaires from texas new york and new jersey are back with more fraudulent and misleading attack ads this time attempting to smear tom udalls record of doing whats right
6129445 steve pearces out of state accomplices whose swift boat style ads drove senator to spurn their misleading and unfair attacks in the primary are once again trying to prop up his struggling campaign and influence this election
6129446 billionaires from new york and new jersey are trying to buy senator domenicis seat in order to satisfy their narrow ideological agenda and they have found a perfect accomplice in steve pearce
6129447 at which point i swiped a hand across my upper lip and discovered the real issue
6129448 even though nebraska has one of the lowest corn checkoff rates in the country nebraska corn producers put more resources into promoting the livestock industry than any other state
6129449 our commitment to the u s meat export federation and our promotions of nebraska beef and pork around the world are a testament of our partnership with the livestock industry
6129450 weve also helped make nebraska a leading state for the understanding and use of the corn ethanol co product distillers grains
6129451 more people around the world move into the middle income bracket each year china and india have moved 300 million people into the middle income bracket which is more than the entire population of the united states
6129452 this gives us a great opportunity to meet the growing demand for protein around the world
6129453 thats costing the u s beef industry about 50 million a week
6129454 just think if we can regain that last 40 percent and the revenue that would generate for nebraska cattle producers
6129455 these kinds of investments make a difference and translate into more sales of u s meat and better prices for livestock producers
6129456 no other state is as well situated to take advantage of this combination as nebraska
6129457 early in the game they made a lot of tough shots
6129458 we were doing what we were supposed to be doing and they made tough shots but sooner or later well impose our will i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6129459 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat
6129460 theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend
6129461 theyre a force to be reckoned with they caused us a lot of problems
6129462 in the third quarter we said the first three or four minutes we need to pick it up a little bit defensively and make the extra pass offensively
6129463 if you read what i just read you would relapse and kick a puppy if he stood between you and a pack of marlboro lights

6129468 davis started his pro career late when he was 29
6129469 sometimes a long amateur career takes a beating on a fighters body but so far davis has done well for his age 36 and obviously hes taken good care of his body some younger fighters have underestimated him thinking that due to his age hes slower than he really is im taking him seriously though preparing to fight him at his peak not thinking about his age at all

6129507 we told the airlines we would allow them if someone gave a birth date to exclude that person from the list
6129508 let the person get their boarding pass directly at home or at the kiosk just like everyone else some airlines have done this some have chosen not to because they dont want to spend the money
6129509 and their attitude is well tsa gets the blame for it so i guess if they can do what they are doing now with food and can charge you for it but i hate to suggest that i may give them an idea
6129510 we are now awaiting tsas announced january 2009 implementation of the secure flight program which is expected to reduce the number of misidentified passengers
6129511 in the meantime the airlines worked collaboratively with tsa to further minimize unnecessary passenger inconvenience a key part of that short term solution relies on frequent flier program enrollment to help resolve misidentification issues and as a result we are urging passengers to enroll

6129519 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
6129520 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
6129521 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
6129522 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
6129523 i have tried until today and i am not sure if i have fully understood what the philosopher meant
6129524 it is easier doing business in hong kong than in ghana
6129525 if that was the case how come all of you are rushing here away from hong kong
6129526 we are in the third premises since seven years every year the owner of the building comes and he wants more money from us we pay but he is not satisfied it makes everything so uncertain
6129527 in hong kong you pay just three months rent in advance and then the regular monthly rent if you intend leaving at anytime and you have smeared the walls or caused some more serious damage the three months rent covers it or you pay any additional costs if that is not the case you get your deposit back in hong kong you enter a fully furnished office except you want to change something yourself
6129528 the rent from one year to three or five years advance that is collected from you hardly gives the satisfaction you expect
6129529 in seoul s korea you want your restaurant placed some twenty kilometers away from town center and your customers are grateful for the fresh air and lower prices because you pay small tenancy

6129532 what we havent had is the political will to raise the taxes necessary to make these high payoff public investments
6129533 the idea that every dollar collected in taxes is a dollar lost from the economy is nothing but political propaganda
6129534 my philosophy is simple i like the world of music and there i think global because you have to let

6129536 steve has had a little bit of a setback nothing major
6129537 we hoped he would be training this week but it looks likely to be next monday now
6129538 i do not know much but i have also heard about it
6129539 there was a guy who rang me and told me about rangers but i referred them only to my agent martin dahlin
6129540 after that i have not heard anything at all people are calling me about many things but i let martin take care of any items
6129541 this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
6129542 baa has argued that there is no scope for competition to develop so long as there are capacity constraints we take the opposite view unless the market is opened up to competition there is a serious risk that the current capacity constraints will persist
6129543 we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counter productive
6129544 we are very pleased that the competition commission has recognised what is a fundamental problem for uk airports
6129545 last night the eye actually skirted st lucie county we were on the southside of the eye
6129546 it actually became stationary last night at one point and thats the reason why we have so much water today we thought wed get maybe 4 or 5 inches of rain with this weather and we got closer to 15

6129552 private lavena johnsons death is one in a disturbing pattern of cases where female soldiers have been raped and killed with the military either obscuring the truth or conveniently labeling the deaths suicides
6129553 congress now faces pressure to act with more than 50 000 colorofchange members joining the johnson family as they call on congress to hold the military accountable for these hidden tragedies

6129556 you always like a dress rehearsal being a scrimmage where were flying around were not making mistakes and were closer to where we want to be before we play michigan state
6129557 were getting close and tomorrow will be one more opportunity for guys to show what they can do and then from there we have to create a depth chart
6129558 its always important to produce and thats something thats continual as far as monitoring and making sure that people are doing their jobs and making plays
6129559 i felt like the energy was good and the hustle was good
6129560 we werent as sharp as we need to be offensively we had noise and we had guys flinching so that was not good but besides that everything else was fine everybody stayed healthy through it and we got some situations done
6129561 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
6129562 john mccain now looks like hes had a lot of botox to paralyze his frown and worry lines on his forehead id also say that hes had some laser treatments to lessen the broken capillaries and diminish age spots

6129568 he gives us the flexibility to do a lot of different things
6129569 we have a lot of backs so were not going to have one guy take 500 reps in a game were going to spread the wealth but well definitely find ways to get him the ball

6129571 i had had that bike since high school and over 10 000 miles on it
6129572 i have many people in portland who i would consider my friend now
6129573 that day was a really bad day but after that i kept having awesome experiences with great people
6129574 i think that the reason that my bike was stolen just shows that there is a strong market for it in the city

6129579 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires
6129580 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
6129581 we have emphasized the point going back to bernays that reference to mathematical objects is relative to a background structure
6129582 parsonss structuralist account of a particular kind of mathematical object does not view statements about that kind of object as about structures at all
6129583 you know chuck i might have to get out of the navy
6129584 i was still in the dive i had just started to pull out and got hit by a surface to air missile and it basically took the wing off the aircraft
6129585 and so i was gyrating very violently almost straight down so i had to eject very quickly
6129586 then we all pushed him here to the edge of the lake and the security forces surrounded him at that point everyone in the village was here everyone came down to see the american pilot
6129587 would you like him to be president of the united states
6129588 that depends on the u s people i dont know
6129589 he would never admit the united states made a mistake in the war therefore i say john mccain is an extremely conservative man he was loyal to his ideology
6129590 i wasnt as tough as i had hoped to be and i certainly wasnt as strong as some of my comrades
6129591 there was a correlation between my refusal to accept early release and my treatment
6129592 because after it was clear to the vietnamese i would not do that then the treatment got very much worse
6129593 i think in many ways it was harder on him than it was on me
6129594 this is not true because our nation is civilized and humanitarian and you do not understand the vietnamese nation
6129595 i had my front teeth knocked out i had my cheekbone broken i had my nose broken
6129596 beaten with a fan belt for three of four days

6129600 we thought wed be home for christmas of 69 and there we were and there we were for three more christmases 70 71 and 72

6129602 the united states condemns the recent terrorist attacks in algeria the most recent ones today and yesterday
6129603 we will continue to stand with the people of algeria the president offers his sincere condolences to the families who lost loved ones and to the people of algeria
6129604 these criminals and thugs must be stopped and the united states will continue working with algeria in close cooperation on counterterrorism measures
6129605 we are very close kilinochchi is not very far from our sight
6129606 you really have to appreciate what the services are doing at the moment
6129607 they are doing a great job a great job i would say even though there are ups and downs the achievements are great
6129608 they did not have defenses in that area so they could not prepare themselves to face the military threat
6129609 the troops are confident the soldiers are confident the army commander is confident
6129610 this silence is not good for the troops at all

6129621 our engineers have put together an incredible processing family here that will include a tremendous amount of new processor features all centered on delivering faster computer performance and terrific energy efficiency
6129622 today we look at a pair of cases first up is the lian li pc x500 also known as the tyr pc x500 which is the most unusual the pc x500 is a tall tower but less deep than most in order to fit into a tighter floor footprint achieving that goal required some interesting design decisions such as the sideways mounted optical drive bays lian li suggests that the pc x500 might be a good case for a home theater pc sitting unobtrusively alongside that hdtv alternatively it could be a good case for gamers it is not on the other hand inexpensive at 400 the pc k1 is a more conventional tower case aimed squarely at gamers built in a steel skeleton with an aluminum skin the pc k1 is more rigid than most all aluminum cases but substantially lighter than a purely steel design both cases are unusual enough that we built entire systems into them to get a better feel for how easy these cases are to work with and how well they integrate into a home environment
6129623 will extreme overclocking help nvidia geforce 9800 gtx to defeat ati radeon hd 4800 and how greatly will an extremely overclocked geforce 9800 gtx be able to complete against the new geforce gtx 260 answers to all these questions in our new article
6129624 the corsair tw3x2g2133c9df memory kit is a very impressive memory kit that was found to be 100 stable at these insane clock frequencies running at 2133mhz is no joke and its still beyond what most platforms today are capable of running to be honest the nforce 790i sli is pushed nearly to its limits running memory this fast
6129625 through the last few years bfg has always been at the forefront of the pre overclocked craze and with their ocx cards they take things to the next level we should mention now that in our conversations with bfg they have stated that creating a highly overclocked gtx 280 isnt as easy as it seems due to the massive amounts of heat generated by the core directly influencing the final overclock that being said in this review we will be looking at their gtx 280 ocx which is highest clocked gtx 280 in their lineup that keeps the stock cooler
6129626 msi brings us their k9n2 based on nvidias 780a chipset does being able to turn off that power hungry video card get your attention on paper this board has a lot to offer but how does it work in the real world

6129628 six months later gateway and best buy are teaming up again with an upgraded version of the p 6831 we are still working on a larger laptop roundup but we felt it would be beneficial to alert our readers to the availability of this amazing value sooner rather than later we will have additional details as part of the roundup for now we present some initial benchmark results and an overview of the upgrades
6129629 according to an interview on bit tech asus claims that theyll be the first motherboard manufacturer to have an x58 board with sli support thanks to the nforce 200 chipset from nvidia what is interesting to note is that asus is also planning to launch a sku without the nvidia chip which according to the information weve heard means that asus wouldnt get a discount from nvidia when it comes to the nforce 200 chips asus is expecting to ship the standard x58 models first with the nforce 200 models to turn up somewhat later bit tech asked when asus expected to have x58 boards in the market but due to ndas asus declined to answer but mentioned that their motherboards will be available sometime in q4 this year other good news on the subject of the x58 platform is that asus said that the entire platform was a lot more mature than they expected and that theyve had next to no problems making their x58 based motherboards

6129631 the first intel socket lga1366 heatsinks have landed in the frostytech labs from a well known heatsink company whose name we cant mention and we expect to have a full collection of lga1366 heastink reviews shortly in the mean time answers to questions like 1 will current intel socket 775 heatsinks fit on intel socket 1366 motherboards 3 do nehalem socket 1366 heatsinks use the plastic push pin clips or something new 2 if i use a socket 775 to 1366 adaptor bracket to make my existing intel heatsink fit onto a socket 1366 motherboard is that okay
6129632 the other day we looked at the smooth creations asylum and inside was the new diamond hd 4870 xoc black edition this isnt your normal overclocked hd 4870 though if you have a look at the specifications on the thing you will quickly discover that the card is packing some mega serious clock speeds so what weve done is pull the card out of the smooth creations rig and install it into our testbed to see how the card performs against some of our other favorites since this wasnt a retail sample we wont be looking at the package today what we will do is have a quick look around the card and then check out the clockspeeds before moving onto the testing phase

6129642 i do not know much but i have also heard about it
6129643 there was a guy who rang me and told me about rangers but i referred them only to my agent martin dahlin
6129644 after that i have not heard anything at all people are calling me about many things but i let martin take care of any items
6129645 egregio signore vedo che lei ha sollevato dei punti interessanti sui modelli climatici dellipcc purtroppo per devo dirle che ha fatto un errore fondamentale un errore purtroppo molto comune lei si basa su un imperfezione dei modelli per sostenere che la co2 non causa riscaldamento sbagliato non a questo che servono i modelli che la co2 causi un riscaldamento dellatmosfera un fatto fisico nessun modello dellatmosfera potrebbe provare o smentire un fatto che deriva dalle propriet fisiche della molecola di co2 ovvero dalla sua capacit di assorbire la radiazione infrarossa questa una cosa nota da pi di un secolo e che si misura in laboratorio vorrebbe negarla
6129646 le faccio un semplice esempio supponiamo che lei accenda un caminetto in una stanza lei sa che un fatto fisico che la fiamma riscalder la stanza ora se le chiedessi di prevedere esattamente che temperatura la stanza raggiunger lei avr bisogno di qualche modello probabilmente piuttosto complicato che tenga conto dellisolamento termico dei doppi vetri della circolazione dellaria nella stanza e di tante altre cose un buon modello le dar una previsione approssimata pu darsi benissimo tuttavia che non riesca a prevedere al decimo di grado la temperatura della stanza o esattamente la temperatura di ogni parte della stanza ora dal fatto che il modello non da previsioni esatte lei andrebbe a concludere che il fuoco non scalda la stanza
6129647 vede quindi che le imprecisioni dei modelli non sono un motivo per negare leffetto del riscaldamento dei gas serra che ripeto un fatto fisico certamente non sappiamo con precisione assoluta di quanto la terra si riscalder a causa del biossido di carbonio ma lei sa anche o dovrebbe sapere che la concentrazione di biossido di carbonio nellatmosfera la pi alta mai osservata su questo pianeta da quasi un milione di anni a questa parte e sta continuando ad aumentare vorrebbe dirci che non ce ne dobbiamo preoccupare semmai le imprecisioni dei modelli sono un motivo per preoccuparci di pi i modelli infatti potrebbero essere ottimisti e il riscaldamento globale potrebbe essere molto pi dannoso di quanto non prevedano
6129648 nei periodi nei quali la temperatura al suolo ha continuato a salire e quindi anche le temperature troposferiche avrebbero dovuto mostrare un trend di crescita ben definito
6129649 beh questo non prova che il modello funziona potrebbe essere fortuna

6129651 this report and release are as deceptive as some of the advertising and marketing of consumer products prosecuted by the federal trade commission and state attorneys general there is a clear and present danger that municipal and state decision makers as well as parents and citizens will rely on this unconscionably deficient report it is replete with unsound scientific methodology and conclusions and unreliable findings it may lead to unsupportable and unwise commitments by towns and cities or their boards of education to build or replace athletic fields i have personally reached no conclusion on the safety or health issues concerning artificial turf because no complete or comprehensive study has been done this one far from being complete or comprehensive is profoundly misleading and misguided and may lead to bad policymaking timely corrective action indeed immediate revision is essential
6129652 the cpsc review of artificial turf safety focused entirely on the issue of lead contamination from artificial blades of grass there is no indication that cpsc staff considered the transferability or emission especially at high temperatures of toxic chemicals from the crumb rubber used at the base of artificial turf
6129653 there is no indication that cpsc considered other important risks some presented or aggravated by very high temperatures in the summer sun and exposure to serious infection caused by the more extensive skin burns and abrasions created by falls on this material further while cpsc staff admits that aging wear and exposure to sunlight may change the amounts of chemicals released cpsc has not even attempted to study or quantify the effects of those changes on health and safety
6129654 even as to the lead issue the cspc study is seriously and reprehensibly flawed the study evaluated only 14 samples of artificial turf even though thousands of these fields are in use worse six samples were from portions of turf that was never installed or used and one sample came from a field that was no longer in use thus only half of the samples or seven were from turf in current use it is mystifying and mindboggling that an agency charged with protecting our children from unsafe products would declare artificial turf ok to install ok to play on without studying these critical health and safety threats

6129662 esa es la idea estamos con dos puntos menos con relaci n a las dos eliminatorias anteriores y eso nos obliga a buscar los puntos que se han resignado en casa ahora jugando de visitantes vamos a trabajar para lograrlo
6129663 siempre son partidos bonitos y atractivos que les sirven a los t cnicos para hacerse una idea de cara a los compromisos de las eliminatorias a fin del presente mes hay concentraci n y la idea nuestra es estar en sud frica
6129664 en esa preparaci n nos vamos a enfrentar con un equipo como colombia en un juego m s de los tantos que hemos jugado y buscando encontrar un buen nivel para los partidos oficiales
6129665 colombia va por buen camino es una de las dos selecciones invictas en el torneo no conocen la derrota han conseguido puntos por fuera que es bueno para las aspiraciones de un mundial
6129666 as que esperemos que por ser naciones vecinas ser a importante y fabuloso estar en sud frica cada una debe pelear lo suyo y hacer lo necesario para estar ah ojal que lo podamos lograr
6129667 argentina y brasil son potencias que siempre est n en la fiesta grande adem s paraguay hace una buena campa a el f tbol se ha equiparado mucho y cualquiera puede ganar y sacar sus resultados lo bueno del caso es las cosas a n est n abiertas y no hay que olvidarse de nadie
6129668 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates and weve been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6129669 there is virtually no prospect of this animal being real
6129670 we wouldnt know what we were doing if we did
6129671 a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6129672 later that day tom biscardi informed us that both matthew whitton and ricky dyer admitted it was a costume
6129673 at this time action is being instigated against the perpetrators
6129674 is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived by this deception
6129675 requested an undisclosed sum of money as an advance expected from the marketing and promotion
6129676 sorry that my name and stanfords name have been brought into this
6129677 but i cant imagine why anyone would devote their lives to proving the existence of bigfoot anything has a remote chance of being true but there is virtually no prospect of this animal being real

6129680 it will capture the hearts of readers of all ages
6129681 capitalism at its heart is a brutal nasty economic system
6129682 the point is its not always consistent there can be examples of people who have more power less money
6129683 the rich have gotten richer you cant argue the poor their incomes only gone up 2 5 percent
6129684 economists are going to tell you its going to take young people longer to get their middle class lifestyle than their parents
6129685 the other thing is you have to pay for your education
6129686 access to all this credit has essentially served the purpose of putting middle class in peasantry
6129687 mom and dad saved money to do things they didnt use credit now we have an economy based on credit but its not free you have to pay it back
6129688 something had to be done to set up the economy
6129689 theyre having to work harder and longer for it seems less pay but who do they hold accountable
6129690 when the government says we created jobs we dont say really
6129691 every politician would say they represent the middle class but the middle class has to ask do they really represent the middle class or someone else
6129692 where do they go are they going to be invited to the upper class
6129693 i think its in the interest of the rich to make sure some of those resources are shared the worse case scenario is revolt and they dont want that
6129694 more and more you need two incomes to achieve that middle class lifestyle
6129695 but so far we havent seen anything except for promises
6129696 we dont know how to live on and nobody talks about it
6129697 ive been using this service for at least three years it was so easy i would press a buzzer to open my front gate and the driver would come in my driveway is perfectly safe and only slopes down by about an inch
6129698 on april 10 one of the drivers mentioned he had gone over on his ankle i asked him if he was okay and he said yes mate no problem he carried on unloading the bags from the van and seemed fine so i thought no more of it the deliveries continued for three months with no problems until i suddenly got a solicitors letter out of the blue telling me the driver was suing me because he had injured his ankle after falling on my drive
6129699 stepped into a sunken part of the block paved driveway
6129700 the reason why we are alleging fault is that you failed to maintain the driveway and caused or permitted areas of the driveway immediately in front of the gate to sink and form a depression within the driveway into which our client has stepped and which has caused his injury
6129701 and you who were already conquered in your greatest victories what will you be in the approaching defeat
6129702 its not in the spirit of our national day if we go ahead with the concert it is contrary to what we are preparing for
6129703 we asked them to find another date as the original date is so close to the independence day thats the only reason
6129704 considered too sexy for us we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance

6129715 if we consider mankind as a whole and substitute it for a single individual we discover that it too has developed delusions which are inaccessible to logical criticism and which contradict reality if in spite of this they the delusions are able to exert an extraordinary power over men investigation leads us to the same explanation as in the case of the single individual they owe their power to the element of historical truth which they have brought up from the repression of the forgotten and primeval past

6129727 selective cox 2 inhibitors were thought to be a promising medicine in treating neurodegenerative diseases stroke cancers and inflammation related diseases like arthritis however the occurrence of a series of cardiovascular complications in patients receiving cox 2 inhibitors has led to their recent withdrawal from the market and limits on their usages our research has shown that the use of endogenous cannabinoid 2 ag may avoid such side effects therefore elevation of endogenous 2 ag levels by facilitating its production inhibiting its decomposition or directly supplying 2 ag may result in treatment advances to prevent the devastation of disorders like stroke alzheimers and traumatic brain injury

6129730 large companies are putting together server farms of tens of thousands of computers even approaching 100 thousand and the big challenge is to interconnect all these computers so that they can talk to each other as quickly as possible without incurring significant costs
6129731 we are proposing a new topology for ethernet data center connectivity
6129732 our work addresses the problem of data center network connectivity in a world where consolidation is increasingly taking place in data centers
6129733 the history of computing and technology has an innumerable set of examples where commodity parts take over the functionality of more specialized pieces of equipment
6129734 but that commoditization hasnt taken place on the communications side so we do have these specialized components still living in the network infrastructure that incur significant costs and complexity
6129735 the other issue is that people are treating the data center as a mini internet
6129736 thats fine but they are then forced to use the same components they might use in the wide area network with a bunch of concerns that dont come up in the data center environment adversarial environments attacks parties that might not trust each other etc so you have a lot of functionalities in these specialized switching components that you really dont need in your data center and you wind up paying for it in dollars and in complexity
6129737 independent of whether our technique is successful or someone elses is five years from now switching and communication infrastructure in the datacenter will be based on these small commodity building blocks
6129738 one of the big benefits of our approach is that it scales trivially to 10 gige at the edge whereas competing techniques rely on aggregation to ever faster links to achieve higher speeds
6129739 if you were to go to 10 gige at the edge for servers today you would need to aggregate to 40 gige or 100 gigelinks moving up the tree topology unfortunately the 40gbps ethernet standard isnt even out yet and when it does become available it will be very expensive because were using identical network elements in our topology today 48 port 10 gige ethernet switches are becoming relatively inexpensive so we would scale trivially to that environment as well
6129740 from a cost perspective to build out a 25 000 node cluster today using current techniques with 100 percent bandwidth just the switching equipment would cost somewhere in the order of 28 million whereas with our technique using the identical network elements would deliver the same performance but incur costs of maybe 4 million thats a factor of seven difference
6129741 going back to the question of 10gige there is no way you could interconnect 25 000 nodes using 10gb ethernet today there just isnt the equipment available for that we could do so at some cost even today but its not insurmountable for somebody who has significant communication and computation needs and the appropriate budget they could use our techniques to deliver 10gige all the way out to the edge servers

6129747 can books be better than television you bet they can when lee goldberg is writing them get aboard now for a thrill ride
6129748 top billing should go to michael connellys harry bosch story suicide run and to lee goldbergs jack webbs star the former for the detection and the latter for biggest laughs
6129749 as dark and twisted as anything hammett or chandler ever dreamed up leaving travis mcgee in the dust
6129750 its funny with some great monkisms and tightly plotted the characters are expanded beyond their tv confines and theres even a clever twist at the end how tv tie ins should be
6129751 goldberg makes adrian monk much more interesting than the tv version
6129752 goldbergs succinct writing style with an emphasis on witty dialogue laugh out loud hijinks and nonstop action will make a devoted monk fan of anyone who picks up this surprisingly entertaining read
6129753 ive never seen so much as a single scene from the television series so why do i enjoy lee goldbergs books about the character so much well lets see theyre funny theyre well written theyre carefully plotted and theyre poignant they probably have other good qualities too but those should do for starters
6129754 it will make you cackle like a sitcom laugh track

6129762 in order for it to assume an enhanced operational role in kosovo in the area of the rule of law under the overall authority of the united nations

6129795 we found that red tide toxins can be metabolized by other species of phytoplankton that holds true for both the brevetoxins that damage members of the animal kingdom and the as yet unknown allelopathic toxins that kill other competing species of algae
6129796 it could be that skeletonema is degrading karenias allelopathic chemicals just like it degrades brevetoxins or it could be that skeletonema is stressing karenia out making it harder to produce allelopathic chemicals
6129797 we found that when we took seawater and added purified brevetoxins to it the live algae didnt suffer much so there must be other chemicals released by the red tide that are toxic to these algae
6129798 what we do know is that this diatom s costatum is able to undermine these toxins produced by the red tide as well as the brevetoxins that are known to kill vertebrate animals like fish and dolphins
6129799 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
6129800 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
6129801 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
6129802 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
6129803 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
6129804 but what was really cool is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frog and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals

6129806 further studies into the cellular and molecular processes leading to these changes could have implications for understanding and treating brain infections brain tumors and neurodegenerative disorders
6129807 astrocyte polarization as opposed to hypertrophy may be due to the fact that t cells engage in a very focused attack and the astrocytes respond in a directed polarized manner we know that the astrocytes respond in this polarized manner but we are continuing to investigate precisely why
6129808 we believe this is part of a defensive astrocyte response that may serve to destroy the attacking t cells
6129809 when a t cell recognizes an astrocyte infected with a virus or identified as a foreign cell it launches an attack in response the astrocyte polarizes toward the t cell and may actually end up engulfing the aggressor if so this could be a novel unique mechanism of defense by brain cells against immune cells

6129814 the significance of our study is that it identifies smurf1 as the signaling partner through which tnf does damage in ra related bone loss
6129815 that has enabled researchers to begin designing small molecule drugs to shut down the action of smurf 1 and its relatives furthermore since mice engineered to have less smurf1 expression develop thicker bones future drugs that shut down smurf1 may be also useful against more common forms of osteoporosis simply by changing the dose of course this is early stage work with many obstacles ahead but it is exciting nonetheless
6129816 our over all hypothesis is that in inflammatory diseases like ra the function of a group of enzymes like smurf1 gets turned on to cause proteasome degradation of key regulator proteins leading to bone loss
6129817 the real future solution will involve a treatment that specifically addresses each of these

6129828 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6129829 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
6129830 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
6129831 this would appear to be true even if the obesity results from binge eating as this disorder is characterized by eating patterns that are similar to drug taking patterns in those with cocaine dependency

6129836 several initiatives have been undertaken to ensure growth that includes growing our core businesses via capacity expansion and overseas markets improve efficiency and acquire new businesses related to our activities
6129837 we want to increase the market for our products both domestic and globally and to do that we have to ensure that our products and processes conform with the halal requirements
6129838 the polyketal microparticles we developed are simply a vehicle to get the drugs inside the body to the diseased area as quickly as possible
6129839 the major advantage to using these polyketals to deliver drugs is that they degrade into biocompatible compounds that dont accumulate in a patients tissue or cause additional inflammation
6129840 we think these microparticles are going to be fantastic for oral drug delivery because they can survive the stomach conditions before they release their contents in the intestines
6129841 patients with acute liver failure need drugs as soon as possible or else theyll die
6129842 weve tailored the polyketals hydrolysis rates to deliver the drug in one or two days
6129843 delivering proteins inside microparticles has been limited because getting the protein into the microparticles required organic solvents that frequently destroyed the proteins
6129844 to overcome this problem we developed a method of simply immobilizing the protein on the surface of the microparticles
6129845 in the past few years we have developed methods to tailor the polyketals properties which have already allowed us to target many different medical conditions but our end goal is to test these treatments in humans
6129846 the reason why we have done all the preparation is to do it list it before the end of the year of course at the end of the day it is all dependent on the market
6129847 so far about 65 per cent of its total net lettable space of 355 323 sq ft has been taken up mainly by foreign companies we expect it to be fully tenanted by end of this year
6129848 the malaysian real estate market is undergoing a stage of rapid growth following the countrys healthy economic performance over the past few years
6129849 the 30 per cent quota imposed currently is not helping consumers since developers are merely transferring the cost in building other properties to them
6129850 but by being made to subsidise less we can then transfer the cost savings to our buyers
6129851 factors such as price increase of building materials and the current local political environment are impacting negatively on the industry
6129852 this move will encourage house purchase and property investment among the general public
6129853 by taking on the role of main contractor for future phases of the project we are looking at savings of between six per cent and 10 per cent in margins
6129854 prices of malaysian properties in the global market are still competitive and the government can help malaysian property players who market their projects overseas by giving tax incentives for overseas property promotion efforts

6129868 however post olympics we expect a revival of chinese activities as the suspension of industrial and construction activities in beijing is viewed as temporary
6129869 we decided to be proactive and come up with a no payment during construction scheme for home financing in anticipation of the impact of rising costs of living on disposable income
