1630001 mijn vrouw en ik maakten een wandeling in het hooggebergte toen een kudde schapen bewaakt door drie patous het wandelpad blokkeerde de herder was nergens te bespeuren
1630002 wij zijn dan voorzichtig door de kudde gegaan de honden keken maar deden niets zie je wel dat ze vriendelijk zijn zei ik nog tegen mijn vrouw toen we erdoor waren heb ik me omgedraaid om een foto te maken van de schapen
1630003 tegelijkertijd vielen de twee andere honden mij aan en wierpen ze mij op de grond

1630120 the arena clarifies the fundamental interpersonal goal of reflective leadership with the other panes defining key tasks to achieving it the arena is the place where our shared understanding of ourselves puts us in real and genuine contact with one another and therefore gives us the capacity to create a common vision for change reflective leaders are intentional around this goal and intensely conscious of the level at which they are connecting with others

1630132 an influence is not the same as a cause genes and hormones may predispose a person to one sexuality rather than another but thats all predisposition and determination are two different things there is a major problem with gay gene theory and with all theories that posit the biological programming of sexual orientation if heterosexuality and homosexuality are indeed genetically predetermined and therefore mutually exclusive and unchangeable how do we explain bisexuality or people who suddenly in mid life switch from heterosexuality to homosexuality or vice versa we cant the reality is that queer and straight desires are far more ambiguous blurred and overlapping than any theory of genetic causality can allow
1630133 the relative influence of biological versus social factors with regard to sexual orientation is still uncertain what is however certain is that if gayness was primarily explainable in genetic terms we would expect it to appear in the same proportions and in similar forms in all cultures and all epochs as the anthropologists clellan ford and frank beach demonstrated in patterns of sexual behaviour 1965 far from being cross culturally uniform and stable both the incidence and expressions of same sex desire vary vastly between different societies
1630134 the homophobes are thus paradoxically closer to the truth than many gay activists
1630135 for most of us it is impossible to subsequently change our sexual orientation
1630136 all of the hard stuff is done now its just time to have fun
1630137 im just letting my body recover its been getting beat up for 12 weeks so i finally get to rest now
1630138 im not going to get tired on you especially in a five round fight i plan to get stronger as the fight goes on im not really worried about five rounds im in great shape ive been sparring hard im pretty confident in my cardio right now
1630139 it always helps a little bit to have somebody with you whos fought somebody that youre going to fight just having somebody that is that good of an athlete that you get to train with every day is a bigger asset and the camp im at and how good the guys are in my gym and the trainers who coach me
1630140 as long as i kept doing the things i was doing training the way im training i wanted to keep improving and keep winning i knew id get my shot eventually i just had to pay some dues the higher level guys wouldnt fight me the ufc had to find the guys to fight me because a lot of people said no
1630141 i wasnt bashing georges st pierre thats just what happens he adjusted and i think hes worked through that i dont think its a problem for him any more it would be foolish of me to go into the fight thinking that hes only going to take me down at that time and place he was still questioning that knockout hes had two fights since then hes grown hes adapted hes learned to get through it
1630142 the biggest thing is not to let him get into a dominant position i cant think of too much of a game plan everyone makes mistakes nobodys perfect its just a matter of time for me to take advantage of his mistakes
1630143 im very comfortable on my back i spend a lot of the time training on my back i have a very good bottom game i just havent had to use it in a fight situation ive been able to get up and get away i fought really good jiu jitsu guys with great top games like carneiro im comfortable there wherever the fight goes im comfortable with
1630144 i think thats one of my strengths is being really good at those transitions
1630145 some of those guys are real good strikers or really good on the ground or really good wrestlers that level in between each of those is what some of them are missing out on they arent able to transition from the striking to the wrestling smoothly its either they are striking or they are wrestling its not a smooth transition georges is good at it too thats something i can use to my benefit in this fight

1630156 it is a thigh strain we need to wait but it could be one week
1630157 the other team were fitter than us but you could see we were passing pressing and the understanding between the players was better i am really pleased with the result
1630158 too many companies hold the view that business change is a move from one state to another that has to be controlled and managed in a consistent structured way
1630159 leaders need to invite input ideas and inspiration from all people within the company so they start to digest it own it and want to make it happen
1630160 therell be no one match or several matches ban for referees from now on
1630161 theyll be taken off from the list for every single serious mistake
1630162 theres a thousand things i do better than spending time with you
1630163 there can sometimes be too much jargon and too many initiatives
1630164 then its like having lots of jigsaw pieces but nobody has the picture from the top of the box
1630165 as long as the values arent totally different from what the organisation could ever be it must be a genuinely shared aspiration with authentic commitment to making it happen
1630166 you need to have companywide consultation to find common ground and make implicit values conscious
1630167 how can we talk about a customer related value if your front line employee is not involved
1630168 no company should be arrogant enough to push its values onto employees
1630169 look at your values and ask yourself is this real
1630170 customer service is a basic principle of a successful business not a value
1630171 if you espouse teamwork as a value but most people are shut in their offices behind closed doors this says something about how serious you really are about the value
1630172 communications departments are often under pressure just to produce something glitzy
1630173 but with values the key intervention is to change the behaviour of senior leaders
1630174 actions will say much more to employees about our values than our words ever can
1630175 if an employee is told they will be rewarded for living a value of being pioneering
1630176 a conversation needs to happen around how they can be pioneering in their day to day role and what the tangible specific results of this behaviour would be
1630177 you can use values to get 40 000 people rowing in the same direction and thats a pretty powerful tool
1630178 takes a long time and requires an internal communicator with tenacity and resilience
1630179 having strong values allows us to attract and retain great people and they also define how to be successful in our business
1630180 our first value is be natural and this also sums up our approach to values themselves with our values were not trying to create something that doesnt exist weve simply tried to codify whats at the heart of the business
1630181 ultimately values are about behaviour and if you want to influence behaviour you cant do it through one way communication you have to focus on conversations
1630182 if you let people talk about values in their own words through anecdotes and stories you add colour and bring values to life
1630183 dont force it remember your values define your culture and whilst you would hope they are compelling it helps if they reflect reality if they dont work on the culture dont just publish a new set of values
1630184 bringing values to life in an organisation takes investment effort and patience
1630185 but we recognised very early that real examples are the most lucrative way to communicate values linking values to examples of everyday success is a great way to lift them off the page
1630186 others see this persons success and how it is celebrated and rewarded
1630187 they link recognition and success with real achievable examples of living the values and we hope seek to emulate that behaviour
1630188 values are threaded through everything we do and are explicitly linked to employee success and happiness
1630189 a financial analyst once asked me if i was afraid of losing control of our organisation i told him ive never had control and i never wanted it if you create an environment where the people truly participate you dont need control they know what needs to be done and they do it
1630190 but the reality is that we dont live in a quaker society where everyone is hugely committed to the success of the common cause yes you can make definite improvements on employee involvement and one or two steps forward would be a huge leap for most but the idea that youre going to have every single employee all singing all dancing and feeling involved is just not reasonable
1630191 i have the opportunity to do what i do best every day
1630192 i think its feasible to aim to get every employee involved in some areas of the business that can have an impact on business performance
1630193 but you cant have a culture of involvement in everything you cant have a 50 000 person management team
1630194 ive never in my career heard of an organisation that was too involved
1630195 ive never heard a leader say what are we going to do our employees are just too involved and committed to the business and i cant control it its just anarchy
1630196 involvement is simply an underlying philosophy that aims to encourage ownership commitment belief and action throughout the business thats a recipe for easing managements burden not for mob rule
1630197 in terms of shaping the company strategy there have to be clear limits and specific focus around who gets involved on what but equally if youre involving everyone in what goes on the canteen menu it would be a waste of everybodys time so structure and limitations are essential
1630198 most people in the business like to think theyre strategic
1630199 but most also accept that the corporate strategy is decided by a few and delivered by the many strategy has to have meaning for everyone but be seeded by the top leadership
1630200 its the job of the leaders to sell what the business needs to achieve and why
1630201 absolutely because the only differentiator many of those businesses now have is how well they can deliver a better customer experience
1630202 involved staff are connected to the main purpose of the business and they actively attempt to give the customer experience the company is trying to create
1630203 the higher the level of involvement the better chance you have of keeping your most talented employees
1630204 and thats a double whammy because people who are top talent and also involved with the business give of themselves to the customer on a whole new level
1630205 they were taking a core part of their external identity and involving employees in it internally
1630206 every employee felt involved in helping sky reduce their carbon footprint because of that
1630207 and there are so many issues involved in changing your business culture that its no simple undertaking
1630208 first everyone has to want to do it and for a very good reason second everyone in management has to act concertedly in the same way and with full agreement third there must be commitment to the long term if as research suggests it takes at least six years to change the culture of a company
1630209 you will never unleash employee talent to anything like its potential so its not how you get past those barriers its how you cant afford not to knowing that you simply have to commit to developing long term and getting help from wherever you can to drive that desire through every layer of leadership
1630210 although they are better educated more techno savvy and quicker to adapt than those who have come before them
1630211 they refuse to blindly conform to traditional standards and time honored institutions
1630212 its time for a new generation x y way of thinking
1630213 its not about top down or bottom up its all about side to side communication and sharing ideas across the organisation now because thats what they expect the new social media is built on the very principles of involvement and collaboration and side to side is where you really get the brains in the room its what drives dynamism and innovation business is missing a trick if its not already harnessing it
1630214 the crucial thing for us is that it leads to action
1630215 for me thats the big stepping stone of an involved approach to business its not just dialogue it leads to real change and weve already got 1 000 advocates for this card and its not even been launched yet
1630216 were changing the structure of how we work with colleagues around the world at the same time as managing increasingly tough competition and maintaining our market position
1630217 one of the biggest lessons weve learned and are still learning is that there is so much to communicate around the change it has too often become just show and tell
1630218 because weve done that we thought wed made employees clear about where we are
1630219 but because weve not had dialogue with them its been ineffective
1630220 its separate to the team briefing process and less formal
1630221 but its just making sure that people throughout the organisation are able to have crucial discussions back and forth in small interactive groups about the nature of the changes
1630222 and were using those stories to actually put together the visa vision
1630223 so our vision is almost going to be a story that updates itself every quarter from the inside by getting our peoples own journeys we have some employees who have been here for donkeys years others whove been here only 6 months and we strongly believe that if we put all their stories together that really is who the company is and where its going the company itself is not the management team or our products and services its the personal experiences and visions of every one of us that is visa europe
1630224 what kind of future do you want as an employee here
1630225 we still started with the big organisational items what we want to achieve in the next 12 months what our priorities are and then helping employees think about their own personal roles in those
1630226 but we also took a major amount of time in the day to ask people whats important to you and what do you want out of your future at itv
1630227 if mentoring programmes or training is what you want great so now go off and work out how wed achieve that and bring back to me as the manager of the department some proposals with costs attached and feasibilities for any challenging areas such as how you will backfill positions if you go off on secondments
1630228 it is so loaded with benefits that it amazes me that more businesses and managers dont apply it
1630229 they were a bit sceptical and they just wanted to see if anything would actually come of it
1630230 heres what you said you wanted to do heres what you guys have achieved we didnt do it for you you did it yourselves now what do we want to do next so its not just a once a year involvement event its a continuous programme of empowering people to fulfil their own destinies so we hope that next year well push that involvement level up another 10 and keep growing and at the very least if they dont get involved theyll know that they could do and something will happen as a result
1630231 the quality of the work they pitched to us really surprised us i suddenly realised just how very talented the people in my group are and mostly theyre quite pragmatic as well that was another thing that stunned me they didnt come up with outrageous completely undoable ideas they were all very realistic about the organisations capabilities and they built in optional workarounds thinking about ways to keep costs low
1630232 its brilliant its basically the things that you as a manager would be doing but instead youre passing it down into the organisation to the people who feel most passionately about it and want to work on it and saying give it some thought you take the time and development pressure off yourself and you give the people who want it most the chance to bring it to fruition
1630233 blessed be this day and this place and your spirit that has spoken

1630243 padahal katanya di usia tiga puluhan seorang wanita sedang hot hot nya dalam berhubungan intim saat ini saya tidak bisa mengimbangi hasrat istri saya itu
1630244 saya juga tidak mengerti mengapa kok sekarang saya seperti itu apakah karena usia yang sudah semakin tua gejala gejala yang saya rasakan persis dengan kondisi istri pertama saya ketika memasuki masa menopause apakah memang pria juga mengalami masa seperti itu

1630246 dan memang akan lebih rentan bila kondisi psikologis juga sedang buruk
1630247 penderita akan bertanya tanya kenapa kok fisik saya berubah apakah saya mulai penyakitan jantung ginjal atau gejala gejala penyakit lain karena tidak dicarikan solusi sesuai dengan sumber sakitnya akhirnya berdampak pada tekanan psikologis
1630248 kadang kadang gejala gejala itu menjadi ciri khas selama kurun 5 10 tahun sebagai masa berlangsungnya andropause atau masa gonjang ganjing hal ini akan menjengkelkan bila tidak dikenali sebagai gejala andropause jadi akan berdampak pada psikologis

1630256 studies have shown that microbes can survive the shock levels of being launched into space
1630257 and as more and more organisms are discovered under extreme conditions its become more plausible that things could survive in space for the time it takes to go from one planet to another
1630258 one hundred years ago people wondered if animals could go from one land mass to another
1630259 everything that is going on on earth occurred because the meteorites happened to land here but they are obviously landing in other places
1630260 if there is another planet that has the water and all of the things that are needed for life you should be able to get the same process rolling
1630261 the universe is mostly empty space but here and there are special places where complex things can happen clouds of dust planetary surfaces comets and asteroids

1630296 its just a great honor to receive all these dif ferent awards
1630297 since the trials it just opened up a new stage of media attention as well as supporters im more nationally known now its just a bit of an honor that people are taking notice
1630298 now that im a senior this year i cant say i want to do my best
1630299 i definitely want to win again and come out on top because it would really make a good end to my senior year
1630300 i have a lot more confidence now in all of my running just kind of running in the olympic trials thats kind of like a confidence booster in itself
1630301 at this moment the tibetans inside tibet are brutally and violently being crushed by chinese authorities
1630302 its absolutely critical that a message is sent to the chinese government to meaningfully address and end violence and repression in tibet or they will never be truly accepted by the international community
1630303 my face was pushed into the ground my arm was twisted and i was hit two or three times in the face
1630304 this is utterly unacceptable any time its particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics at a time when china has promised complete media freedom
1630305 acts of genocide continue to be committed against the tibetan people

1630307 ill probably get detained by the police and then ejected out of the country but i believe its not anywhere near the risk or the fear that tibetans are living under the occupation of the chinese government

1630311 theres no doubt in my mind that what senator obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
1630312 were not going to run a campaign like he did in the primary every time somebody brings up a challenge to who you are and what you believe youre a racist thats not going to happen in this campaign
1630313 has never said that he believes that john mccain is a racist
1630314 bumpy road to mayors office candidates for mayor need a road map on transportation
1630315 is to have big chunks of time during the day when all youre doing is thinking
1630316 were all on the same journey you can choose to do it with joy
1630317 well be back with more civil discussion after these messages
1630318 obama is bipartisan so long as that means asking republicans to take incremental steps toward his own broader goals
1630319 when it comes to compromising with the other side however obama says take a hike
1630320 the real obama fundamentally he is a big government redistributionist
1630321 what they portray is a barack obama sharply at variance with the image of the post racial post ideological bipartisan culture war shunning politician familiar from current media coverage and purveyed by the obama campaign
1630322 from the time they get up in the morning and flush the toilet theyre taxed
1630323 they get into their car theyre taxed they go to the gas station theyre taxed they go for lunch theyre taxed this goes on all day long tax tax tax tax tax even when they go to bed you can go to bed in fear that you are going to be taxed while youre sleeping that there is a sleeping tax
1630324 it is a sign that we do not use chemical products
1630325 we started with 150 farmers in 1999 and we are now dealing with about 50 000 farmers in apac and lira districts
1630326 the scheme offers cotton producers a minimum price and families no longer have to get into debt to buy expensive fertilisers and pesticides
1630327 in addition to a minimum price the companies also offer an extra incentive to producers cooperatives a fair trade prize
1630328 since i started growing organic cotton i get enough money to cater for my needs and to send my children to school
1630329 the launch of the project in northern uganda has led to a rise in the number of women involved in cotton growing from 1 to 40
1630330 nile perch exports to the international markets which were at 36 000 tonnes worth 143m sh239b in 2005 dropped to 33 000 tonnes worth 137m sh229b in 2006 suggesting a decline in catches
1630331 the department of fisheries resources has put in place a monitoring system to guarantee quality and safety of fish
1630332 this is when an idea struck me to set up a vocational organic agricultural centre and a demonstration farm on a two acre piece of land
1630333 using proceeds from the sale of 25 litres of milk i used to get everyday from my cow my salary and a contribution from my husband i embarked on building the centre in 2001
1630334 it was tough i had to look after my five children and relatives complete our residential house which was at the foundation level and the centre
1630335 work on the centre has cost about sh100m i even got a loan to finish it
1630336 after training the farmers are expected to be more innovative when they go back to their communities
1630337 our aim is to provide alternative job opportunities for the farmers so that they can engage in sustainable agricultural practices
1630338 bee keeping is a viable business environmental alert opened our eyes we were degrading the environment through making bricks and charcoal burning
1630339 this place is idle and flat the investors want the land mapped before it is leased out to them
1630340 we believe this project will be instrumental in bringing uganda and kisoro into the limelight it will also create many opportunities for the residents
1630341 its a shame we need to imprison the culprits who will serve as examples to others how long shall we keep on explaining to people that coffee is food and should be dried on tarpaulins
1630342 we had come to masaka to open coffee factories we closed last month because of handling coffee poorly we thought that they had adopted our recommendations however nothing has changed

1630351 these rice seeds alone are not enough naads must use some of its money to buy more seeds for the people who need them since they have expressed a strong desire to get involved in agriculture
1630352 the farmers who have taken the confrontational stance against government have not done so through the cfu and are not even members of the union
1630353 the cfu would rather engage government in dialogue so that we all come to a solution to our challenges we do not want to reverse the land reform programme but our members would participate in the exercise
1630354 we need to put our differences aside and work as a nation we are zimbabweans and we need to plan for our future as one through dialogue
1630355 at least 500 cfu members have applied to government for consideration in the redistribution exercise and are still waiting to be given offer letters from the relevant authorities
1630356 they cfu members are eager to participate in the programme as zimbabweans
1630357 many of our members are referred to as white settler farmers when in fact they are indigenous white zimbabwean commercial farmers we are proud to be zimbabweans and wish to play a proactive role in the affairs of our country
1630358 there is enough land for all in zimbabwe there is however need for people to respect the diversity of our cultures and work together as a nation to find solutions through dialogue
1630359 naads will provide assistance to farmers through groups individual farmers will not be considered the government is targeting organised groups
1630360 we now have fine matooke flour that can be substituted for wheat flour raw tooke flour can be used for baking bread cakes biscuits and cookies

1630398 the issue of screening for prostate cancer is frankly an area of medicine that remains somewhat unsettled
1630399 while its clear there is benefit to a significant number of men its equally clear that many men end up being diagnosed and treated for cancers that would likely not have caused them any significant harm
1630400 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease

1630414 there is some additional flexibility afforded to students in terms of their outreach and how they design outreach
1630415 we call the schools and get the demographics of how many african americans go to that school then we put together thousands of packets with fliers like an introduction to the university financial aid how to write essays
1630416 we go to the classes that have never heard of berkeley before
1630417 they are passionate about what theyre doing because they care
1630418 the students have seen the need for greater diversity and have taken it upon themselves to assist and supplement the universitys effort
1630419 the simpsons should have come on our show i had an idea around the seventh or eighth year and thought we should try a roger rabbit style episode where they crossed real folk and animation we could do homer comes to the fbi and deals with cartoon characters i still feel its a good idea

1630453 whenever i spoke it was howard hughes speaking we had an incredible relationship
1630454 im not asking you why they didnt exercise birth control i want his brilliant talent by my bedside the rest of my life
1630455 but howard hughes wanted to be bob maheu he was very envious of bob in many ways he liked manly men in hollywood hughes was a great admirer of robert mitchum and everything he embodied in the world of politics and intrigue robert maheu was that figure that hughes just couldnt be he was a great presence a real wheeler dealer
1630456 the plan was always subject to a go signal which never came
1630457 if you want a place to sleep buy a hotel
1630458 if he wanted someone fired i did the firing if he wanted something negotiated i did the bargaining if he had to be somewhere i appeared in his place i was his eyes his ears and his mouthpiece
1630459 he finally told me that he did not want me to see him because of the way in which he had allowed himself to deteriorate the way in which he was living
1630460 and that he felt that if i ever in fact saw him i would never be able to represent him
1630461 is not grabbing howard hughes with my two hands shaking him by the shoulders and saying enough is enough
1630462 no one was more blessed than i to have lou teicher as my best friend since we met at the juilliard school of music at the ages of 9 and 6
1630463 although we were two individuals at the twin pianos our brains worked as one
1630464 lou was certainly one of the worlds most gifted pianists
1630465 that became their gimmick to become noticed and that got them on television in new york
1630466 ernie kovacs steve allen and dave garroway picked them up immediately because it was avant garde it was weird
1630467 they told their producer co arranger don costa two pianos itll never sell
1630468 the huge dynamic theatrical sound that they created is what people just swooned over
1630469 they just loved it and thats what sold the records it was a new sound nothing had ever been created quite like it the twin pianos with their 60 piece orchestra
1630470 the apartment and exodus set what would become the ferrante amp teicher sound
1630471 as pianists its ironic how we both ended up living on keys
1630472 lord i apologize for that right there and please be with the starvin pygmies down there in new guinea a men
1630473 my primary purpose was to say thank you for the work that youve done to provide additional encouragement and support
1630474 i respect them i appreciate them i want them to be safe in doing their jobs i want them to be respected by the public
1630475 just because a couple people did some really bad things some horrible things some outrageous things the rest of our dhs workers should not be painted with a negative brush
1630476 maybe the language was a little vivid but as a parent and as a city worker and as a worker at dhs i feel the same way
1630477 you want to see the passion from the person in charge under no circumstances should someone die on your watch
1630478 he needs to see us as the professionals we are he needs to see that were risk takers we risk our lives every day we go places where police wont go

1630480 every time a mayor comes in and theres a scandal they say they will fix things
1630481 this will facilitate the capacity of young people from each country to work and holiday in each others countries he said
1630482 im a very firm believer that schemes like this broaden the understanding of each others cultures
1630483 usually when people are taking a holiday to australia they are only given a tourist visa and cannot work he told reporters
1630484 with this agreement our children who are taking a holiday in australia are able to work in all lines of working fields according to the needs there
1630485 there has been no decision by the australian government to have a guest worker scheme with anyone as yet he said
1630486 while you know there is consideration before cabinet about such matters the focus is very much on the south pacific as a trial
1630487 a decision will be taken and announced shortly about that but the focus has always been on both the south pacific and a trial as part of our attempts to stabilise the south pacific economies
1630488 there has not been any formal engagement with indonesia on those issues senator evans said

1630497 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1630498 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1630499 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1630500 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1630501 ive never really understood in all my years why has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1630502 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1630503 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1630504 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1630505 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1630506 i have no idea why ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear

1630511 i have left every other thing and both my son and me are devoting every minute to complete the three statues
1630512 i always felt that that memorials should be built during the lifetime of icons that is why i got the first statue of my mentor kanshi ram installed in lucknow during his lifetime but because he wished that i should also have my own statue next to his i decided to go ahead
1630513 it is my recommendation that the city council and the city not take any steps to place the offered initiative on the ballot for the next general election
1630514 in my opinion this is not a valid initiative petition and it may not be submitted to the voters in its present format at the november election
1630515 our position is that just because the council hasnt implemented the state law doesnt mean were not entitled to the initiative process
1630516 we acted in good faith the city has all the power in the world to put this on the ballot
1630517 while we cannot absolutely rule out the possibility that at some point in the future some court might conclude that the constitution automatically grants initiative power to enact ordinances to voters in all washington cities we note that we have not located a single case reaching that holding indeed we have not even located a case where the issue was raised
1630518 its a first for me to hear about something like this
1630519 its confusing in a way because of the state powers that exist but thats a different mechanism
1630520 he went in had a brief conversation and shot the clerk
1630521 based on the video it did not appear to be an argument
1630522 i came here with their philosophy to start this theater
1630523 and summerplay is one staple from the original theater that i wanted to carry on
1630524 theres not a lot of venues that do what we do at the changing scene premiering new and independent works anyways but theres even fewer festivals available for one acts
1630525 the thing about summerplay is that its a great festival for the summertime its just so nice to have little snippets of something you dont have to concentrate on for too long
1630526 were just doing everything we can to try and fundraise and get creative in this horrible awful time for us
1630527 i make rings where your finger will be broken first
1630528 a piece of jewelry is personal and it tells a story it should be durable enough to last for years
1630529 that was trust and a handshake to do it to do it right and to get it done in a timely manner

1630531 theres a deadly new fruit drink on the markey that could kill your kids which one find out at eleven
1630532 will your holiday weekend be a day in the sun or will it be a washout compared to that of a ten thousand ton glacier cliff collapsing into the water find out at eleven whooo hoooo
1630533 theres another hurricane brewing in the atlantic will it be as bad as katrina glue your eyeballs to the tv screen and find out at eleven
1630534 well as you can see the wind in here is strong enough to stretch my nutsack 3 yards behind me but im gonna tell them to crank er up so that my eyeballs will be blown through the back of my skull and i can get first hand experience of a force fuckin 5 hurricane
1630535 oh well predicting the weather isnt an exact science bob

1630538 the response i am getting from my people here tells me that they dont know anything about naads and have not benefited from the programme at all naads co ordinator come and explain to these people how much money you got how the programme has progressed and how many people have benefited
1630539 he is a thief arrest him go with him and let him bring the money
1630540 i think it was a very good exercise bearing in mind where we are in terms of pre season
1630541 everyone is starting to sharpen up i was very pleased with the way we played and we understood the role to play against a very clever team tactically
1630542 the only negative is that we havent got everyone ready for saturday
1630543 we need to be very alert and ready for whats going to be a big challenge because this season every single game is going to count
1630544 for them to keep us in the dark and just have us answering a bunch of questions that we cant possibly have a good answer for i dont think its fair to us
1630545 i think there needs to be something said yea or nay for brett favre
1630546 its to the point now man were tired of it here in the locker room just hearing about it
1630547 hopefully they get something done upstairs and they can answer these questions instead of the questions coming to us
1630548 we have an excellent opportunity here to be a very good football team in 2008
1630549 weve had an extraordinary challenge dealing with this situation a lot can be learned from it but they definitely want this thing resolved as soon as possible
1630550 when its in your face like this how do you avoid it how do you not allow it to be in the back of your head you cant
1630551 youre thinking about it everybodys in here thinking about it and we just dont know what the next moves going to be
1630552 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
1630553 he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1630554 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1630555 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1630556 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1630557 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1630558 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1630559 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1630560 these are not naughty postcards from the beach they are undoubtedly porn pure and simple some of it is quite dark
1630561 cauterise the lower lakes has infuriated some groups who want the federal government to save the lakes instead by buying more water from upstream irrigators
1630562 there is not enough water in the system to bring down the sorts of quantities of water youd need to fill the lower lakes and to handle the evaporation in the lakes and transmission loss senator wong told abc radio
1630563 even if we did make a decision to not give any allocations upstream there is insufficient water currently in storage less the critical human needs issue for us to viably manage the lower lakes with the amount of water that we have
1630564 do we want to build a weir no mr rann said
1630565 penny wong has waved the white flag on the future of the lower lakes he said
1630566 destroying the freshwater ecology of the lower lakes for a generation a half century or perhaps even a century
1630567 if that action is taken it is a very sad day for how australia has mismanaged the murray darling basin he said
1630568 its a profoundly important decision because the advice i have is once the salt waters in there it is next to impossible to get it out
1630569 thats part of a mature responsible relationship with the chinese government
1630570 we will always raise our human right concerns with them
1630571 ive done it in the past ive done it privately ive done it publicly ill be doing it at again
1630572 i think its true to say that in the sweep of time over the last quarter of a century the last 30 years china has made substantial improvements
1630573 not just in human rights but in other areas such as trying to spread the economic benefits but it is the case regrettably that we do continue to have very significant concerns
1630574 i think it is important to make this point the olympic games the olympic spirit is an unambiguously good thing for china
1630575 and one of the reasons we were very strong on both raising our concerns about tibet but at the same time saying we didnt see a boycott of the olympics as being in any way useful was because china hosting the olympics is a very good thing for china
1630576 weve seen the prime minister speak out in support of tibet when he visited china earlier in the year and weve seen the impact that has had within the chinese leadership
1630577 it appeared she didnt even look backwards and turned 90 degrees across the highway
1630578 the idea is for them to really come here and see how they can grow their professional repertoires
1630579 teachers need to be able to experience it before they can help children experience it
1630580 little kids little boys especially really like it because its beating things with sticks
1630581 as a society i think that all of us are spinning too many plates
1630582 conversations like this remind me that we need fewer plates and better spinning
1630583 we looked at washington state history through the eyes of islanders
1630584 thats the community part that makes this feel so good
1630585 were asking how can these farms be centers of learning not just working landscapes
1630586 since theyre only three hours away they decided theyd come spend a month with us
1630587 this is a warning for altaf hussain to cease his statements against the taliban and end his kingdom in karachi otherwise we will launch attacks against the mqm and its leaders once we are given the go ahead by baitullah mehsud
1630588 so i came back with a little bit of trepidation about entering the united states medical system not having any income anymore
1630589 we would like to believe that he is still with us and would appreciate the fact that we are helping his loved ones
1630590 in fact when we mention kristis plight several folks have said they would like to contribute in honor of her father
1630591 im used to being really active and doing yoga and pilates and dance and things like that
1630592 gone over the top in helping me in a number of ways
1630593 please let me get through this so that i can help other people
1630594 the optimism i have really comes a lot from people who believe im going to get better

1630597 find someone to love amp be loved by because i wont be here forever amp i want to see you happy before i go
1630598 i love my country but i needed to train at this moment
1630599 i remember four years ago we came with a big mission
1630600 this time weve got huge expectations again to take medals back home so its very important for me
1630601 its a great honor to be carrying the flag on friday its great to be part of the olympic family so i will be very proud the olympics is very different to any other tournament we play
1630602 we have four major grand slams in a year for other athletes here it is almost do or die we will give it all we have got but in two weeks time there is the u s open
1630603 the medal was the biggest highlight of my career and i feel a bit of a veteran here we play as individuals most of the year and so it is a huge highlight to be in a team and feel that team spirit
1630604 features aya and saki sisters with a passion for obliterating zombies and an equal enthusiasm for showing off their assets as they battle hordes of enemies in their skimpiest outfits
1630605 if they keep the look of it it would better that it is now
1630606 here in the u s 74 percent of adults have heard of computer power management but 46 percent either wrongly identified it or didnt know what it is
1630607 a really easy to use free tool for the consumer
1630608 and once you set it you can forget about it
1630609 the building sector creates more carbon dioxide than the total emissions of japan france and the united kingdom added together
1630610 what were concerned about is technically getting done what we need to do to become a better football team
1630611 to have the focus the intensity the mental energy to give the kind of effort and stay focused on mentally doing what you need to do to do your job
1630612 all that theyve learned they need to continue to show they can play with high energy give a lot of effort play with toughness
1630613 theyre going to make mental errors and we expect that at this point but they are the guys that can play football the way wed like for them to play it
1630614 b j and julio both make plays play fast are in good shape and are both tough guys
1630615 i think thats very helpful it shows some maturity out there in what theyre doing
1630616 it may be a little simpler maybe to play receiver than it would linebacker
1630617 i think a lot of the drills we do are geared toward the development of receivers defensive backs throwing them the ball effectively and efficiently
1630618 those guys are showing nice progress and have shown ability to make plays
1630619 hopefully theyll continue to learn so they can help us
1630620 we went over to visit coach stallings to pay our respects to the family and john mark
1630621 the one thing id like to say about the stallings family i dont know how anyone could do a better job of raising someone with a more positive spirit that impacted so many
1630622 we just wanted to help and support any way we could
1630623 hes probably going to be out for a day or two
1630624 hes excited about learning and were excited about teaching him
1630625 to make a true artisan pizza you need high quality dough
1630626 dough making is a lost art lots of pizza makers dont understand that there is a true science behind it
1630627 i enjoy the idea that i am making a meal for a family to consume one that is so fun to eat one that puts smiles on peoples faces
1630628 i guess ive always been attracted to seeing someone flip a pizza in the air to stretch the dough
1630629 for the three years out there i didnt step out on the beach it was crazy i was probably working 90 to 100 hours a week
1630630 to some people it is just pizza but to us it is the world

1630655 having advanced its diplomatic steps the bush administration is in a stronger position now to argue that iran hasnt felt enough pressure and so the right response is to focus their minds with another round
1630656 the us should not pursue another round of sanctions unless its sure of getting it
1630657 theyd better not go to the well unless they are sure they will be able to bring up some water
1630658 the pressure on iran to comply with the demands of the international community and its obligations the international sanctions will only grow
1630659 with all of this coming up in the fall iran will be injected into the presidential race no matter what the iaea finds or how the sanctions debate proceeds
1630660 was mir auff llt ist dass die schiedsrichter recht kleinlich pfeifen bei situationen die zwar hart aussehen wo aber nichts passiert pfeifen sie einfach ab
1630661 in england ist es so attraktiv f r die fans weil viel mehr in den strafr umen passiert die deutschen schiris sind da bervorsichtig wir spieler sind doch aber daf r da die leute zu unterhalten
1630662 solche vorw rfe kennen wir doch seit jahren und au erdem wie will jens lehmann das berhaupt beurteilen er war doch die letzten jahre gar nicht in deutschland
1630663 je mehr ich an das endspiel denke desto w tender werde ich das mindeste was man sagen kann ist der schiedsrichter war parteiisch
1630664 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1630665 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1630666 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1630667 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1630668 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1630669 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1630670 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1630671 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1630672 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1630673 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1630674 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation
1630675 i have no idea why john mccain doesnt support it it hurts him in indiana and missouri and ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear
1630676 past research in fibromyalgia syndrome had found a number of symptoms that are prevalent including pain reduced ability to perform everyday tasks sleep problems and depression
1630677 it has not been clear up to now whether one of these symptoms caused the others because they are all identified at the same time and they are all related
1630678 there are many practitioners who believe that it may be depression that causes fibromyalgia symptoms which impacts how patients are treated in clinics our study shows that in fact depression is at the end of a cascade of symptoms that begin with sleep problems
1630679 our findings indicate that this population may benefit greatly from treatments both medical and behavioral geared toward improving sleep
1630680 in too many virginia governors races to count ive shaken hands with candidates who dont look me in the eye they think we dont notice we are just cogs to them well get a nod about an issue and know well never get real consideration much less any agreement but here is a man who listens tim kaine treated us as the caring people we are his sincerity shows

1630698 enterprises are moving into the cloud and understand its financial value but they need software that lets them deploy and manage applications that meet complex requirements creating this software and doing it right requires a lot of work from many talented people i am happy to rely on the backing of such outstanding investors and market pioneers as elastra delivers the product functionality and robustness our customers demand
1630699 we pride ourselves on yugmas radical ease of use and reliability for users on any platform so its very satisfying to have an independent evaluation confirm our attributes versus such strong competitors

1630702 what would you include in a national energy policy especially with respect to natural gas issues
1630703 kellihers inappropriate relationship and communications with corporate lobbyists not only tainted the administrations national energy policy but raise questions about the ability of mr kelliher to be an impartial voice at ferc
1630704 ferc is weathering a storm of criticism for its deficient handling of the west coast energy crisis the commissions failure to maintain any effective enforcement of dozens of corrupt energy corporations the deteriorating relations between ferc and nearly half of the state utility regulators who continue to be mistrustful of the commissions jurisdictional intentions and the commissions poor track record protecting consumers
1630705 a multi pollutant regulatory strategy should be estimated for the power generation sector including gradually phased in mercury nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emissions reductions reform replacement of nsr use of market based emission trading programs inclusion of both existing and new plants and equal treatment for both
1630706 not all will be done but perhaps some of these ideas could be floated and adopted
1630707 streamline requirements under the clean air act for electric generating facilities while at the same time making major reductions in air emissions
1630708 direct the administrator of the environmental protection agency epa to propose multi pollutant legislation that would establish a flexible market based program to significantly reduce and cap emissions provide regulatory certainty to allow utilities to make modifications to their plants without fear of new litigation provide market based incentives such as emissions trading credits to help achieve the required reductions
1630709 a person of interest is not an official designation it is abused law enforcement is politics those in power use the term to assure the public that theyre doing something police authorities fear admitting that they literally have no clue who committed a crime
1630710 unfortunately these politicians trash lives along the way the person of interest is someone against whom there is no real evidence but someone who can be at least for a time used vilified scapegoated its time our law enforcement politicians learn to say no comment and for them to educate the public that very often especially at the beginning of a case police have no idea who the perpetrator was or at least no real evidence the public should want responsible action and restraint not simply action the media should also cease its complicity in this charade and rigorously question politicians who finger someone as a person of interest asking what evidence the police have to support their grave allegation otherwise naming someone a person of interest cheaply serves many of the same cynical purposes that show trials serve in totalitarian regimes
1630711 the person of interest phenomenon is something like the opposite side of the coin from terrorist watch lists in the name of improving public safety government authorities want to create some status for suspicious seeming individuals that would enlarge governments investigative power without triggering the civil liberties protections that go with identifying anyone as an actual criminal suspect so far it is not at all clear how much safety the public is getting out of the shift to a preventive law enforcement mentality there is a substantial risk that we will wind up less free but actually no safer

1630713 the chinese government has been informed that the president will not be able to attend the opening ceremony of the olympics in beijing
1630714 the cancellation of the china visit by president musharraf is an important development
1630715 given our special relationship and friendly ties with china it is unimaginable that a pakistani leader would cancel his visit and that too for a very important occasion for our ally
1630716 general musharraf is a commando and he might make a commando attack on the parliament just like he did on november 3
1630717 all 10 people on board were killed and their bodies are already recovered
1630718 at approximately 2 30pm the issue occurred again so you can surmise from that it was related to software
1630719 the basic version of kpc k4500 k4800 comes with everyday applications ready loaded for convenience and the added benefits of extra security and stability thanks to its foresight linux operating system for those who prefer windows vista is now available on the premium version of kpc
1630720 the idea of microsoft free personal computing has been in the air for a while
1630721 were just partnering with linux distribution vendors and hardware vendors to make it happen
1630722 our role is more on evangelizing and providing the necessary software for corporate needs
1630723 i think the need for alternatives to the microsoft dominated personal computing environment are there
1630724 were viewing this as an alternative to the microsoft small business server group of products
1630725 rather than talk about virtualization technology for an appliance were talking about something that is simple and has a small footprint
1630726 a lot of it shops lack the experience to quickly deploy a linux based cluster
1630727 by making this software stack available were trying to make cluster deployment faster
1630728 one of the new features is that it allows you to build custom servers
1630729 so users will only have the components that are necessary for running their particular application and this adds tremendously to the agility and flexibility of the system
1630730 there are also additional server monitoring tools included and overall deployment and system management has been streamlined

1630733 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
1630734 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
1630735 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death

1630742 anyway there are all the same and with the leader on top it will not make any difference
1630743 highly entertaining website its been awhile since ive actually laughed at something on the internet i am for sure looking forward to more the links are super organized and easy to navigate very nice job
1630744 this blog shows how to laugh when we forgot the importance of it your blog conveys a lot of message for our life thank good luck
1630745 quando pela primeira vez contemplam juntos a noite de lua cheia
1630746 o amor faz me recuperar incessantemente o poder da provoca o
1630747 the event had more of the feel of a rally than the usual midsummer fundraiser
1630748 part of the sorensen institutes mission is to promote civility in politics bloggers play an important role in educating the voters
1630749 we hope that by bringing bloggers of all political stripes together that we can promote a civil discourse of the important issues facing the commonwealth
1630750 it is becoming increasingly evident that bloggers will be playing a significant role in the political process over the next few years
1630751 for some time it has been my desire to see virginia bloggers step to the forefront in promoting an atmosphere where bloggers can help move virginia forward on issues important to us all rather than engaging in partisan bickering im very pleased that the sorensen institute is taking on this project and i look forward to attending
1630752 blogs have become a promising medium for involving more ordinary virginians in the political process
1630753 weve only seen the tip of the iceberg in terms of how blogs can be used to inform include and empower voters in virginia
1630754 this conference comes at an ideal time in the growth of the virginia political blogosphere
1630755 it will allow bloggers on all parts of the ideological spectrum to come together and discuss blogging as a medium before we head into the fall elections in virginia
1630756 if you look at the bill carefully youll see that these get out of jail free passes are not being offered to all criminals
1630757 this bill says that if a child molester simply proposes sex with a neighbors child thats a crime and it should be 1 10 years but if that same criminal actually rapes or sodomizes his own niece or his student or a player on his ballteam thats a social problem and its okay to punish it with a fine
1630758 albo took the weakest law protecting kids indecent liberties and used it as a trash can to dump every rotten thing you can do to a kid into if he wants to use the crime commission to do this kind of thing he should pick on someone his own size and leave child crime victims alone
1630759 using that logic were waiting to see if mr albo is going to introduce a class 6 felony homicide law or a misdemeanor drug dealing law next
1630760 oh i wanna van i can go down the coast in and camp and go surf in
1630761 the best times weve had was down around lorne when wed park on the edge of a cliff overlooking the ocean and make a big beautiful bed in the back with clean pillows sheets and play scrabble and cook dinner and go camping those moments made it all worthwhile because thats exactly what wed pictured from the first moment we saw the kombi at little narrabeen
1630762 yeah yeah itll get through rego and it goes great
1630763 oh my god this car is a piece of shit
1630764 look we can rebuild her but itll probably take six months and cost a shitload more money
1630765 nup we cant do it black what about orange and white or sky blue
1630766 mate if ya paint it black its gonna look fucken shithouse youre gonna ruin it
1630767 mate if ya paint it black its gonna look fucken shithouse youre gonna ruin it
1630768 the writer may very well serve a movement of history as its mouthpiece but she cannot of course create it were glad to welcome camille to diet soap and look forward to how shell influence the future of this little journal
1630769 if i were asked to answer the following question what is slavery and i should answer in one word it is murder my meaning would be understood at once no extended argument would be required to show that the power to take from a man his thought his will his personality is a power of life and death and that to enslave a man is to kill him why then to this other question what is property may i not likewise answer it is robbery without the certainty of being misunderstood the second proposition being no other than a transformation of the first
1630770 a consistent libertarian must oppose private ownership of the means of production and the wage slavery which is a component of this system as incompatible with the principle that labor must be freely undertaken and under the control of the producer
1630771 on the us lenovo site you can pull up the w500 model 4058cto and the r400 model 7443cto for 0

1630773 visa is issued to an alien an investigation is invited to china
1630774 the primary focus of the joint venture is to define and develop extensions to the fmg glacial valley magnetite deposit part of the abydos project
1630775 fmg may earn a 60 per cent joint venture interest in the iron ore rights by delineating inferred resources of iron ore within the tenement
1630776 this is a ground breaking third party port access agreement the first of its kind in western australia
1630777 we now look forward to building on our association with fmg as we commence development of our second iron ore project 120km south of port hedland at abydos
1630778 every other day we receive an offer with a base case that we would achieve a premium to the benchmark price
1630779 in the latest version of the islamic penal codes bill which has undergone several modifications such punishments are not mentioned
1630780 the implementation of stoning has been suspended for several people who have received this sentence
1630781 two of them have been pardoned by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei and then sentenced to about 10 years in jail
1630782 and the verdict for two others has been changed to lashes
1630783 we have attempted to show all known claims agreed boundaries and one thing that has not appeared on any other maps which is the number of areas that could be claimed by canada denmark and the us
1630784 we are talking 90 million barrels of oil nearly 17 hundred trillion cubic feet
1630785 i suppose for any state control over hydrocarbons is significant as other resources dwindle
1630786 the other factor is the melting of the polar ice and that is making it easier to explore the area which is why the oil and gas industry is looking at it
1630787 it is now becoming a potential area of development rather than a hypothetical one
1630788 it is vulnerable and extracting oil and gas is not an environmentally friendly activity
1630789 many of the victims were not immediately given first aid treatment because of the inaccessibility of the place
1630790 we found out that the victims were afflicted with cholera
1630791 our offer is clear and their response is not clear
1630792 the iranian government needs to respond in a very clear way to the generous offer from the international community
1630793 as predicted it basically says yes we will give you an answer but when you give us an answer
1630794 there is not enough water in the system to bring down the sorts of quantities of water youd need to fill the lower lakes and to handle the evaporation in the lakes and transmission loss
1630795 even if we did make a decision to not give any allocations upstream there is insufficient water currently in storage less the critical human needs issue for us to viably manage the lower lakes with the amount of water that we have
1630796 penny wong has waved the white flag on the future of the lower lakes
1630797 destroying the freshwater ecology of the lower lakes for a generation a half century or perhaps even a century
1630798 if that action is taken it is a very sad day for how australia has mismanaged the murray darling basin
1630799 its a profoundly important decision because the advice i have is once the salt waters in there it is next to impossible to get it out
1630800 consumer md jeff henry and his team are delivering great progress
1630801 were building content businesses we can monetise we remain confident on the 150 million
1630802 our online strategy is based on what we think is going to be a very big new market with the delivery of longform streamed video the numbers coming out of iplayer and itv com in terms of speed at which consumers of broadband have embraced longform video suggest that this is going to be a very big new market opportunity for advertisers and us we intend to be there in a major way
1630803 the growth of the internet as an advertising medium is taking business way from direct marketing classified and local and regional press but doesnt appear to be taking away from television what matters is that we outgrow the growth in internet advertising in the first half of this year the internet grew as an advertising medium by 24 percent and we grew at 43 percent so were growing at nearly double the rate
1630804 we recently in one period sold out all video ads we appear to be able to maintain our rate on video sales jeff and his team have done a stunning job on itv com were looking to create more inventory on itv com and hold are rates
1630805 i think we made it a little harder on ourselves by not moving the ball around as much
1630806 we didnt make our outside shots tonight as well as weve been in the past but at the end of the day we won the ballgame we found a way to win
1630807 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ballgame
1630808 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1630809 is bound to go down as one of the greatest mountaineering tales in k2s history
1630810 they had to descend without any safety lines and in that descent we know that some climbers have slipped down and their whereabouts are unknown
1630811 moving river of ice broke loose like an iceberg breaking loose from a glacier
1630812 not only did it wipe away the fixed ropes but it brought the whole slope into icy dangerous conditions
1630813 coming down at dawn in the dark with little oxygen is very very dangerous
1630814 she is not my mummy she is a stranger she took me from my mummy they took me from my holiday
1630815 it is harrowing to hear a child saying that if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on
1630816 we need to know what happened with this this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police if that hasnt been done that is exactly the kind of information that the private investigators are going to follow up
1630817 he concluded that the man was monitoring the movements near that path and into the apartment the man looked suspicious he was watching the apartment
1630818 kate was not aware of these e fits nor is she aware of what happened to the dutch sighting they were never told anything about it or whether any of these sightings were followed up properly that is the most frustrating thing

1630832 this takes you through the handbook of what not to do
1630833 we support our employees who we believe took appropriate actions at the time of the incident

1630835 oh my should i do it this way oh my what if they have javascript turned off oh boo hoo what if they rip off my images wah wah wah
1630836 this sixth generation of golf cars will completely redefine the quality and comfort level of its class over broad categories offering more customer value than ever before
1630837 it is more accentuated than its predecessor with precisely defined lines and edges and with finely proportioned flared surfaces and recesses
1630838 a new level of quality is established in the golf vi with the adoption of materials and equipment usually associated with a vehicle in a higher segment
1630839 the result is new levels of acoustic damping to make the new golf the quietest yet
1630840 there is no public transport the mining industry is closing down
1630841 we have a limited attendance at our four mines in south africa
1630842 i do support the message not the strike they shouldnt have stopped the transport
1630843 these strikes will probably do more damage than good because all we do is send a message that were a strike prone country and its not good for the image of south africa
1630844 it is a thigh strain we need to wait but it could be one week
1630845 the other team were fitter than us but you could see we were passing pressing and the understanding between the players was better i am really pleased with the result
1630846 its like the practice in chinese tradition of having all parts of the world come to pay tribute
1630847 also lets your own people know that the rest of the world confers legitimacy on and supports the government
1630848 knowing that the chinese would take stock of those decisions very few statesmen could avoid showing up
1630849 the chinese leadership has signaled that coming earns points for the countries concerned
1630850 the impairment charge is due to the downturn in the short term outlook for the advertising market which is an area highly exposed to the general downturn in the economy
1630851 we cannot control the economic environment in which we operate
1630852 as a result of the recent slowdown in the television advertising market the board has taken some tough decisions which are reported here today
1630853 they will be ready at first light tomorrow with police ses and the army

1630855 i dont have the same marketable image as a ronaldo or a lionel messi
1630856 such a good salesman that any company that gets you is going to use you as a salesman
1630857 experience is what you get when you didnt get what you wanted
1630858 we cannot change the cards we are dealt just how we play the hand
1630859 the brick walls are not there to keep us out
1630860 if youre going to do anything that pioneering you will get those arrows in the back and you just have to put up with it i mean everything that could go wrong did go wrong but at the end of the day a whole lot of people had a whole lot of fun when youve had something for ten years that you hold so precious its the toughest thing in the world to hand it over and the only advice i can give you is find somebody better than you to hand it to
1630861 although this pushes back the previous target by two years we expect to meet our revised online target without relying on substantial acquisitions
1630862 failure to deliver new online propositions on a business to consumer model was also identified by itv as a risk
1630863 2008 is proving a tougher first year for the five year turnaround strategy than anyone could have predicted a year ago
1630864 now is not the time to burden the residents of los angeles county with yet another tax increase taxpayers in our county already pay the second highest tax rate in california behind only alameda county
1630865 chris williams microsofts director of product development explained his attitude to software piracy in the far east were just flooding the market with copies the goal is that when people actually end up having to buy software they will already know our software and its the one they will have to buy when the laws get passed were basically getting market share as soon as we start to get a return on that investment it will be humongous
1630866 but microsoft and our co sponsors intel and hewlett packard went further and have agreed that our patents essential to implementing c and cli will be available on a
1630867 id like to explain why ive never felt emphasis mine the two are in conflict
1630868 but lets not waste our time on this discussion on the mailing list forlegal matters you should get legal counsel have your lawyers engage microsoft on this topic that is the only way of getting a solid answer
1630869 will be offering a conventional non royalty non fee rand license
1630870 this is where i say i will license a royalty free license to my essential patents and in return i expect you to license your essential patents to me on an royalty free basis
1630871 the gpl incompatibility presumably isnt a big problem for mono since i think its under an x style license and gpld apps can still run atop it

1631102 well i saw a mans hand trying to break through the back door but we had it locked good we called the police but they said theres nothing they can do

1631142 it is very much deserving of this wilderness designation and protection
1631143 i am also particularly proud of the broad support from local stakeholders for the proposed wilderness designation without their action and advice the work to protect browns canyon would still be in its infancy i look forward to working with my colleagues and passing this much needed protection for browns canyon

1631150 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1631151 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1631152 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1631153 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1631154 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1631155 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1631156 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1631157 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1631158 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1631159 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1631160 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation
1631161 i have no idea why john mccain doesnt support it it hurts him in indiana and missouri and ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear
1631162 to lower trade barriers decrease trade distorting subsidies and stabilize an affordable food supply for all nations
1631163 reasonable reforms to our crop insurance program and our system of countercyclical and direct aid payments
1631164 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio worker makes in a year
1631165 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1631166 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1631167 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach
1631168 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1631169 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1631170 t boone pickens is about as conservative a guy as there is thats a serious republican oil man driller he says we cant drill our way out of the problem i think he knows more about it than john mccain
1631171 strongly encouraged by sen obamas speech on americas energy future foreign oil is killing our economy and putting our nation at risk
1631172 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1631173 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties

1631175 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1631176 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1631177 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1631178 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1631179 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1631180 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1631181 security was tight and was a bit over controlling which is par for the course at these events and as par for the course i tried to get near the candidate when i saw another reporter there alex leary security tried to throw me out but i found a mccain staffer i knew and the person vouched for me
1631182 race played absolutely no role in any actions taken by our employees or anybody else in this case
1631183 i definitely wish i was never singled out i came up there to do a story thats all i wanted to do is write a story
1631184 its the right thing for the mccain campaign to do
1631185 our issue remains with the secret service agent his actions are still a problem the senators campaign has done the right thing and we appreciate that
1631186 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1631187 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1631188 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1631189 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1631190 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1631191 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1631192 by and large these are not run to identify spies they are run to thwart what the officer is trying to do to us and to learn more about what they are trying to do to us

1631196 one of the real areas of satisfaction if you can call it that is that weve maintained all along this was an inside job
1631197 i hope somebody who has some authority will call us and make it right with this family
1631198 it seems to me they botched this thing from the beginning it was one of their own people
1631199 the united states denies as a matter of law and fact that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief sought
1631200 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again hes the original maverick one is ready to lead mccain
1631201 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened a lot of jobs have been created
1631202 reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again
1631203 if there is a significant increase a major nuclear renaissance with a large number of new plants a second repository may be needed
1631204 but you have to say compared to what the cost of doing nothing is a lot higher
1631205 all youre doing is pushing the whole problem out into the future and significantly increasing the cost

1631239 my fellow country men what should we do at this point
1631240 its not as good as wed like it to be but i want to remind you a few months ago there were predictions that the economy would shrink this quarter
1631241 the report is unlikely to sway the federal reserves interest rate decision next week in either direction since output growth in 2008 is likely to remain in line with the fed s central tendency of one per cent to 1 6 per cent
1631242 nature is calling and we have been invited back to the forest to become teachers for a whole new generation of spokecritters
1631243 it was time for a change the beavers have served us well they were very well known and quite popular but its time to move on
1631244 overall this result is a clear disappointment especially since almost all preliminary indications for the month pointed to modest growth
1631245 the widespread nature of the weakness underlines the fact the economy is swimming upstream
1631246 assuming no growth in real gdp in june would leave second quarter annualized quarter over quarter growth at 0 4 per cent bang on our base case forecast issued in mid june
1631247 without a turnaround in labour markets and job creation there is the risk that 2008 could finish like 2007 with growth turning mildly negative
1631248 in the face of this risk we expect the federal reserve to continue to hold fed funds at its current stimulative level of 2 per cent into the middle of next year to try and foster some strengthening in labour markets
1631249 u s businesses are likely to continue economizing on their use of labour services which will likely result in further job losses down the road
1631250 we dont have a heavy regulatory burden on the cellular industry
1631251 thats something that we have tried to maintain in canada at the end of the day consumers do need to be protected ive made these points publicly and privately with mr cope as well
1631252 beyond regulation we can have the discussion that weve had and i think its a respectful dialogue that we have with the cellular industry
1631253 i think theyre cognizant of comments that ministers make and theyre aware that the telecommunications industry is regulated largely by the minister of industry
1631254 im not hinting at regulation im simply saying that this needs to be addressed the cellular phone companies need to address the issue
1631255 this is a serious issue that canadian consumers want to see some action on regulation is an alternative that other countries have explored
1631256 i think we have been taking an approach that is responsive to canadians responsive to the concerns that weve heard
1631257 weve not taken any heavy handed steps to use your term we simply indicated we were concerned about the charges that were being proposed we thought they were at variance with what consumers expected
1631258 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee

1631296 i started calling all these people and everybody was talking to me like i was crazy
1631297 so what gives me tears is if barack obama wins kids are going to say that a black man can be president too
1631298 i think it will give so many people black latin asian even white people that feel forgotten hope i did not think i would see it in my lifetime and im only 34
1631299 with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning without michelle he wouldnt be there
1631300 oh i want her to not take herself too seriously

1631303 track and field is my career you can make money at it but its like with anything it depends on how good you are and how well youre liked
1631304 media can make or break you if you have a great personality the crowds buy into you and that will make you a more in demand person i can be at the top of my game but have a bad attitude and a bad personality and nobody wants to come see shawn
1631305 in any field whether youre a doctor or whatever you just have to be a people person
1631306 in all sports you have to be at the top of your game when you step out to compete you want to be competing at the best of your ability with track and field our bodies have to be tuned to precision it takes a while to get tuned to precision you just cant be running all the time and expect to compete at your full potential
1631307 youve got to be at home practicing making sure your running is precise getting treatment all that stuff when you step out on the field as a track and field athlete your body is like an indy car or a top field dragster you want it to be clicking on all eight cylinders every time
1631308 when we go out there weve got to be ready to tune in
1631309 a slight sprain there ache here those little things will put you in the back of the pack
1631310 its not just taking your natural ability to run and going out and competing with that you take your natural ability and strengthen all the weaknesses in your natural ability and make it precise
1631311 every movement has to be efficient and account for something you dont want to waste any energy everything is tuned in towards the goal of winning and being a champion that goal is to have a medal that goal is to break records that goal is to be the best
1631312 i seem to take things more seriously than before on and off the track every decision affects my career
1631313 i enjoy what i do i enjoy being driven to try to be the best

1631416 actually nicolas did call a little later that same night
1631417 your mother invited me to lunch is it all right if i come back sometime

1631566 toda la evidencia cient fica apunta a establecer que el mejor intervalo de tiempo entre dos embarazos es de dos a os con un m ximo de cinco y este ciclo m ximo est dise ado para que una madre joven no vuelva a comportarse como primeriza y para evitar malformaciones o patolog as cong nitas en las mayores de 35 a os
1631567 cuanto menor es el tiempo intergen sico entre gestaci n y gestaci n mayor ser el riesgo de que el beb por nacer sufra restricci n de crecimiento intrauterino antes esta situaci n se llamaba retardo de crecimiento y hoy se denomina bajo peso al nacer para evitar confusiones con el retardo mental que es otra cosa
1631568 en per odo de lactancia sus reservas est n destinadas al hijo que amamanta y tiene menos probabilidades de ofrecerle los alimentos que necesita el feto en gestaci n
1631569 es muy importante tener en cuenta este detalle antes de realizar la planificaci n familiar porque al respetar los lapsos ideales entre un parto y otro disminuye el riesgo de morbimortalidad fetoneonatal e infantil y aumenta la expectativa de vida del reci n nacido
1631570 se enfermare hasta el punto de no poder continuar su actuaci n en el juicio
1631571 me refiere un dolor de pecho en regi n precordial de car cter opresivo debido a los antecedentes que tiene el general de portar una fibrilaci n auricular cr nica ser hipertenso y las caracter sticas del dolor que aparentemente es un angor angina de pecho recomiendo la internaci n del paciente por entre 12 y 24 horas para hacer estudios y descartar que sea un sindrome coronario agudo
1631572 cuatro a os atr s no me imagin ver el estadio de esta manera esto demuestra que en el club no s lo se trabaja en lo deportivo sino que tambi n lo hacen a nivel institucional
1631573 school authorities did not bother to inform police even after the tragedy but locals contacted us after hearing the screams of the students
1631574 curlin couldnt win the haskell we could curlin got beat by a filly we havent our horse is undefeated on grass curlin isnt i dont know why people think curlin is such a good horse were way better than curlin
1631575 i think its bad for racing to have trash talk
1631576 to run down another guys horse i dont think its right it demeans the industry id like to meet big brown preferably on the dirt which is each ones best surface but i think theyre considering retiring big brown before we have a chance to meet him
1631577 it depends on whether big brown wants to evade us or wants to meet us
1631578 i find it interesting that jackson doesnt like trash talk because what he said sounds like trash talk to me im not upset at all about what rick said i dont think its wrong to say my horse is better than your horse i think building a rivalry between horses is good for the game as long as its not personal i would love to have the opportunity to run against curlin
1631579 this is the most polarised situation i have seen in a generation i think before the situation is tackled tempers have to cool down
1631580 one needs to step back from the brink and handle this very carefully its sitting literally on a tinderbox
1631581 it is terrible and the animosities run so deep what is more frightening is that the integrity of the state has come into question the entire situation has been so badly handled for such selfish gains
1631582 cutting off the lifeline to the state by blocking the srinagar jammu highway for several days now is extremely serious
1631583 the fact that the jammu administration had to black out two local television news channels and seal the offices of two hindi dailies for allegedly whipping up communal passions shows the serious fallout of this stir
1631584 i have never seen a situation like this in a very long time but who is responsible
1631585 the authorities have imposed a false curfew on jammu this communal lot from himachal pradesh and punjab who are siding with the protesters have to be isolated and i will ensure that those in the valley do not play into their hands
1631586 this allegation is obviously wrong it could weaken the cbis case
1631587 another important fact which needs to be brought to the attention of the supreme court is that despite its order dated march 5 2008 staying all further proceedings in the ghazipur court the judge in gross violation of its order has proceeded to hear the bail applications of the accused
1631588 a free and fair trial cannot be conducted in ghazipur court
1631589 it would be open for the applicants accused to approach the ghazipur trial court for bail and if the bail application is moved the trial court shall decide it on merit
1631590 a wrong allegation against a sitting judge made deliberately with mala fide intention will not only weaken its case but also jeopardise the credibility of governments top law officer vahanvati who is a person of impeccable credentials
1631591 we will be directly recruiting about 60 per cent of field staff mainly at the level of police sub inspectors for intelligence gathering through state recruitment board
1631592 the direct recruitment for intelligence operations means these staff will be deputed for intelligence gathering only they cannot be transfered for policing duty

1631602 and when the old bloody minded tyrant is gone to his long account paraguay will be torn by revolutions violent in proportion to the previous unnatural calm that country will have to learn like every other south american state that a republic cannot succeed till it contains a certain body of men imbued with the principals of justice and honour
1631603 the second day after our return to the anchorage a party of officers and myself went to ransack an old indian grave which i had found on the summit of a neighbouring hill
1631604 the natural history of these islands is eminently curious and well deserves attention most of the organic productions are aboriginal creations found nowhere else there is even a difference between the inhabitants of the different islands yet all show a marked relationship with those of america though separated from that continent by an open space of ocean between 500 and 600 miles in width the archipelago is a little world within itself or rather a satellite attached to america whence it has derived a few stray colonists and has received the general character of its indigenous productions considering the small size of the islands we feel the more astonished at the number of their aboriginal beings and at their confined range seeing every height crowned with its crater and the boundaries of most of the lava streams still distinct we are led to believe t hat within a period geologically recent the unbroken ocean was here spread out hence both in space and time we seem to be brought somewhat near to that great fact that mystery of mysteries the first appearance of new beings on this earth
1631605 its a danger to human life a danger to marine life and to future life
1631606 yorkshire water urgently need to put the matter right to prevent further pollution for this and future generations
1631607 each serious industry has its own conference but not chefs in canada we need to come together and get a food culture evolved
1631608 im yearning to know whats going on in newfoundland or nunavut or in the whole country really
1631609 the chefs ive spoken with all want to get involved they all want to cook
1631610 the boss of the big restaurant he knew my restaurant
1631611 the foods really good and thats why the customer they sometimes they saw the boss susur lee
1631612 i choose this place because i love the food its very fresh
1631613 a vietnamese restaurant reportedly frequented by susur lee perhaps torontos hottest chef an excellent bowl of pho cost 5 25 about the price of a spoonful of guava sorbet at one of mr lees places
1631614 the customers that come here come here they wouldnt change the flavour of their food
1631615 any food you try you know that this one better
1631616 i dont want to show off in front of the window
1631617 ossington used to be not a very busy place not a welcoming place to other people and tourists
1631618 therefore we got new customers a lot more new customers into our restaurant
1631619 its a very good location many people come this way
1631620 i think eventually it will become so gentrified it will be like queen west
1631621 when that happens all the big companies or people who have deep pockets will take over then it wont be so interesting any more
1631622 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time
1631623 and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1631624 it will be power to the people again as it comes to reducing property taxes as much as 25 percent

1631634 it is harrowing to hear a child saying that if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on
1631635 we need to know what happened with this this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police if that hasnt been done that is exactly the kind of information that the private investigators are going to follow up
1631636 he concluded that the man was monitoring the movements near that path and into the apartment the man looked suspicious he was watching the apartment
1631637 kate was not aware of these e fits nor is she aware of what happened to the dutch sighting they were never told anything about it or whether any of these sightings were followed up properly that is the most frustrating thing

1631656 we are subject to a dirty tricks campaign which is about to set a new low level for gutter politics in new zealand
1631657 its our opinion its the labour party activists and i think weve got enough evidence to prove they were trying pretty hard to get in there for lots of different reasons why else would tapes like this appear you dont have to be sherlock holmes to work out whos got the motivation behind this
1631658 if youre eavesdropping on somebody elses conversation that youre not part of then you might be breaking the law if its clear that those people intend it to be private
1631659 i was persuaded to determine that an issue of privilege was involved because of the high public interest and because of the implications of the reputation of members and the institutions of parliament
1631660 i trust that the privileges committee will examine the rules and make recommendations that will ensure the house is not bought into disrepute
1631661 i want to tell the member dressed as a cockatoo every day in this house that the evidence given by malcolm wright as eventually published by the new zealand herald when they finally get their mind around it said three things number one i wasnt there when the matter was raised number two i was annoyed and angry when it was raised and number three i wasnt there when any money was paid over

1631670 we are delighted to have both alan and mark on board with ireland
1631671 both of them are extremely strong technical coaches in their areas and i think they will bring a further positive mix to the coaching team and squad
1631672 alan brings with him experience of both international and most importantly irish rugby
1631673 mark is recognised as one of the top kicking coaches in the world and his experience of working with the squad in the past will help with the transition over the next number of weeks
1631674 the parameters of how it is going to work are pretty clear and ive been involved in the process all the time
1631675 its not going to interfere with alans role at leinster and if anything it might provide some continuity in that some of the players hell be working with will be involved with both leinster and ireland
1631676 hes been doing a lot of handling work with the forwards as well hes been a head coach so its offered a good deal of flexibility
1631677 we can adopt different roles and sometimes it allows me to sit back and watch its been really good so far
1631678 the times hes going to be with ireland are generally going to be down times with leinster anyway
1631679 its a positive for leinster its a positive for ireland and its a positive for alan
1631680 everyones on the same page theres been consultancy the whole way along the line
1631681 riff is a senior coach too so its good to have that expertise in both camps it will challenge him too and hes been a great influence since hes been here
1631682 its precautionary were blessed to be able to give them another week of recovery but both could have played if we needed them
1631683 we will see what happens on the field in terms of when we can use them off the bench but we know theyre ready
1631684 morgan is doing well after his surgery last night to reconnect nerves and repair damage in his left arm and hand the surgery last night lasted four and a half hours hes visiting with family this morning as of this morning hes up and walking around and looking forward to his release in a few days
1631685 its not possible always to do everything like other programmes you have to start somewhere and there has to be a cut off point so the decision has been made not to proceed with the catch up for cost reasons
1631686 clearly if were going to do this in primary schools wed be doing it in sixth class if we were to have a catch up programme wed have to do it in second level schools

1631691 everything was smashed the youngest one is missing her teddy which would be like a comfort blanket for her
1631692 it breaks my heart and we have started a fund to help the children
1631693 with reference to the brutal murder of jean quigley in derry jean as a member of project children came and stayed at our home for several summers
1631694 she was a delightful beautiful child and everyone loved her she filled our summers with joy as a young adult jean came to visit us just last summer and the glorious child we knew had matured and developed into a gorgeous kind thoughtful young woman
1631695 she had a delightful sense of humour and a smile that would melt a glacier
1631696 we know we are close to bangladesh as a team we dont fear them and it will be great to test ourselves against them again and against india the world champions both games will be fantastic

1631703 as i opened the curtains james came through the door and i said your hero is here craig
1631704 im sure that was the moment he went he heard my voice and knew james and his family and best friend tommy hill were there
1631705 someone mentioned to james if he had heard what had happened to jonesy and he put his mic down and rushed from the gig straight to the hospital
1631706 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1631707 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1631708 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes

1631729 tenemos la sensaci n de que permiten que los violentos jaleen y los radicales tomen la calle
1631730 nuestra apuesta es hablar con todos y convencer a los nacionalistas
1631731 la opini n del pp vasco coincide con la de todo el pp creemos que no es un debate que est abierto
1631732 gobernando el pp la pena m xima se extendi hasta los cuarenta a os antes estaba en los treinta
1631733 a nosotros nos repugna que terroristas como de juana puedan estar en la calle como cualquier ciudadano normal por eso pedimos una revisi n de la reducci n de las condenas
1631734 no creemos que sea oportuno abrir el debate entorno a la cadena perpetua es inconstitucional
1631735 la posici n del pp siempre ha sido muy firme no se ha quedado nunca en las palabras
1631736 los tibetanos y sus seguidores en todo el mundo condenan el intento del gobierno chino de usar los juegos de 2008 para cubrir su ocupaci n del t bet y su actual campa a de represi n sobre los tibetanos que luchan por sus derechos b sicos y libertades
1631737 en los juegos ol mpicos aunque no porque pau gasol vaya a verse obligado a disputar muchos minutos sino porque ahora
1631738 pero el seleccionador espa ol como los jugadores y el resto del cuerpo t cnico mantiene la mente ocupada exclusivamente con el primer partido ol mpico ante el equipo griego
1631739 grecia viene de jugar el preol mpico donde ha marcado un gran nivel y es un partido diferente a todos los dem s en segundo lugar es un rival dificil simo como se demostr en la final del campeonato del mundo que es el partido que mejor ha jugado espa a ellos eliminaron en la semifinal a estados unidos y el a o pasado en el europeo estuvieron a punto de impedirnos el pase a la final adem s vienen con ritmo de competici n
1631740 el primer partido es muy importante porque marca un poco la l nea y grecia ha arrasado en el preol mpico adem s sus pivots tiran desde fuera y eso es una dificultad a adida para la defensa
1631741 dependemos de nosotros pero todos los equipos dependen de si mismos porque estamos a cero
1631742 i see the cellphone as the modern day trojan horse
1631743 in the beginning of the grecian era the trojan horse while appearing to be a gift in reality carried soldiers that invaded the city the cellphone is todays trojan horse it appears to be a wonderful gift while inside lurks a dangerous enemy invisible harmful electromagnetic radiation
1631744 there is research that shows bluetooth devices may be as harmful as the cellphone itself you now have a microwave transmitter living in your ear right next to your brain while the power level may be lower from the bluetooth it is constantly transmitting its like sticking your head into the microwave oven but hoping its ok because you are setting the power level low
1631745 and i like to think of myself as specializing in health care as distinct from sick care and well being as distinct from treating the patient and the symptoms to simply making the pain go away my experience is while the medical world may be early adaptors of leading edge diagnostic systems they are often late adaptors of preventive concepts and systems such as the delta shield i have protected my family with this device and i strongly urge my patients and friends to use it
1631746 the ironic cover has been passing from fashion as openness and omnivorism have become the cooler cultural model part of my own turnaround on late 90s teenpop came from hearing richard thompson doing an acoustic cover of
1631747 tim needed to be non manipulable he needed a hope of transcendence he needed sometimes to be immune to the princesss caring touch
1631748 our world with its rules of causality has trained us to be miserly with forgiveness by forgiving too readily we can be badly hurt but if weve learned from a mistake and become better for it shouldnt we be rewarded for the learning rather than be punished for the mistake
1631749 2000 points 25 00 id have to spend twenty five fuck dollars on this shit thats like half the cost of siren blood curse and that was an actual video game and it was actually really good
1631750 maybe the other side aint so bad after all in small doses
1631751 i feel very excited and very proud because the olympic games is a 100 year dream of chinas
1631752 we did this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool
1631753 the conditions are not unfavourable at the moment and my understanding is that we are not going to be taking any extra measures
1631754 leon is of course a pro at handling these kinds of situations so he cooperates with claire to handle the situation there will be a lot of mysteries and incidents they have to take care of
1631755 angela so youve got claire and angela its up to leon to take the pick
1631756 i have been meeting chinese leaders for 7 1 2 years and my message has been the same you should not fear religious people in your society
1631757 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place
1631758 ought to welcome people being able to express their minds and to the extent that people arent able to do that and people arent able to worship freely it is a mistake
1631759 but its also an opportunity to say to the chinese people we respect your traditions we respect your history
1631760 im concerned about north koreas human rights record im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation and its ballistic missile programmes
1631761 the best way to appoach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1631762 they have got to show a verification regime that we can trust
1631763 you can verifiably do what you say youre going to do or you continue to be the most sanctioned regime in the world
1631764 more clearly demonstrates the contrast between free and open societies and repressive closed societies than the korean peninsula

1631769 its taken him a while but hes started to throw better and more consistently
1631770 i think hes feeling better health wise he seems to be bouncing back better but again right now our starters are doing a pretty good job and were pretty pleased with how guys have done overall we dont have any plans to bring him to the big leagues as of now well continue to monitor his progress
1631771 yeah were definitely concerned about that we dont want him to lose his edge and stuff like that or his conditioning because hes not getting the work
1631772 hes here because we feel like right now we need him
1631773 and hes good enough to be here we feel like he may help us who are we going to replace him with
1631774 if we had our druthers wed have him stretched out and pitching every fifth day
1631775 but right now we feel like wed rather have him pitching in the big leagues than not
1631776 we invited all the outfielders who played a certain number of games he definitely was invited
1631777 we would love for him to come he was definitely a big part of this organization
1631778 let me say this ive never been more nervous on the field in my life
1631779 growing up in texas you see those kinds of storms all the time
1631780 i would say i dont think it will be long term because i see how different i feel now from the day it started getting worse
1631781 i feel much better now so i dont think it will be too long i hope
1631782 im just going to get after it and go as hard as i can for as long as i can
1631783 i feel like i need to be turning that water into wine
1631784 im going to have to be very careful cautious with handling this bullpen situation
1631785 i dont want to discourage anyone but at the same time i want people to step up
1631786 for criminal elements that kind of thing is a treasure the criminals know that palestinian elements pay a lot of money for laptop computers belonging to army and security people this story ended well but nevertheless it was a bother for the defense ministry the soldier who reported that deserves praise
1631787 each time it was someone else and all the time they asked for details about the car at one point with a bit of humor they asked where do you work what do you do
1631788 that tuesday when i went to work i saw some people and a photographer gathered around the car i got annoyed got into the car and left
1631789 i didnt notice the cd next to the drivers seat
1631790 someone suddenly said to me this is haim from the defense ministry you have a cd in your car with jericho 4 nuclear upgrade written on it i want to meet with you and see the cd i thought he was laughing at me and then he said i will come with a police officer well meet at the police station on jabotinsky street
1631791 suddenly haim appeared out of nowhere with someone else both of them dressed like security guards blue shirts army uniform trousers and earphones
1631792 and they showed badges and asked questions i realized that they had been to the apartments where we had lived before because they mentioned them
1631793 one of them sat in the car put the cd in and went through it song by song
1631794 there were mizrahi songs songs in spanish and songs in english in the end they confiscated the cd took down mine and my mothers information and telephone numbers and disappeared
1631795 they could have just called me i would have left work and given them the cd i was already starting to think that something was really going on they said that they would contact me and give the cd back i really like that cd and want it back
1631796 a work of art with no hidden function at all

1631798 typically we dont see as many at this time of year
1631799 we have one in the u s that is in huge demand and weve been told how many we are getting others from canada didnt expect the demand and are taking time to catch up everybody is ramping up production
1631800 its a substantial decrease compared to the cost of oil or electricity
1631801 we are shipping the same volume to the same customers and it seems to be meeting the need
1631802 every time oil spikes theres a spike in firewood demand
1631803 were trying to keep up to the market but anything ordered now wont be delivered until september
1631804 our commitment to the molson brand in the u s is if anything even stronger now because we realize that we havent got it right
1631805 the fundamentals of the business remain very very strong our brands are performing well were getting pricing were getting volume and we need to manage the input inflation and im sure well do that
1631806 partly a sentiment index if things are not getting as bad at a slower rate it can feel like improvement
1631807 qualitatively it changes nothing about our assessment of the economy growth is at best weak and inflation pressures remain elevated
1631808 it was really a perfect storm that catapulted oil to its record of us 147 and now bit by bit youre seeing that really subside
1631809 bottom line the trend is moving down and probably will continue to do so slowly but surely for the next six months
1631810 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1631811 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1631812 the economy may already be in recession yet the monetary policy committee feels unable to act given that inflation is well above target and rising
1631813 isaia is currently at full back for auckland and has played there previously at the international and the super 14 level
1631814 hes also got the ability to play elsewhere in the backline which is helpful when we are a long way from home
1631815 leon is improving but the medical advice is to take things slowly
1631816 hell gradually get back into exercise and then training and then may look to play an air new zealand cup match for canterbury
1631817 she was one of 16 children and was predeceased by all but her surviving siblings
1631818 we cant lose the majority of these games when we play the marlins and the mets
1631819 weve got to win some of these games weve got to play a little bit better than 500 in these games
1631820 i really dont know if i gave them a chance to do that
1631821 i think my command was so poor tonight that really didnt matter
1631822 i think that its definitely new to him and it would take him a while to really get used to the bullpen
1631823 but i tell you since they got johnson and sanchez back that definitely makes their rotation solid theyre a good team
1631824 the way i look at it i beat myself tonight
1631825 you feel awfully sorry for the little boy his parents and probably what hes going to have to deal with for a good bit
1631826 they said he seems to be ok the first thing you see is your children its unfortunate but we had to continue to play
1631827 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1631828 i hope we dont miss him for very long but you think of a guy of jobas caliber and you know hes going to miss a start that doesnt mean the guy who replaces him cant pitch well

1631831 this investment is about job growth at home and its also more
1631832 companies like origin are helping bring the nova scotia brand to businesses and consumers around the world
1631833 origins product line and go to market strategy has been validated through strong market demand
1631834 we look forward to being a partner as origin continues its impressive growth
1631835 weve already got people working on the next investment you have to work ahead
1631836 we probably had about 200 people here a lot more kids too for some reason but that just made it even more fun
1631837 when we moved to tacoma we first lived in the hilltop
1631838 we know how they went through their improvements cleaned up the neighborhood that was done by the residents being present never flashy rarely quotable all gray did in seattle was win
1631839 on november 4 well find out what people want their community to be
1631840 the only thing thats changed about our all volunteer grass roots group is that weve grown and weve learned how to do things better
1631841 everyone knows its free food this draws everyone but once were here we celebrate as a neighborhood
1631842 weve seen a lot but its better a lot better and its because of the neighbors
1631843 challenges in the real estate market clearly touch every aspect of our portfolio
1631844 the real estate business is still tough tough tough and indications going forward are for more of the same
1631845 theyre in human resources law finance it corporate affairs building support services and just about everywhere else
1631846 as we move out of them well gradually consolidate into this building
1631847 none of this has been a surprise to anyone in federal way
1631848 the number maybe it shouldnt be a secret that theyre going through a process its a transition theyre not just walking people out the door like starbucks did
1631849 obviously its going to have some short term impacts with the retail and service sectors
1631850 you take that many people out of employment and those are going to have effects its an additional strain on small business
1631851 a thousand is a big number but its not like were a one company town its not the sort of boeing effect from 1972 were not going to turn out the lights
1631852 we as a city will continue to support weyerhaeuser any way we can and continue to work with them
1631853 whenever you make an announcement that large you have a lot of uncertainty
1631854 for a little while everybody is going to be taking a gulp of air and wondering how its going to shake out
1631855 theres been that pent up rumor that something was going to happen and now that people know what it is people can deal with it
1631856 this is wonderful its exciting to see them move this big a piece of equipment
1631857 theyre not only going to have to set the stator in place but theyre going to have to do a lot of moving it around
1631858 its very difficult to do that its the heart of the machine
1631859 these machines are such a large part of tacoma powers generating asset that if one should fail it could be out of service for one to two years if were not prepared for a rebuild
1631860 we have to do this before they blow up beyond repair
1631861 its been a long process and this is the first major milestone
1631862 well continue to work on the unit for the next two or three months
1631863 i believe that when you make a mess you need to clean it up and unfortunately the sad truth is that some companies evade that responsibility
1631864 and guess who pays the homeowners the workers the local businesses and the american taxpayer
1631865 as the legal representative of united states taxpayers who are the largest creditors in this multibillion dollar case the justice department has an obligation to help ensure whichever entity assumes control of asarcos asset will also be obligated to remediate the multistate toxic legacy of asarcos destructive environmental practices
1631866 it is time to tell companies that you cant use a bankruptcy law to get out of your environmental responsibilities
1631867 you cannot come into our towns with your hazardous materials and just walk away
1631868 it tastes like meat and it can look like meat but we can actually change the composition of the product quite a lot so we can mask the meaty flavour
1631869 it was very troubling to me we argued about that
1631870 clearly did not like some of things i was saying
1631871 i was told barbara in my administration you will have just cause termination i would not have taken the job otherwise
1631872 this case highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information
1631873 cases like these send a clear message to those who might be tempted to abuse our computer networks to steal information and harm law abiding people and businesses
1631874 this is the final chapter final salary pensions promise will soon be a thing of the past for private sector workers
1631875 public employees will become the pension elite for a while but cost pressures will burden future taxpayers too much
1631876 that ultimately sent nautilus and her crew across the top of the world on our historic mission
1631877 a man of average height standing on our sail could have reached up and touched the solid treacherous ice as we crept beneath it
1631878 it think its largely a commodity price story especially as weve seen oil prices start to look like they are on a downward trend
1631879 i think youre seeing some of that strength reverse as a result youre seeing some weakening in commodity based currencies including the canada dollar
1631880 generally were in an environment where the u s dollar seems to be on a bit of an upswing and thats adding further fuel to this depreciating trend for the canada dollar
1631881 just last week we had the monthly gdp contract again so that made it the third of four months that weve seen the canadian economy sort of shrink
1631882 thats shown that the weakness in the u s economy is having a real impact on canadas growth prospects and thats a also a reason that we started to see a bit of underperformance in the dollar
1631883 over the long term it will make manufacturers a little more competitive
1631884 unfortunately theyre also dealing with a u s economy thats looking very much to be in recession
1631885 if it stays down it probably will relieve some of the pressure on manufacturers and exporters
1631886 the people of hrm are strongly attached to our heritage buildings
1631887 over and over the ordinary citizens of halifax told us of the beauty of these buildings how important they are to the character of halifax and what a waste it would be if they were lost
1631888 functionally and economically obsolete and couldnt even be rented for warehouse space
1631889 totally opposed to anything that looks like a founders square approach to restoring historic buildings and using them to regenerate our downtown with prime office space
1631890 build a useable economically feasible and economically sustainable development that serves the greater purpose
1631891 to serve tenants who are going to hire the young people of nova scotia
1631892 what we would love to see and the best option would be is to have somebody occupy the upstairs of these buildings as offices or for some other use
1631893 so all the interesting features on the roof and in between the facades of these buildings should be maintained
1631894 on a scale from one to ten just how gay are you
1631895 the swimmers have been given the opportunity to choose whether or not to particpate in the opening ceremony
1631896 we have recommended if theyre swimming on the first two days that they strongly consider not with the demands of being on their feet
1631897 however its personal choice and some people are and some people are not swimming will be represented by nine swimmers and four staff the rest of us will be watching on tv with our feet up relaxing
1631898 also at the commonwealth games its always on the first day as well so ive never been to an opening ceremony but im here to swim and unfortunately i just have to miss it
1631899 but id rather swim the best race of my life rather than walk in the opening ceremony to tell the truth
1631900 i do have that option but i just feel i wont
1631901 its such an amazing feeling as you first walk in to the stadium and look up at the crowd with thousands of people cheering for each country
1631902 one of the reasons why i did it there was so if it happened again and i did have to skip it i wouldnt feel like i was missing out too much
1631903 were not runners or throwers that have to stand to do events preparing for our races we tend to be in relaxed mode from village to the eating hall to transport to the pool and back again we wont be doing much outside that zone
1631904 the little extra walking we did in japan for their pre games camp has made my legs feel a bit tighter and sorer than they normally would

1631913 we are pleased with the consistent progress that omv continues to make posting stronger six month results in all segments compared to the same period last year
1631914 in particular the upstream environment continues to be favourable with petrom once again contributing significantly to group results
1631915 however new upstream production together with ongoing efficiency initiatives at petrom should help offset these developments

1631924 from a human being standpoint you always wish for the best for others
1631925 you dont want anyone to ever have any kind of mental breakdown like that
1631926 but there are distractions every year at training camp the big thing is not to pay as much attention to it as the media does i mean if you want to feed your family you better worry about yourself and what you are doing first
1631927 the only thing ill say is that i know that coach reid has spent an awful lot of time with that situation ill talk about the players that are in camp here

1631932 stephen carter can really write i loved every page of palace council and am eager for more
1631933 carter twists plotlines like pretzels while wryly skewering americas wealthy intellectual elite
1631934 disguised as page turning summer reading that confirms all the worst suspicions of the american left and at times the right palace council gives grim song to the secrets that men keep in the imperfect world they have inherited
1631935 a fat delicious page turning trifecta its old fashioned family saga a political tour of several tumultuous american decades and a murder mystery
1631936 mr carters storytelling is underpinned by a masterly evocation of the world of wealthy and accomplished blacks in 20th century america
1631937 w ill grip readers but it will also make them think enthusiastically recommended

1631943 that is what replay is going to be there for and replay is coming very soon i cant give you a date but its going to be this year
1631944 there are a lot of factors in replay that i could go on and on about there are a lot of ballparks that are not umpire friendly when it comes to border calls thats how they build them theyre fan friendly and they dont want to change that
1631945 do we like that no but you know what were losing that war so well accept it and well move on and deal with however major league baseball wants us to deal with it and thats about all i can say about it but victorinos line drive is a perfect example of why they want replay
1631946 i look at it now and it looks like it just went foul just missed the pole foul ball after talking to the guys nobody was 100 percent sure one way or the other were not going to flip a call unless weve got it 100 percent
1631947 he goes i dont know i think you missed it but i dont know and he was the closest guy to it
1631948 from a technical standpoint why wouldnt we want to get the play right it seems like we were kind of behind the times and everybody knew what the call was except for the four guys umpires on the field
1631949 vilifying the extremely fat doesnt make people change their behaviour
1631950 here in the u s 74 percent of adults have heard of computer power management but 46 percent either wrongly identified it or didnt know what it is

1631974 so when eva said she was opening a new branch of beso in the gambling capital of the world victoria had the brainwave of turning it into a place which specialises in food and their favorite game eva will oversee the restaurant while victoria channels her energies into the casino

1631979 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves

1631981 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised

1632003 the floods of 2007 show just how serious flooding can be and i am glad to see that this project has been developed to enable people to have a greater understanding of the risk of flooding a number of decisions need to be taken when we look at managing the risk of flooding including our annual spend on flood defences where and how we build new houses and the emergency response procedures we have in place for times of flood this game gives the game player the opportunity to make informed decisions about all of these policy areas

1632127 these are not light switch moments what you have is more of a rheostat many many rheostat moments where in small areas local areas districts and eventually provinces there is an ongoing transition and has been an ongoing transition for the iraqi forces to step more into the lead and the coalition forces to step back and provide enablers
1632128 it is this exercise of pushing the stone up the hill a sisyphean endeavor at times where you do make two steps up and one step back sometimes you make one step up and two steps back but over the last year or so from the large comprehensive offensive launched in june 2007 when we had all of the surge brigades on the ground since that time there has been a fairly steady degree of improvement
1632129 do you have an idea of what victory would be in iraq or the global war on terror
1632130 the provincial elections law then it can be declared that they have met them plan objectives in the political line of operation
1632131 we have objectives for 2009 and an end state as well
1632132 is a country that is at peace with itself and its neighbors a government representative of and responsive to its people a productive member of the region and the global economy
1632133 we have considerable drill downs that describe the objectives relative to the security line of operations relative to the enemy relative to the iraqi forces the different types that are here
1632134 we didnt have an estimate for new aids cases before
1632135 on one hand perdue denounces the presence of outside groups and denies having any involvement with them

1632150 i didnt really have money just to fork out so it would have been a good time to take a break

1632155 i think its premature to calculate exactly how much the consumer has lost how much the retailers have lost at this point in time and how much the suspects financially gained
1632156 i suspect there are a lot of people that arent aware that their identifying information has been compromised
1632157 we chose the date because eight has always been our lucky number
1632158 i like the way it looks that its continuous said miss ebert a home depot cashier
1632159 we waited until 2008 because i like eight otherwise we would have gotten married earlier
1632160 its a 700 page bill which is why nobody understands it
1632161 there are some things we are supportive of some things we are mildly supportive of and others we are not wild about
1632162 no doubt this is a big bill and there is a lot in it for everybody its not a panacea but its a reasonable first response
1632163 galveston is open for business and we certainly welcome the tourists back to the island
1632164 texas is grateful that this storm did not escalate to hurricane strength before making landfall on our shores

1632167 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
1632168 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
1632169 it is fortunate that this incident didnt end in a very ugly gunfight
1632170 it is not an incident that we are aware of
1632171 an all out struggle to deter criminal organizations from operating on both sides of our common border
1632172 with this compromise north san jose will strike an important balance between housing jobs and schools

1632174 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves

1632180 is it ok if i order another beer or will these people think im a lush
1632181 will my wife think these concert tickets are out of our budget
1632182 consumption of calories has gone up but that does not tell us why people are eating more
1632183 some have argued that obesity has been produced by cheaper food but if fatness is a response to greater purchasing power why do we routinely observe that rich people are thinner than poor people
1632184 its a bit cheeky to pin it on sociological influences theres more to it than that
1632185 if you are surrounded by people whether thats friends or within the family home who are overweight you are sharing the same environment where there is likely to be an abundance of the wrong kind of foods
1632186 gil got indicted in my opinion because former elected ag doug moylan wanted to get even with carl gutierrez and his group the worst thing you can have is politicians becoming prosecutors doug wanted to go after his political enemies and let loose his dogs on people like gil the legislature regardless of the merits of some of the cases they have theres so much havoc thats been created in the government because the elected attorney general think it doesnt have to listen to government agencies

1632194 the administration is not opposed to gpd getting a pay raise so im not sure where youre getting this idea
1632195 the biggest insult is that theres a 10 000 for a staff member that walks alongside the governor but he is not in favor of giving the men and women who protects him and his family on a daily basis hes opposed to giving them a 4 000 increase
1632196 to hear an excuse of we dont have the money and to know that other agencies have been getting the raises without any question as far as where the monies coming from and for us here a short handed department being told to wait like everyone else i feel its wrong
1632197 its about time that we deserve that raise we deserve more than 30 or 39 ive been in the department for quite a while and this is something ive been expecting for a long time
1632198 this is an enormous win win for both companies that will leverage sales and operational capabilities of fulcrum group and the tremendous customer relationships and global reputation of butterfield bank group

1632201 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1632202 im glad that he stepped up to this but lets be clear he doesnt have any support in his own party yet for this and unless he can get republicans to agree with his point of view we could be here for an extended period of time
1632203 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1632204 labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1632205 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
1632206 permission to state the following on his behalf i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
1632207 what we have seen over the past few days has been a mix of improper disclosures of partial information mixed with inaccurate information and then drawn into unfounded conclusions none of that serves the victims their families or the public
1632208 always moves aggressively to get to the bottom of the facts but that does not include mistreatment of anybody and i dont know of any case where thats happened
1632209 that doesnt mean that from time to time people dont make mistakes
1632210 the fbi had asked everybody to sign these non disclosure things
1632211 people are just stretched beyond their means at this time
1632212 im voting for the county hospital bonds and the school bonds in my area and thats it
1632213 it will be a low budget campaign and theres not much margin for error
1632214 i think we have to be as cautious as possible to get the best chance of passage
1632215 what weve found running initiative campaigns for more than 20 years is that silicon valley voters are really smart and they vote for what is in their best interest

1632219 universities can reach out but they have to reach out to everyone

1632221 last year there were 10 counties from california that did not send a single student to berkeley ten
1632222 there is some additional flexibility afforded to students in terms of their outreach and how they design outreach
1632223 we call the schools and get the demographics of how many african americans go to that school then we put together thousands of packets with fliers like an introduction to the university financial aid how to write essays
1632224 we go to the classes that have never heard of berkeley before
1632225 they are passionate about what theyre doing because they care
1632226 the students have seen the need for greater diversity and have taken it upon themselves to assist and supplement the universitys effort

1632239 well it probably cant be reversed from what i can see at this point but as long as the receiver works with haulers and the community in order to get to where they want to go which is to reduce the flow of trash into ordot well be ok
1632240 theres always challenges involved when youre requiring people to make changes gbb is not unsympathetic to the concerns of haulers but the fact remains that ordot is running out of space and it would be a disaster if it runs out of space before the new landfill opens
1632241 theyre doing the best they can within a real tough situation they have to make ordot last two more years thats their goal
1632242 itll bring unity and well also have other events that will bring unity as well this is just one of the events for customs week
1632243 i still dont have my school aides on board were trying to recruit aggressively im still short quite a number of teachers so i need those staff in place in order for the students to come into the classroom and theres someone there for them
1632244 she will make call sometime later this week for us probably to delay the opening of the school
1632245 its real important i know this is the time when the legislature is looking at our budget but really having a lot of students in the school requires that we give them the resources manpower wise that we make sure that theyre getting the best learning environment and that theyre in a safe learning environment im just hoping that everything will fall through were hoping the legislature will fully endorse and support our budget

1632261 online virtual worlds electronic environments where people can work and interact in a somewhat realistic manner have great potential as sites for research in the social behavioral and economic sciences as well as in human centered computer science this article uses second life and world of warcraft as two very different examples of current virtual worlds that foreshadow future developments introducing a number of research methodologies that scientists are now exploring including formal experimentation observational ethnography and quantitative analysis of economic markets or social networks are exploring the methods needed to create an entirely new generation of games called pervasive larps live action role playing games that have players act in the real world while simultaneously interacting over the internet via wireless mobile connections
1632262 we are very excited to see this new technology released to the flash industry

1632264 people who have published about wow will briefly describe their completed work and the abstracts and links will be available on the wiki others who are currently engaged in research will explain what they are doing at somewhat greater length including any preview of results in response to questions the concluding part of the session will be a debate about future in wow projects that would be valuable to do especially those that students might use as term papers and dissertations
1632265 although most of each session will be spontaneous discussion a happy bedlam of ideas information and hypotheses some material needs to be prepared ahead of time and may be easiest to manage during the session by judicious use of chat macros
1632266 the relationship of the wow economic system to the economy of the surrounding world interesting comparisons between wow and other games or virtual worlds allegorical features of wow in such areas as colonialism and state corruption the importation of real world social movements into wow like environmentalism this virtual world as an arena for players who want to explore alternative personalities and roles the impact of wow on players whether educational or possibly harmful
1632267 this session will analyze the future course of development of wow and other virtual worlds at a time when many highly involved observers have expressed concern that progress is stalling even as other observers imagine we are passing a breakthrough threshold after which virtual worlds will become central to society the failure of sims online the continuing technical issues with second life and the fact that no other mmorpg seems able to surpass wow are warning signs recall that active worlds is over a decade old and there is little hope that home computers or internet connectivity will be vastly more capable over the next five years it is possible that rapid future progress will actually depend upon us because the success of a virtual world will depend upon the socio cultural design qualities that make it serve human needs and our research will contribute to the fund of knowledge supporting innovative design ten questions to begin with

1632276 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1632277 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1632278 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1632279 they clearly requested that the interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1632280 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice

1632285 tariffs and import quotas usually reduce the general welfare of society
1632286 democracies frequently adopt and maintain policies harmful for most people
1632287 protectionism is a classic example economists across the political spectrum have pointed out the folly of protectionism for centuries but almost every democracy restricts imports
1632288 they felt it would be helpful if senior officials in government met with candidates who were from outside the province even outside the country in order to sell them on the promotion of the province what a great place it is to live and to work
1632289 i would challenge anyone out there to point to an example of where government has interfered at all with the academic autonomy at memorial
1632290 we have just deliberately not gotten involved we have not interfered in any manner at all
1632291 this was a situation where they invited us to participate and we did and we did openly and honestly
1632292 i honestly dont see anything wrong with that her involvement and i am sure the people of this province dont
1632293 weve been elected by the people of this province to be responsible for the public purse and the public treasury to make sure that its handled and its managed responsibly and thats all were doing here

1632297 its not every day you get a letter from the chemical producers and the sierra club co signed
1632298 the fact that were working in this pressure cooker that anybody can basically torpedo this process by pulling out of it is whats keeping us together
1632299 we all want an alternative to what the federal government originally proposed i think theres a consensus that there are some real fundamental flaws in it
1632300 so we all know that we can only come up with that alternative if we all keep working together
1632301 in some areas we see very high ambient air emissions and in other areas we see less

1632327 it is difficult to guess the file is in the department of telecom but if the government fails to convince the union and goes ahead with the ipo plan things could be difficult the union has over three lakh employees and the network of 31 million fixed line and 38 million gsm mobile subscribers depend on them

1632337 i did say something else which i cant repeat but as it happens i did exactly that
1632338 history has shown that most games i have played for england the oval has been pretty lucky for me throughout my career
1632339 most test matches there i have taken five wickets i have this confidence about the oval
1632340 dev talks about getting hit on the head which spurred him on to bowl so fast but he got a roasting from mike at the end of their first innings
1632341 he was bowling at their tailenders allan donald and de villiers and pitching the ball up and getting driven
1632342 mike wanted him to bang a few bouncers into them but i dont know whether its the fast bowlers union but devon didnt want to do it
1632343 i dont know whether that roasting inspired him to bowl faster in the second innings
1632344 i came into bat and i heard one of the guys say let him have one
1632345 i thought it was a bluff and was expecting a yorker but fanie bowled the perfect bouncer at my head
1632346 thats when i waved my bat at the slips and i said you guys are history
1632347 his bowling was very hostile and aggressive but he bowled very straight
1632348 he didnt give the batsman too many options he got peter kirsten with a top edge caught by defreitas on the boundary from that moment on nobody took him on for the hook shot and he peppered them
1632349 he bowled the perfect armpit ball to gary kirsten which he ended up lobbing back to devon a caught and bowled which was a rare thing for devon
1632350 if you look on the footage he was in the perfect forward defence position but the ball bowled him half an hour before he put the bat down
1632351 a couple of balls before that i went around the wicket and he was fending the ball from around his earholes then i pitched the ball up over the wicket thats what a good fast bowler does because he was tentative from the short pitched stuff
1632352 he was in my face and i said dazza why did you spoil my party laughed malcolm
1632353 young goughy thought his one wicket worth more than my nine he said i reckon ive got the best batsman out
1632354 i recently played a twenty20 match for the pca against the bajan xi there and it almost clicked again
1632355 i wish i could have the oval pitch in my back yard i just love playing there i feel as if its my own i dont care who im playing there
1632356 if needed the government will challenge in supreme court the order of the special tribunal
1632357 the fleet of vehicles we stood to inherit following substantial growth of our metering business within the south west had average co2 emissions of 174g km
1632358 the co2 emissions of our vans particularly in inner city areas like london are a key consideration for us hence the reason well be looking seriously at the brand new peugeot bipper van for 2009 it benefits both the environment and our expenditure
1632359 we are often tasked with meeting the demands of specific fleet requirements such as edf energys low co2 emissions policy
1632360 by offering edf energy the partner origin it will considerably reduce its transport co2 emissions while greatly lowering the company fuel bills with high fuel economy and low tax rates edf energys fleet managers can address the current escalating fuel costs by operating economic vehicles we have a very modern range of lcvs to help companies comply with environmental obligations while reducing their costs
1632361 when i became director in 2003 i had decided to intensify efforts towards massive infrastructural facilities development because it forms the basis of attracting the universities and colleges of education to attend the immersion and acculturation programs
1632362 indeed the teaching and learning of any language will only be possible with the provision of some basic facilities like modern language laboratories professional language instructors and good environment for immersion and acculturation
1632363 we are fed up with the current vacation declared by the state government
1632364 i want to go back to school so that i will complete my lessons and write my terminal examinations
1632365 i want to resume in school to enable me to begin the process of completing my primary education
1632366 we are concerned about the diminishing standards of professional excellence that does not augur well for us as lawyers we are going to push up the requirements of the qualifying students if it means passing out only two students per year
1632367 we are not going to succumb to populism lawyers are people of excellence and we are not going to bring the standards down
1632368 a lawyers biggest asset is his or her integrity it is possible to earn a decent living without engaging in unprofessional conduct
1632369 jobs start with you create your own opportunities and employ yourself
1632370 we can now go to school the strike has been suspended
1632371 what if the examination starts now what will i write i have forgotten everything i did not have time to read i was busy selling and sometimes watching films now this whole thing has been suspended
1632372 you see why i wished the school was in session we would have been thinking more of our books than making money now that we have some money looking at the naira notes in her hands but what is in our head
1632373 but all hope is not lost we can start reading but can we recover everything i just pray that they dont go on strike again because i heard it was only suspended
1632374 i pray the government will grant their request so that all this strike palaver will stop
1632375 i have been doing this for my aunt since the strike started and i make a lot of money because customers dey come well well
1632376 that is my brother samson we are both in the same school he is in primary 4 in my school too but he used to stay here with me to make calls
1632377 because i cannot read well unlike my brother who can read fairly well i dont know how to read that is why i want the school to resume so that i will learn how to read
1632378 while the strike lasted i was watching the english premiership i had enough time to do that since there was no school my best team is manchester united and my best player is christiano ronaldo but whenever there was any football match at all on television i watched until there was power outage and when the light goes out i run to put on the radio to listen to the analysis thank god brila fm was there to give all the updates because of that i decided to buy a small radio set so that i can hear the latest happening in the sporting world
1632379 even though it involved spending money at least i was keeping myself busy with that
1632380 i had enough time to watch second chance and ultimate search if my school was not on strike my parents would not have allowed me spend so much time as i do with television
1632381 if they dont go on strike the government will not give them what they want
1632382 when i tell them to do something them go do another thing sometimes they no go do wetin i tell them to do i come dey wonder sey na so teachers dey suffer with these children for school because me wey get six children he dey hard for me to control them talk more of teachers wey go get like 100 for their classes how them they manage that is why i think sey make government give wetin them they ask for because teachers dey work pass anybody
1632383 they were playing all through like this one pointing at one of her sons who she called joshua i did not see him at home throughout yesterday they hardly read their books because i have many boys they always play football with their friends and when they come home it is to eat food maybe because they were at home most of the time the amount of food they were consuming was too much but that did not bother me as much as the academic setback that they had as a result of the strike they were supposed to have finished their 3rd term exams and be on holiday like their counterparts in the private schools just then the strike started is the government saying we should not have confidence in their schools anymore the government schools are becoming unstable unlike the private schools but the government must know that half of nigerians cannot afford private schools for their children which is why the government must make the welfare of teachers and the living conditions in these schools very conducive
1632384 particular importance should be attached to salary and the level of appreciation of the importance of teachers functions as in other comparable professions
1632385 salary scales for teachers should be reviewed periodically to take into account such factors as a rise in the cost of living increased productivity leading to higher standards of living in the country or a general upward movement in wage or salary levels
1632386 the university gives an allowance of two years to every programme but it becomes worse when some students just walk away without notifying the university authorities we cannot know the number of students in an academic year
1632387 we have to know why they have failed to complete their delay in finishing strains us because we cannot admit more students since their continued stay on the programme affects admission
1632388 this makes kisu the biggest international school in the east african region and further cements ugandas position as the regions favorite destination for all parents in search of the best education for their children
1632389 in line with the strategy we want to position our education institutions as the best both in facilities student handling and mentoring
1632390 in pursuance of that goal we have already been granted the rights to offer the ib diploma effective this september
1632391 the ib diploma means that our students will find it much easier to get admitted to any university of their choice across the world including well known ones like oxford yale and the sorbonne
1632392 it is not fun to go to school for over eight years and then fail to get a job or even create your own job we need to revive education and do away with what isnt working
1632393 for many education has been theoretical and has only been explained in text books
1632394 but we are giving academia with practical skills it has a structured system with flexibility
1632395 we want to build ugandans for the markets of the world not just africa as a christian university gods values will be in every aspect of life

1632403 we received the report on friday morning that the school was facing an electricity blackout which has affected the supply of water however we have come up with stringent measures to deal with the matter

1632415 it is essential that we have the most suitable postal network to enable us to compete effectively in the years ahead
1632416 mail volumes have fallen by 7 since 2005 and stamped mail is predicted to decline a further 30 in the next three years we need to invest to defend our market share and to retain existing business and win new customers

1632423 i am thrilled with the award and i am grateful to all who helped me to realise my dream i dedicate this award to all the brighter students who could not make it into the competition because they could not raise bus and airfares to camping sites
1632424 i am convinced students from remote parts of the country are capable of excelling in the olympiad examinations but are being sidelined because they can not fund themselves in the competition i therefore appeal to government the corporate world and the non governmental organisations to come to the their rescue
1632425 research remains the foundation of any self reliant economy academia are key stakeholders in economic growth through the production of new knowledge successful economic development requires progressive innovations patents that will improve the competitiveness of existing industries as well as lead to the creation of new industries
1632426 when that new knowledge is quantified in a market environment it creates fuller employment capital formation growing profits and surpluses for reinvestment in other words it is from research that new companies are born that new jobs are created it is from research that new wealth is created and the economy expands

1632444 love one another it has been said is the supreme law but what power made it so upon what rational authority does the gospel of love rest why should i not hate my enemies if i love them does that not place me at their mercy is it natural for enemies to do good unto each other and what is good can the torn and bloody victim love the blood splashed jaws that rend him limb from limb are we not all predatory animals by instinct if humans ceased wholly from preying on each other could they continue to exist is not lust and carnal desire a more truthful term to describe love when applied to the continuance of the race is not the love of the fawning scriptures a euphemism for sexual activity or was the great teacher a glorifier of eunuchs love your enemies and do good to them that hate and use you is this not the despicable philosophy of the spaniel that rolls upon its back when kicked hate your enemies with a whole heart and if a man smite you on one cheek smash him on the other smite him hip and thigh for self preservation is the highest law he who turns the other cheek is a cowardly dog give blow for blow scorn for scorn doom for doom with compound interest liberally added thereunto eye for eye tooth for tooth aye four fold a hundred fold make yourself a terror to your adversary and when he goeth his way he will possess much additional wisdom to ruminate over thus shall you make yourself accepted in all walks of life and you spirit your immortal spirit shall live not in an intangible paradise but in the brains and sinews of those whose respect you have gained

1632451 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1632452 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1632453 at these high injected doses we hoped to see drug like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment
1632454 our hypothesis was that certain non toxic dietary agents that had the ability to promote reactive oxygen species ros would break down pancreatic cancer cell resistance to therapy following administration of mda 7 il 24 and be safe for human use
1632455 we are very excited at the prospect of this chemoprevention gene therapy as a means of both preventing and treating pancreatic cancer and it has significant potential to move rapidly into human clinical trials
1632456 in june 2008 gao reported low 2007 spending rates by the iraqi government for some critical sectors
1632457 the iraqi government generated an estimated 96 billion in cumulative revenues of which crude oil export sales accounted for about 90 2 billion or 94 percent
1632458 u s taxpayers have paid approximately 48 billion for stabilization and reconstruction activities in iraq according to the gao report the iraqi government generated an estimated 96 billion in revenues from 2005 to 2007 94 percent of which are attributable to oil revenues for 2008 the gao estimates that iraq will generate an additional 73 billion to 86 billion in revenues primarily driven by the high price of oil resulting in a budget surplus of as much as 50 3 billion
1632459 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people

1632511 in the 2005 festival we hosted ireland and i got a chance to meet the irish coach ed randolph he and i started talking about how great it would be to do a return visit and 2008 was the year to go
1632512 we stayed in groups of three at our host families in bray and dublin and played games during the first four days
1632513 we were quicker faster more in shape but they were very much stronger
1632514 the irish players had a different style of playing get it down low and score
1632515 we did pretty good we won two and lost one
1632516 the only team we lost to have two players who played on the national team
1632517 i really liked staying in dublin i liked the city but the cliffs of mohr were the greatest thing ive ever seen

1632524 weve had excellent police coverage in our schools in the past and well have to see how this works out
1632525 the grade 5 d a r e drug and alcohol resistance education program will be a loss
1632526 however as you are aware the amount budgeted for overtime has not increased in the last two budget cycles
1632527 in order to compensate for what will inevitably be a shortfall in this budget line i must reinstate the floating position throughout the year to cover vacation time
1632528 also have patrolmen spend more time in our schools during their normally scheduled patrol hours

1632544 we have a bucket on the counter for the york community food pantry and i had noticed there was some bills in there
1632545 i saw some bills and i opened the top and i saw a 50 bill so i pulled it out and i realized it wasnt one it was six six 50 bills i counted it once i counted it again i counted it three times

1632563 they did some very innovative things to keep people going and their experience rewards system was something that we paid a lot of attention to
1632564 i think its a great game and single player obviously is fantastic they did a hell of a job with their set pieces of scripting certain moments that they were really sure the player was going to actually see and experience first hand the way that they use those moments to craft the player experience halo has a lot to learn from
1632565 the lot was gravel and there would always be an indentation which made it dangerous for people who were traveling on 103
1632566 people are parking more parallel to the road rather than haphazardly along the side
1632567 i go to the beach very often and i see young children playing in the storm runoff
1632568 i wanted to post it so people would be aware
1632569 our cottage is close to a storm drain and some days the water will be pretty odiferous
1632570 you have to walk through that water if you want to walk along the beach
1632571 many folks dont think about the fact that what they do in upland areas can influence beach and ocean water quality
1632572 for instance when we do beach cleanups the no 1 item we pick up are cigarette butts these come mostly from storm drains not people throwing their butts on the beach
1632573 the water quality is very good at all of our beaches
1632574 typically speaking our beaches are testing clean all the time
1632575 we have been doing extensive testing in the outfall at short sands
1632576 we tested in the outfall and followed the brook testing seven places above it all of them passed
1632577 its brackish water coming out of swamps and across peoples yards and out of parking lots it heads for the lowest point which is the beach
1632578 we use it as an indicator as to whether or not there are issues somewhere else
1632579 the question now is what is the source is it a manure pile upstream or agriculture or a leaky septic system
1632580 we dont want issues on the beach when it is too late
1632581 being a part of a merger like this is a strange situation because obviously the new organisation has to look over all of its assets everything it owns and its strategy for the future
1632582 apparently they didnt want an rts studio in europe and to be honest we would have loved to have worked with activision but were pretty confident in our capabilities and there are not many studios that can match our quality
1632583 were working on the console versions of world in conflict together with swordfish
1632584 in the past year or so weve been increasing our console capabilities going from pc to having a really good understanding of console as well
1632585 thats part of the whole situation now in theory they could sell world in conflict separately from massive i think that any buyer would like to make sure it goes together but we dont own it activision owns it so thats their call
1632586 i think that right now everyone is in wait and see mode and just want to know what the future holds
1632587 be careful with your purse or someone will steal it
1632588 if we are correct about the price drop it would position the xbox 360s low end sku as the lowest priced next gen console below nintendos wii for the first time its high end sku would be price comparable to sonys new 399 ps3 sku
1632589 overall consoles have seen an average unit increase of 53 in the month of after a price cut
1632590 theyd say this has nothing to do with me or i dont know enough about this
1632591 they did not seem to be very involved politically at all

1632593 i was part of the process during that part of my life civil rights anti war protests
1632594 this is their country and this is their future we just want them to be participate
1632595 that was important to me that we open up a dialogue so that people leave talking about what affects them

1632627 this initial rollout provides consumers increasingly convenient access to their favorite movies and is one more step in the fulfillment of our mission to transform blockbuster into a multichannel provider of media entertainment
1632628 it means kiosks are going to be a big part of the marketplace in the coming years
1632629 the blockbuster brand has enough equity to do this if they play it right
1632630 it really depends on the experience the consumer gets and how aggressive blockbuster moves to retrain the consumer to the new rental model people don t change that easily
1632631 i dont see kiosks substituting the in store experience but i see them as a supplement
1632632 we are delighted that complete has been selected as one of kensingtons packager panel going forward we strongly believe that our business aims ethics and commitment to working with lenders such as kensington have helped us in successfully retaining so many sought after agencies we are one of only a very select few packager firms who have retained agencies with kensington beacon platform and salt a consequence of this is that in todays market we still have a wide panel and are therefore able to offer an enviable choice to brokers seeking a solution for their clients rather than being able to offer access to just a few lenders
1632633 as banking technology evolves and people have to remember more passwords and pins many of us now prefer to keep things simple and use one provider that they can trust to provide good value across the board
1632634 offering secured loans has always been part of our expansion plans and we have built in the capability to distribute underwrite and process second charge products while the supply of funds remains restricted within the mortgage lending sector link loans will be distributed through a limited panel of distributors that has already been set up and we are very optimistic about the opportunities that the secured loan market represents
1632635 this scheme is designed for any first time buyer from students moving through further education to people in their 20s and even 30s who have been unable to buy a home
1632636 indeed it can make a real difference in peoples circumstances on getting onto the property ladder or not
1632637 this survey conjured up some very interesting points and certainly helped us garner a better understanding of what brokers are looking for to get the most out of this important sector of the market a good mortgage club should offer brokers added value in order to help them increase sales income and at tma we will certainly be looking at elements from this survey to bring a strong proposition to the market that will be of true benefit to our members
1632638 the end of the housing market boom with house prices dropping ought to be good news for first time buyers who can finally be in a position to afford the home that was out of reach lenders are getting tougher on how much they will lend and what level of deposit theyll demand which means first time buyers are yet to see much benefit from the house price slide

1632655 we wanted to show a way of displaying the art you have your partner has your grandmother left you and this is one idea of how you can put it together
1632656 its really appropriate in san francisco because people tend to have small homes
1632657 and with all the architectural elements the victorians have theres a perfect wall to do this
1632658 large is relative to the space but all small would be ticky tacky and all large would be overwhelming
1632659 there are always many solutions but which is the one that feels like home
1632660 the spacing becomes irregular as you get toward the middle
1632661 there was no in between and what there was wasnt very stylish
1632662 we want to talk to them and walk them through the process
1632663 we posted a lot of jobs everywhere and of the three people i hired somebody from webguild we posted our job on the webguild job posting and that was one of the only ones that i actually got a resume that i thought was interesting
1632664 we respectfully disagree and are considering the appropriate next steps in this matter
1632665 we can now provide high quality dvr capabilities to almost all of our customers in a very short period of time
1632666 it changes cables competitive posture against satellite it makes the services less expensive to provide and it makes it easier to upgrade the services
1632667 cablevision has been innovative here and i think other cable companies will follow them
1632668 in short order effective dvr penetration could now jump to north of 60 percent of cable households that is all digital cable subscribers
1632669 that means a huge increase in the number of viewing hours per day potentially subject to ad skipping
1632670 it allows advertisers to do things they cant do on a physical dvr
1632671 lets say you record an episode of lost three months later you want to play it back the advertising that was on lost is stale and no longer applies but the capability to refresh the advertising exists if the content owner wants to do that with the cable operator
1632672 the continued repeat business and the incredible movie itself just speak volumes
1632673 why did we choose to use products for our test case

1632678 i served on that board for only a few weeks before resigning as soon as i became aware of public allegations against another member of the board
1632679 since concerns have been raised about that brief time i am stepping down to avoid distracting from barack obamas message of change
1632680 it was a way for me to show emerging artists in a public setting
1632681 most of the people interested in such spaces want access to the amenities of the neighborhood such as hip restaurants shops and startup business offices without the upkeep of a large apartment theyd only use for sleeping
1632682 because this is how we should all be thinking now
1632683 i used to have italian tiles in my kitchen and every time a drop of lemon juice or wine got on them it would stain
1632684 i would spend 3 000 every six months to have the italian tile people come out and scrub it with harsh chemicals and seal them with harsh chemicals there was too much anxiety about them i was a slave to these tiles
1632685 i designed clothes for 10 years for sears and know that something cant just be beautiful
1632686 its very zen very soothing and then my son plays his drums in there and thats not as soothing

1632690 blocked their own path to europe with this act of destruction
1632691 a huge living box which was my home was floating in the open seas near to an anchored leisure boat my friends and i were both at sea and contemplated events in the distance suddenly i saw a fire on the deck of the boat if the fire is not extinguished immediately my box will catch fire too i thought i swam over and tried to spray water onto the fire but it was pointless the fire blazed higher and higher my friends swam over in my direction and signalled to me that i should get away from the fire as quickly as possible the reflection of the fire became fixed in the water i woke up and was helpless where should i go now
1632692 i am standing next to a stone wall behind which a fire is raging soon the fire will jump over the wall i have to get away as soon as possible but the most important thing is to take the children with me faster faster i urge them then we are standing in front of an underground bunker we cross the threshold and then the doors close behind us one more minute and we would have been dead i think relieved in the second dream the world was about to be destroyed i have to get dressed and go away
1632693 and that i wont need any good clothes any more ill take them off and just keep the warm things a boy of fifteen or so is with me it is high time we close the door shut ourselves off from this terrible world the boy and i close the doors secure them with heavy bars but the feeling lingers that this will not offer us enough protection
1632694 i went from one room into the next checking how secure the doors were in short i was looking for a safe place
1632695 expectation fear of an anti semitic pogrom i walk through a horse wagon covered in brightly coloured material and think to myself that it would be immediately destroyed in a pogrom and would offer no protection to anyone from somewhere up above children are shooting at me with water pistols then they join hands and form a chain which is coming towards me i walk towards them certain that i can talk them out of their plan
1632696 misha this is my name m r and i are at some social gathering among a big group of people out of nowhere fascists i have no doubt that they are fascists although they are wearing neither uniforms nor swastikas start laying into misha no one tries to help him i suddenly realise that we are completely vulnerable in this crowd of people i feel helpless and dejected there is no way out any more
1632697 misha talks very harshly and openly about politics i see a machine gun aimed at him i know that they want to get rid of him and i protect him with my body then they shoot me everything around me goes dark and i smell the scent of mishas aftershave does that mean im completely dead i ask myself
1632698 i am in prison and im sitting on a metal bed next to a grey prison blanket suddenly i see mikhail khordorkovsky beside me he says that he has heard of the lawsuit against me then he lies down on the bed and pulls the blanket up to his chin and how are you getting on here misha i ask him badly he answers and when he briefly gets out of the bed i notice that his face is as white as rice paper and that his eyes have a feverish glow i understand that this person has been through a lot i feel deep compassion for him
1632699 i find myself behind a sort of curtain in a tent
1632700 suddenly water is flowing out of me and the water contains traces of blood more blood is coming out all the time and it attracts hordes of angry people who flock towards me like vultures i immediately realise they want to kill me because they think i am a witch

1632706 we have a lot to learn from their success they did some very innovative things to keep people going and their experience rewards system was something that we paid a lot of attention to i think its a great game and single player is obviously fantastic
1632707 they did a hell of a job with their set pieces of scripting certain moments that they were really sure the player was going to actually see and experience first hand the way that they use those moments to craft the player experience halo has a lot to learn from
1632708 a lot of time players dont experience it or they dont see the thing going on or they maybe dont experience it in quite the same way we expected them to
1632709 i think halo has always been an extremely simulation driven game simulation i think adds replayability it adds depth to the game but it also makes scripting much more difficult and it means designers have a much harder time

1632746 he didnt say what he expects but its not hard to figure it out hell call for more german participation during international crises hell call for more german soldiers
1632747 no matter how you might feel about this a president obama would be germanys friend and a fan of berlin
1632748 he explicitly called for german soldiers for afghanistan he did not say more soldiers but that was what he meant
1632749 and obama also indicated this he will want support as president to wind up the iraq adventure
1632750 hesitant white voters in ohio and pennsylvania colorado and virginia
1632751 he wants to convince voters that the world will also listen to a black president and theres one other thing one shouldnt forget when talking about obama
1632752 if it were possible some would put themselves in the place of the wounded so they could get out of there and would not have to endure the pain and suffering that is on all of our minds some would give up organs for these men and women yet obama could not even go to that place for even a brief visit

1632777 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1632778 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1632779 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1632780 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1632781 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1632782 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1632783 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1632784 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1632785 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation
1632786 i have no idea why john mccain doesnt support it it hurts him in indiana and missouri and ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear

1632800 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights

1632818 in the absence to a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for our incentives package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive given that we dont have a decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1632819 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next step
1632820 the phone talks today will be to decide on a common reponse there is the possibility of trying to send the matter back to the security council but there is always the problem of persuading china and russia
1632821 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures

1632823 i am not jose mourinho so why compare me with him mourinho says i will win 10 championships but i am more modest than that
1632824 i am from south brazil and in my culture we never say i will win this or that i just say that i will try my best to win all the competitions
1632825 but mourinho is mourinho he has a different culture to me
1632826 maybe in the past they have spent more money but now they dont need to spend as much because they already have a solid base now they need a coach to develop young players and i think i am that coach
1632827 it is a thigh strain we need to wait but it could be one week
1632828 it was another good work out it was a good game with four goals for us and good play
1632829 but the players arent 100 yet that would be difficult right now the other team were fitter than us but you could see we were passing pressing and the understanding between the players was better i am really pleased with the result
1632830 normally when you have quality when you are playing well and creating chances you will score goals
1632831 the core of the team is still the same of course we had a little thing with cristiano ronaldo this summer but we have a good squad of players
1632832 during the season we are bound to suffer setbacks every team does
1632833 there will be injuries loss of form red cards and clearly we need luck at crucial times as well but hopefully we will end up in the right place
1632834 it is almost too tight to split them and results over the last few years confirm that
1632835 you can see from our results in europe how much quality there is in the premier league so i expect us all to be quite close to each other

1632846 we know that environmental cues are significant in many addictions including tobacco and alcohol and contribute to relapses
1632847 this study identifies the specific neuronal process involved and helps explain relapse even after rehabilitative therapy or long term abstinence
1632848 these potentiated synapses are persistent regardless of what your new behaviour is and because the memory is still maintained it could trigger relapse when the conditions are repeated
1632849 this is a clear validation that drug addiction is a life long disease three months for a rat could equal several years in a human although drug taking behaviours may be absent the memory makes relapse not only possible but likely
1632850 this suggests the possibility of developing an amphetamine like drug for treating cocaine addiction
1632851 the research also demonstrates the usefulness for conducting studies in monkeys to test potential treatments
1632852 while we have medications for heroin and tobacco abuse there is no fda approved treatment for cocaine
1632853 with this strategy in mind clinical researchers have turned to drugs currently available including amphetamines
1632854 while its unlikely that amphetamine itself will turn out to be the best treatment these drugs allow us to prove the concept of using a replacement drug to combat cocaine addiction
1632855 this procedure measures the strength of the reinforcing effects of drugs
1632856 each injection requires more and more work and eventually it gets to the point where its not worth it to the monkey because more than 1 000 presses are required
1632857 this was a very positive finding exactly what we had hoped to see
1632858 for a disease that has been transformed from almost uniformly fatal to manageable over decades the impact of treatment decisions is substantial
1632859 disease management remains challenged by toxicities maintenance of adherence clinical manifestations related to both the drugs and the hiv infection itself and the threat of drug resistance sustainability and expansion of the progress achieved will depend on maintaining a robust drug development pipeline and the ability to deliver effective therapy and monitoring tools to the worlds affected populations
1632860 in dopamine transporter deficient mice these effects on metabolism are clearly independent of cocaines effects on dopamine
1632861 these metabolic factors may be a strong regulator of cocaine use and abuse and may also suggest new avenues for addiction treatments
1632862 our offer is clear and their response is not clear
1632863 the iranian government needs to respond in a very clear way to the generous offer from the international community
1632864 as predicted it basically says yes we will give you an answer but when you give us an answer
1632865 in the absence to a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for our incentives package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive given that we dont have a decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1632866 this has been the iranian strategy for years to bide their time and continue with their enrichment
1632867 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next steps before i get in front of them
1632868 we dont have the decent and responsive statement from the iranians

1632878 when you get up in the morning you do not think about triangles and squares and these similes that psychologists have been using for the past 100 years you think about status you think about where you are in relation to your peers youre thinking about your spouse about your kids about your boss ninety nine percent of your time is spent thinking about other peoples thoughts about you their intentions and all this kind of stuff so sorting all that out how we navigate this complex social world theres going to be a neuroscience to it and i think its going to be very powerful

1632903 ive recently had cause to spend social time with a group of vocal atheists sic who dont know that im a christian theyve unwittingly taught me that if you dont worship god you invariably end up worshipping yourself and with that comes viciousness self righteousness and an almost unbelievable lack of charity and forgiveness suddenly the greatest virtue is self actualisation and the greatest sinner is anyone who stands between you and what you want a world full of self worshippers would not be a rational paradise itd be a living nightmare
1632904 total despair of any good coming from the petition or of those things which are called conciliatory measures
1632905 i constantly insisted that all such measures instead of having any tendency to produce a reconciliation would only be considered as proofs of our timidity and want of confidence in the ground we stood on and would only encourage our enemies to greater exertions against us

1632945 israel displayed an excellent ear and fine false turn of phrase during the 15 or so months in the early 1990s when she sold hundreds of phony celebrity letters and a lot of filched real ones to about 30 different dealers now all these years later shes written a slender sordid and pretty damned fabulous book about her misadventures if i were a librarian i wouldnt let lee israel through the door but id certainly make sure i had her latest book on the shelves if i were an editor id sign her up to write a biography of louise brooks and not just to keep her out of trouble
1632946 the effect of this book on me was to make me like ammon shea and briefly to hate english what a choking god awful mash it is surely french is better then i recovered and saw its greatness afresh the o e d shea notes is a catalog of the foibles of the human condition shea has walked the wildwood of our gnarled ancient speech and returned singing incomprehensible sounds in a language that turns out to be our own
1632947 doris lessing once declared that fiction makes a better job of the truth than straightforward reminiscence and while that might well be true of her celebrated and semi autobiographical martha quest novels its an observation that doesnt apply at all to her latest book alfred amp emily an intriguing work that is half fiction half memoir the sketchy insubstantial first half of the book imagines what her parents lives might have been like if world war i had never occurred the potent and harrowing second half recounts the real life story of her parents and the incalculable ways in which the war fractured their dreams and psyches and left them stranded in the bush in africa eking out a meager existence on a tiny farm in rhodesia

1632950 this sly and discombobulating flight of whimsy by david deans is in a sense a book length joke and nothing drains the humor from a good joke as effectively as vivisecting it has comenius hallucinated his transformation and if so where did he acquire his knowledge of kafka and rilke of orpheus and lady macbeth is bob a good guy after all is he even out of town let alone in mexico and where is miss scarlett anyway mr deans may or may not provide the answers to these queries but the readers irresistible desire to know is evidence that hes pulled off a splendid joke
1632951 despite its specific american flavors travel writing seems most like a contemporary french novel such as those by christian oster and gregoire bouillier a book in which an atmosphere of established and almost enviable dailiness underwrites sophisticated narrative conceits truth matters less than the telling and that makes for a cool easy kind of fiction its not hemingway or borges or even dashiell hammett but its nice
1632952 have i raved enough i feel as if im barrys publicist or agent maybe shell give me a cut of the 2 million but i did love this book it didnt matter if i was in a bad mood or tired or had other things to do i wanted to read this book i wanted to be living in these characters minds hanging out in salem or on yellow dog island does the novel deserve the hype i certainly dont begrudge it
1632953 the now forgotten us immigrants to the soviet union in the early thirties were communist sympathisers or more often desperate victims of the depression at first they were feted waves of repression however ensured that they and their descendants ended up either in russias prisons or as inmates of the gulag this is a powerful important and highly readable book the gulag is no novelty but tzouliadis brilliantly links high politics to the torment of innocents adding devastating detail
1632954 the process of government can be annoying in its obsessive repetition of its main theme in its lack of interest in empirical evidence and yet its one of those rare books which change the way you look at the world
1632955 it would be difficult to find any precedent in american history for the scale brutality and illegality of the torture and degradation inflicted on detainees over the last six years

1632983 he pretended he was a big fan of nuclear power
1632984 i think it was just the labour party plant who was attempting to entrap
1632985 so these labour party members were so clever they were able to evade the tight security they got themselves dressed up they got themselves invitations they got the passes they got delegates credentials they paid the money to go to the conference and they got into the door
1632986 they got up close and personal to national mps at their cocktails and they were able to grill those innocent national mps about their policies and all the while nobody noticed these labour party infiltrators

1633170 and to do this we realize that all these are constitutional issues which require constitutional amendments therefore the nec has approved the recommendation of the nwc that there should be a mini convention of the party where all these amendments shall be ratified
1633171 thats all we have done and if such amendments are ratified it does not mean that there and then on the spot the chairman or any member has been removed but due processes will have to be taken administratively to ensure that the amendment so ratified when it done is carried out under very cool calm and family relationship tendencies that the pdp is known to operate
1633172 should start with a burning map like in the movies fucking flames burning the world away thats the best thing about all those old films
1633173 when you see this old parchment map just getting darker and darker in the center crisping crinkling until suddenly it just fwoom
1633174 it was found very disturbing the irregular promotion of 140 officers prior to the inauguration of the commission without due recourse to the psc that has the statutory responsibility to do so
1633175 the commission notes that the special promotion was not based on the established criteria and was a total breach of section 153 of the 1999 constitution and the psc act 2001 it has therefore been the cause of disillusionment agitation and indiscipline within the nigeria police force
1633176 consequently after due consideration of this avowed commitment to the rule of law and in order to guarantee a level playing field for all members of the police force the commission re examined the guidelines for promotion of all the ranks ranging from deputy inspector general of police to constable thus overturned the aforementioned special promotion of some police officers
1633177 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio worker makes in a year
1633178 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work
1633179 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more
1633180 i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy
1633181 oilman driller he says we cant drill our way out of the problem i think he knows more about it than john mccain
1633182 strongly encouraged by sen obamas speech on americas energy future
1633183 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago

1633191 you see it was the only workers i could get
1633192 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1633193 unique body style that is not based on any existing model the company said
1633194 this will facilitate the capacity of young people from each country to work and holiday in each others countries he said
1633195 im a very firm believer that schemes like this broaden the understanding of each others cultures
1633196 usually when people are taking a holiday to australia they are only given a tourist visa and cannot work he told reporters
1633197 with this agreement our children who are taking a holiday in australia are able to work in all lines of working fields according to the needs there
1633198 there has been no decision by the australian government to have a guest worker scheme with anyone as yet he said
1633199 while you know there is consideration before cabinet about such matters the focus is very much on the south pacific as a trial
1633200 a decision will be taken and announced shortly about that but the focus has always been on both the south pacific and a trial as part of our attempts to stabilise the south pacific economies
1633201 there has not been any formal engagement with indonesia on those issues senator evans said
1633202 cauterise the lower lakes has infuriated some groups who want the federal government to save the lakes instead by buying more water from upstream irrigators
1633203 there is not enough water in the system to bring down the sorts of quantities of water youd need to fill the lower lakes and to handle the evaporation in the lakes and transmission loss senator wong told abc radio
1633204 even if we did make a decision to not give any allocations upstream there is insufficient water currently in storage less the critical human needs issue for us to viably manage the lower lakes with the amount of water that we have
1633205 do we want to build a weir no mr rann said
1633206 penny wong has waved the white flag on the future of the lower lakes he said
1633207 destroying the freshwater ecology of the lower lakes for a generation a half century or perhaps even a century
1633208 if that action is taken it is a very sad day for how australia has mismanaged the murray darling basin he said
1633209 its a profoundly important decision because the advice i have is once the salt waters in there it is next to impossible to get it out
1633210 thats part of a mature responsible relationship with the chinese government
1633211 we will always raise our human right concerns with them
1633212 ive done it in the past ive done it privately ive done it publicly ill be doing it at again
1633213 i think its true to say that in the sweep of time over the last quarter of a century the last 30 years china has made substantial improvements
1633214 not just in human rights but in other areas such as trying to spread the economic benefits but it is the case regrettably that we do continue to have very significant concerns
1633215 i think it is important to make this point the olympic games the olympic spirit is an unambiguously good thing for china
1633216 and one of the reasons we were very strong on both raising our concerns about tibet but at the same time saying we didnt see a boycott of the olympics as being in any way useful was because china hosting the olympics is a very good thing for china
1633217 this has been the iranian strategy for years to bide their time and continue with their enrichment
1633218 you see it was the only workers i could get
1633219 it was the start of a savage hourlong attack by medellin then 18 and five fellow gang members who raped the girls and forced them to perform sex acts before beating then strangling them with a belt and shoelaces it would be four days before their bodies decomposing in the houston heat were found by then medellin already had boasted to friends about having virgins blood on his underpants
1633220 its going to take a little bit of money out of peoples pockets at a time when people are already struggling
1633221 it would act as a tiny brake a further brake on the economy
1633222 in the current business climate raising any taxes is not productive
1633223 i think its a step forward that hes acknowledging we need real revenue to bridge the budget gap
1633224 everybodys struggling and 1 percent on top of the gas prices and all 1 percent isnt so subtle not in these times
1633225 its always easy to pass on the tab to the taxpayers
1633226 we dont need another 1 percent sales tax i guarantee that
1633227 its one more reason for people to drive the extra 30 miles to reno
1633228 while modifications are growing they are not keeping pace with the growing number of defaults and foreclosures
1633229 it wasnt until i was in college that i began dealing with the enormity of what happened and was ready to take on the fight for what was right and just
1633230 my wife carole and i had a 15 minute private meeting with president bush we made a decision that we wanted something to happen
1633231 does it bring us one step closer to what we wanted to accomplish yes do we still want to know all of those who were responsible yes
1633232 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims
1633233 now these victims and their families can get the long overdue justice they deserve
1633234 many positive things have been accomplished since 1988 better air security improvements with first responders and support for other families affected by terrorist acts
1633235 but every day i miss my brother and all the positive things dont change that my children will grow up without an uncle
1633236 were coming up on the 20th anniversary and id like the whole thing to be over
1633237 its been grueling and frustrating but weve survived because we have each other to lean on
1633238 is still on the surface and will be with us the rest of our lives
1633239 have been a trial for us to get justice we dont want revenge we want the facts out we want to know why it happened and mete out punishment
1633240 it cannot be overstated that brandon is a tragically innocent victim
1633241 lindsey came to this neighborhood armed with a deadly weapon and a despicable lack of regard for the consequences of his actions
1633242 he was just riding around it wasnt like he was hiding it
1633243 this could have been avoided if the police had done their job
1633244 my face was pushed into the ground my arm was twisted and i was hit two or three times in the face
1633245 i can still taste it your innocence promise me youll never lose it
1633246 oi kame moshi moshi i can see the lights but home

1633253 i never got to thank you for helping me break out of my shell so im going to thank you now
1633254 i would encourage anyone who feels they have been unfairly treated because of the way an insurance company has calculated the risk factor associated with someones age to then come forward and make use of the system

1633262 execution by shooting wont kill the convicts instantly the law states that if the first shot on the heart doesnt work they must be shot again to the head he said
1633263 the executions are one problem and the decision of the constitutional court is another problem there is no relationship human rights minister andi mattalatta said
1633264 it has nothing to do with the execution process the constitutional challenge they filed wont have any effect on the planned execution he said
1633265 it will only have an effect if the constitutional court issues a decision quickly in their favour
1633266 the report confirms the rudd ggvernments commitment to ensuring payments and working arrangements support families choices ms macklin said

1633268 the market has a september rate cut pretty well priced in
1633269 the risk is that they the reserve bank of australia dont go in september
1633270 the market is probably correcting a little bit from the rapid downdraft
1633271 our sole focus is to make sure we deliver the best possible service to eligible elderly and disabled people to make sure those most in need keep their tv at switchover
1633272 we have to operate the help scheme in a way that is both platform neutral and good value for money to the bbc licence fee payer
1633273 sky was chosen to supply the standard offer in the border region because firstly sky has committed to deliver the high standard of care and service that the help scheme requires for older and disabled eligible people and only then because it represented the best value for money to the help scheme
1633274 its important to note that help scheme eligible people are given a choice of several different ways to go digital including a freeview box delivered for the same cost as the standard offer or other options to convert one tv at slightly higher but still subsidised cost
1633275 we are now delivering the help scheme on the ground in the scottish borders and though it is early days so far we are receiving the expected level of response with no indications of consumers having major issues so that is encouraging
1633276 we are of course keeping a close eye on how our help is being received by eligible people
1633277 we operated a rigorously fair selection weighing sky against other potential suppliers of the standard offer following the process outlined in the scheme agreement between the government and the bbc
1633278 its quite unwarranted to assert that eligible people will be exposed to heavy handed marketing
1633279 we explain their digital choices simply and clearly and tell them at the start they do not have to pay a subscription for the service
1633280 let me say that at the time of the last election i made a mistake in the way the issue was handled
1633281 but can i also say that since the last election water has become the most important issue for australia indeed many parts of the world
1633282 wa unlike other states has the capacity to develop an integrated water supply system to provide water security for this state for another 100 years
1633283 a long term well thought out well costed and considered project
1633284 its time in wa for some genuine big thinking some big thinking some forward thinking because this generation right now is in a unique period of prosperity that weve enjoyed in recent years
1633285 there is a responsibility on this generation to provide for future generations this is the time to do it and water is one of the key issues
1633286 probably been too much too quickly for people to absorb
1633287 in wa we happen to have one of the worlds greatest water resources and we should use that for the state
1633288 in the last 50 years the pilbara has underpinned our development in the mining and resources industries in the next 50 years the kimberley will be just as important

1633295 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games the olympic games represent something powerful that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible however the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur

1633318 one of the sponsors of the oil bunkerers called our commander on phone recently and warned him that they would make life miserable for him in the niger delta for stopping their business
1633319 the man told the commander that he alone has up to 200 barges that is involved in oil business in the creek and that is what he has been doing for survival over the years saying that if the commander continues with his plan to stop them they would make sure he is taken off
1633320 somebody called me and said that i am the cause of the troubles and that he will deal with me
1633321 nothing will make me stop i am here to stop their illegal activities no amount of threat or blackmail by them will deter me
1633322 we are not after his life i dont think he knows the havoc he is causing to the people who live in the area they are doing this bunkering we are after stopping the business and nothing more it cannot thrive as long as i am here

1633352 you cant be scared because an overcard hits the board like that on the river because it wouldnt have made any sense for someone to be holding it at that point
1633353 why would anybody have a 10 in their hand at that point and not have bet it earlier if it were a pair it doesnt fit the equation if it doesnt make sense then you need to maximize value and get a bet out there

1633422 if memory serves me right my room should be three balconies ahead
1633423 sheesh i thought you were the local pervert trying to peep in on unsuspecting girls
1633424 i never thought youd enter our room by balcony ai san
1633425 everyones been acting so weird around me lately its like theyre all falling in love at just the sight of me
1633426 i wanted to see how you were doing thats all
1633427 hey look at what you did ai san got angry
1633428 nothing much just wondering if i could communicate telepathically with sayumi

1633430 so yeah im practically blind right now since i cant seem to find my contacts either
1633431 do you mind if i stay here for a while i need a place to think
1633432 i was going for your cheek but you turned your head

1633443 you try having reina in lingerie seduce you or eri straddling you in bed or meet face to face with devil
1633444 well i wanted to sell love potions so i could be richer so im just testing them on yooou
1633445 because youve got a responsible personality a gorgeous body and youre absolutely sexy when youre submissive
1633446 something in that formula enhances the mutual attraction from the person that looks at you so it doesnt change any ones personalities too much they are still themselves but they fall in love with you under their consciousness instead of going totally out of character
1633447 why should you be thinking about koharu when you should be worrying about me the groping demon of hello project
1633448 come now you know that was just a stunt to get me out
1633449 right now the only one in my sights is you my dear ai chan
1633450 though there are times where i just want to hug you so tight cause youre so cute
1633451 ill hug him and squeeze him and call him george
1633452 i was going for your cheek but you turned your head
1633453 those lusty eyes it feels like they are going to consume me

1633470 i dont think im doing anything different leadoff is a comfortable spot for me a spot ive hit in my whole minor league career and early in my major league career but i felt comfortable hitting third
1633471 i dont buy it that said sometimes a change is good in the order it breaks things up you might have them get a different look how they go into a game
1633472 i was on my last legs in 2008 i was 42 years old and they still couldnt beat me

1633475 i just kept pushing to get to this point three years of rehab has been for this day now its come and gone ive got to kind of refocus and set new goals
1633476 i was good until the fifth inning then i got in trouble with the pitcher
1633477 that was the guy i had to get out because i had two outs i got to 3 1 and hes a good hitter and he hit that double

1633486 the issue of screening for prostate cancer is frankly an area of medicine that remains somewhat unsettled
1633487 while its clear there is benefit to a significant number of men its equally clear that many men end up being diagnosed and treated for cancers that would likely not have caused them any significant harm
1633488 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1633489 no secret deal or accommodation kept us out of the city

1633517 john mccain believes roe v wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench
1633518 i think its entirely appropriate for states to restrict or even prohibit late term abortions as long as there is a strict well defined exception for the health of the mother now i dont think that mental distress qualifies as the health of the mother
1633519 a concrete education and action plan to focus and strengthen the u s feminist movement one that can win survival issues such as 24 hour child care nationalized health care and full reproductive rights

1633521 i was on my last legs in 2008 i was 42 years old and they still couldnt beat me
1633522 thats nothing mad dog i was out of the majors for three years three years but i came back and dominated those guys like nothing happened
1633523 theres always been some doubt with all the health issues ive been through

1633528 if the mjc wants to find sponsorship or joe de francis wants to fund the race that honors his father frank de francis then theyll run we dont have the money to pay magna to keep the barns open and we dont have the money to pay for the stakes purses even with all the cuts well still be from 500 000 to 1million in the red the purse money we have will be used to fund the overnight purses for live racing
1633529 the mjc came to us and said were going to close the barns unless you pay us to keep it open its like someone walking into a bank with a pistol and you give him the key and say here you can have everything thats in the vault there is nothing in the vault
1633530 what are we going to use for money wed have to use purse money and if we did that wed have to cut the purses and no one would run in our races so what good would it do to have stabling with no races
1633531 i dont want to influence the vote of the commission
1633532 but the mjc and magna and the thoroughbred horsemen are doing horribly this is probably something that has to give
1633533 but this could be the death knell people will leave and not come back they can go to pennsylvania and run for bigger purses in easier races its unfortunate for the state
1633534 i have not heard anything about cutting back the dates from the mjc or the horsemen they have to come forward with the date request in november but i do not believe anyone will make a formal presentation until after the nov 4 slots referendum vote
1633535 my hope and desire would be that the referendum passes and the legislature would give us an advance on the revenue to carry us to 2010

1633541 this case highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information
1633542 cases like these send a clear message to those who might be tempted to abuse our computer networks to steal information and harm law abiding people and businesses
1633543 if you do we will track you down wherever you are in the world we will arrest you and we will send you to jail
1633544 people can certainly feel annoyed that in this case tj maxx has not been doing its job in keeping their details safe
1633545 the victims can legitimately ask that their personal information is dealt with in a secure manner when they use their credit cards
1633546 a lot of christians wear crosses around their necks do you think when jesus comes back hes really going to want to see a fucking cross ow maybe thats why he hasnt shown up yet its like going up to jackie onassis wearing a sniper rifle pendant just thinking of john jackie we love him trying to keep that memory alive baby mimes shooting a rifle i did that routine in fyffe alabama and after the show these three rednecks came up to me hey buddy cmere hey mr comedian cmere hey buddy were christians and we dont like what you said i said well then forgive me
1633547 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1633548 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers

1633552 de vlaamse reissector is levendiger dan ooit de vlaamse reisbureaus zijn kmos en die zijn taai en flexibel
1633553 enkele bijkantoren van hoofdkantoren werden gesloten een 70 jarige uitbater stopte er na al die jaren mee en een uitbater van een ander reisbureau stopte ermee omdat hij ook een begrafenisonderneming heeft en de reizen naar het hiernamaals blijkbaar meer opbrengen
1633554 de vlaamse reissector wordt voorlopig niet bedreigd door de hoge brandstofprijzen en de dalende koopkracht enerzijds of de reisboekingen via internet en de grote touroperators anderzijds
1633555 in nederland verdween recentelijk een derde van de bestaande reisbureaus bij onze noorderburen zijn de reisbureaus doorgaans middelgrote bedrijven die werken met redelijk veel personeel en als het economisch minder goed gaat krijgen zij snel klappen
1633556 in vlaanderen hebben we vooral kleine bedrijfjes meestal uitgebaat door een man met zijn echtgenote als het wat minder gaat zijn zij soepeler en kunnen ze spaarzamer hun bedrijf runnen
1633557 we voeren een strenge controle uit voor we een nieuw bureau aanvaarden bij de minste twijfel over een goede solvabiliteit zullen we een nieuweling niet erkennen
1633558 we zijn in ieder geval niet gekomen voor de olympische gedachte
1633559 nederland heeft er goed aan gedaan de competitie uit te stellen
1633560 natuurlijk stond feyenoord ook niet te springen om me vier weken te laten gaan maar ik mis geen offici le wedstrijd hooguit die om de johan cruijff schaal maar dat zou goed nieuws betekenen want in dat geval hebben we de olympische finale gehaald
1633561 maar de scouts hebben hun werk goed gedaan en kennen de kracht van de tegenstander mijn doelstelling is duidelijk ik wil een medaille halen en dan moet je ook deze groep door kunnen komen
1633562 hij is een van de beste spelers ter wereld maar we willen argentini graag vermijden in de kwartfinale
1633563 dit team is niet voor niets twee keer op rij europees kampioen geworden dat zegt genoeg over de potentie van deze groep en over de kwaliteiten van de trainer en zijn staf het is knap dat ze een groep op het juiste moment kunnen laten pieken en dat is in peking weer de bedoeling
1633564 dat vind ik echt vreselijk een paar jaar geleden hoorde de bouwer van het schip ir h w stapel van de rdm al van het plan het schip met de boeg naar de maashaven af te meren
1633565 die gekken willen haar met de kont naar zee leggen dat mag niet hoor riep hij vertoornd tijdens een symposium op de wilhelminapier
1633566 je kunt haar zo niet goed fotograferen zegt een man met camera
1633567 de argumenten voor het met de boeg naar zee afmeren hoor je vooral van mensen van mijn leeftijd en die gevaren hebben zegt de 69 jarige oostrijck
1633568 maar dit schip zal niet meer varen en hoeft dus ook niet meer met de kop richting zee te liggen
1633569 ikzelf had haar graag aan de wilhelminakade zien liggen maar je weet dat dat niet realistisch is zegt oostrijck
1633570 hier op katendrecht is ze goed bereikbaar is er alle ruimte om te parkeren en het is ook goed voor de kaap
1633571 als je komt aanrijden bij het schip rijst die enorme boeg hoog boven de kade uit

1633606 tumour growth and weight fell by between 41 and 53 and while in untreated mice the disease spread rapidly to involve other body parts no such spread was seen in the vitamin c treated animals
1633607 uh huh vitamin c will probably slow cancer just as much as a certain man slowed a tank convoy at tienanmen square
1633608 this is encouraging work but its at a very early stage because it involves cells grown in the lab and mice
1633609 there is currently no evidence from clinical trials in humans that injecting or consuming vitamin c is an effective way to treat cancer
1633610 some research even suggests that high doses of antioxidants can make cancer treatment less effective reducing the benefits of radiotherapy and chemotherapy
1633611 the dose they employed up to four grams per kilo of bodyweight was far greater than any that could be achieved using diet or vitamin pills as the digestive system does not absorb more than a fixed amount taken orally

1633688 support bringing a federal facility to a community in my district that does not welcome it
1633689 i hold the prime minister personally responsible for the damage that is about to be done to the nation and to the integrity and dignity of the malays
1633690 i have thus far constrained my criticism of the prime minister to his failed policies and general incompetence in leading the nation
1633691 but now it is clear that his vendetta against those who would seek his early dismissal from office knows no boundaries and will transgress all limits of the rule of law
1633692 this is a man under siege he sees no way out but to deflect the attention of the malaysian people with a sham trial against me he is now burning the forest to save his own tree
1633693 the real criminals will in their efforts to humiliate me and to derail the peoples aspirations for transformational change in malaysia hide behind a smokescreen created by the government controlled mainstream media
1633694 the evidence proves that the accuser lied in his initial report
1633695 other witnesses in this case have been threatened and harassed in order to fabricate evidence doctors appear to have been pressure to violate all norms of medical ethics
1633696 senior ministers in their comments about the case have demonstrated their consistent interference in the investigation
1633697 whether bail for me tomorrow is denied or not the campaign for permatang pauh will continue my sarong and songkok can even appear on my behalf at the constituency
1633698 manoharan won while he was under detention of course i dont want to pre empt that
1633699 until today ive not seen the police report dated june 28 by accuser saiful and the medical report where is sanity and rule of law
1633700 if anwar is denied bail the very morality and legitimacy of the abdullah premiership will come under question nationally and internationally
1633701 are we a nation which deserves international trust and respect for our high and unquestioned regard for the rule of law and a judiciary of independence impartiality integrity and meritocracy
1633702 this is to ensure that nobody will abuse their position and government machinery during the umno elections it is up to the aca whether to take any action
1633703 it is not only umno members who want a fair election but also malaysians and especially the malay community want the same thing
1633704 i can only say that my report is against the powers that be who are the most powerful people in this country
1633705 probably the worst thing ive seen in 20 years of policing
1633706 there are a number of points of protection and they all failed for katelynn child welfare has whats thought to be a pretty strict screening process
1633707 we are particularly concerned that native child and family services had something to do with the placement of katelynn with donna irving
1633708 that i may publish with the voice of thanksgiving and tell of all thy wondrous works
1633709 by the time you read this i will be dead
1633710 ive already killed kim put the dogs out back to give them a fighting chance and killed myself how could i tell kim she is about to be homeless how
1633711 we saw that there was a need that was expressed by parents in our district
1633712 we did a lot of research and now were opening a brand new school with close to 600 students
1633713 the computer image is projected onto a screen the students can go up to the screen and touch it its almost like the iphone
1633714 i truly believe smart boards can be used in every single classroom subject
1633715 almost any subject you can think of can be enhanced through the power of the interactive white board
1633716 i can put a picture or a video of something that is going on in our class on the site and after kids can plug a microphone into the computer and add comments or thoughts verbally
1633717 its kind of like graffiti or message board its one way that i can assess kids who have trouble learning in the written form
1633718 its made things way too easy for assignments its too cosmetic and too easy
1633719 to me the computer is just a very big fancy filing cabinet i think we need to slow this baby down its a two dimensional space on a computer but we live in a three dimensional world
1633720 were not going to be only about technology were going to infuse it into the curriculum
1633721 our kids are in the digital age so now we are enhancing our curriculum through the infusion of technology its an added resource
1633722 both companies have stated that the current economic climate is affecting marketing budgets in all industries and that market conditions had changed during the course of the agreements
1633723 we are currently out in the marketplace proactively contacting potential sponsors through our sponsorship agency img we remain optimistic that we will find new sponsors for the world championship and the masters
1633724 the scottish fa is at the heart of the game here in scotland every year we invest millions of pounds in scotlands clubs players and coaches thanks to this new deal we will be able to take this investment to a new level and to make sure that more people than ever before have the chance to play football
1633725 now is the time for a real debate on the future of public sector sports broadcasting which i know is under consideration and under review
1633726 all these people interested in cricket buy television licences and surely they should have a right to expect that the public sector broadcasters mount bids for the nations summer sport if the bbc is to remain part of this it must answer to the millions of cricket fans in england and wales how it prioritises its investment in sports rights
1633727 we are astonished by these comments from the ecb we have always said that any bid for live test cricket would be subject to value for money and being able to fit into the scheduling in our view neither of these criteria were met we have consistently argued that not having cricket as a listed event puts it out of the reach of all terrestrial broadcasters it is absurd to blame the bbc for this outcome
1633728 by far the largest prostitution investigation in the history of the state of arizona
1633729 these girls range from middle class to your upper class neighborhoods
1633730 illegal immigration is fueling arizonas violent crime and drug problem
1633731 most people really dont know much about the county attorney they dont really know very often who he or she should be
1633732 in this case youve got andrew thomas whos very controversial hes in the press a lot its way too early to say a democrat couldnt beat him but its going to be a pretty uphill challenge
1633733 i want the best training for attorneys in the state in four years and the best training in the nation at eight
1633734 thomas has diverted funds intended for crime fighting and put them into ad campaigns that promote himself
1633735 he has rewarded the lawyers who contributed to his last campaign with tens of millions of dollars in public contacts paid for with our tax dollars
1633736 four years ago i ran on a platform of stopping illegal immigration
1633737 i even put it on the slogan on my signs before that unorthodox move quite a few elites snickered at my campaign approach
1633738 i think its fair to say to those who asked what a county attorney can do about illegal immigration four years ago i at least now have answered that question i have fulfilled my promise to deal with the voters in that regard in a major way
1633739 somebody has to speak up and thats what i did in the prop 100 controversy i have no regrets about doing that
1633740 to the extent that inappropriate overheated rhetoric engulfs this issue thats very regrettable and i dont want to be a part of it
1633741 it is a very difficult issue it has been decades in the making we are only now seeing reforms designed to deal with it i want to continue to press for reforms in the right way consistent with the constitution but also showing proper respect for the will of the people
1633742 when you call people to talk theyre afraid to engage you in a rational discussion
1633743 everything is policy driven and they have to check the book before they can talk to you lots of times theyll say if anyone asks ill deny saying this to you but and then theyll have the conversation with you
1633744 the current county attorney has abused his powers in ways that have made us all less safe
1633745 i will restore public confidence in our law enforcement and in our judiciary by reaching out to communities around maricopa county to repair the lost trust actively seek their input and ensure that law enforcement is responsive aggressive and truly colorblind
1633746 best doctors for when you are looking for does not exist anymore
1633747 im still viewed in a certain light and that depiction of me for a very small period of my life is going to follow me for a lot longer than i ever wanted it to
1633748 i have worked tirelessly to rid my community of that behaviour and so it was a shock they could come into my home believing they would find weapons
1633749 you cant just get a phone call about somebody and go and kick in their door
1633750 that was discussed very carefully at the board as it was making its decision
1633751 to have that space there to be able to draw youth from all those communities will have a fairly significant impact on the scarborough community as a whole
1633752 to lower trade barriers decrease trade distorting subsidies and stabilize an affordable food supply for all nations
1633753 reasonable reforms to our crop insurance program and our system of countercyclical and direct aid payments
1633754 marketing tools for the fruit and vegetable industries the farm bill though he said he favored tighter payment limits and a ban on ownership of livestock by meatpackers
1633755 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1633756 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1633757 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1633758 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1633759 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1633760 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1633761 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1633762 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1633763 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1633764 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1633765 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation
1633766 i have no idea why john mccain doesnt support it it hurts him in indiana and missouri and ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear
1633767 iowa minnesota wisconsin and perhaps indiana are very important states mccain is behind and hes in danger of falling further behind
1633768 in other words throw it out and start over again
1633769 im still viewed in a certain light and that depiction of me for a very small period of my life is going to follow me for a lot longer than i ever wanted it to
1633770 i have worked tirelessly to rid my community of that behaviour and so it was a shock they could come into my home believing they would find weapons
1633771 you cant just get a phone call about somebody and go and kick in their door
1633772 that was discussed very carefully at the board as it was making its decision
1633773 to have that space there to be able to draw youth from all those communities will have a fairly significant impact on the scarborough community as a whole
1633774 what we have demonstrated is prudence and the ability to adjust to changing circumstances as they arise
1633775 we continue to be concerned about signs of short term thinking on the part of the government in particular the year end spending spree and the decisions to spend some of the crown share rather than putting it on the debt
1633776 i dont think that that gives us a great sense of stability and confidence in the future when the government boasts of large surpluses based on one time payments
1633777 my links are all telling me theres going to be an announcement that the ville de quebec will be taken from natos standing maritime group and sent to waters off somalia to escort world food programme relief supplies to somalia
1633778 any confirmation would have to come from the government concerned
1633779 if a naval escort is provided by any country we would of course welcome it wholeheartedly
1633780 then we had a danish frigate then we had a dutch frigate which escorted ships sailing mostly from mombasa to mogadishu they escorted i think a total of something like 27 ships with enough food to feed a million people for six months
1633781 we have been appealing for anyone to step forward to protect ships carrying wfp food into somalia especially now because in the coming months we need to double the tonnages that we bring into somalia because the needs have gone up basically we aim to feed 2 4 million people by december
1633782 it was a relatively small ship we need a continuous supply line of large ships to meet the need in somalia
1633783 thats why its vital to have escorts because if there are one or two attacks on these unescorted ships we could well see that all ship owners say no its not worth the risk we are not willing to go and then the sea lifeline to somalia will be cut completely
1633784 it is extremely worrying particularly because of the increased violence in somalia kidnappings attacks on somali ngo workers in recent weeks plus the violence between the various warring parties
1633785 if we were unable to deliver sufficient food assistance in the coming months we could see a situation similar to the 1992 1993 famine in which hundreds of thousands of people perished
1633786 there is no somali navy as has been eminently demonstrated so theres every cause for the international community to respond to both somalia and the world food programmes request for escorting
1633787 and then the ship itself has got not only its main armament but its got a boarding party that would be incredibly powerful in dealing with the pirate vessels
1633788 i was like oh my god hes going to hit this guy
1633789 i didnt think the guy was alive at first but then i could hear a gurgling
1633790 i moved him maybe a couple of feet and he started moaning so i stopped
1633791 i look up and the truck is there and basically it missed his head by a foot and the gust of wind knocked me on my ass
1633792 this 29 year old guy would be dead now if it werent for him he could have got killed doing what he was trying to do
1633793 if i were to run in kulim bandar baharu they would say i wanted my wife and daughter with me in parliament
1633794 now that i am running in permatang pauh they say wan azizah has cheated and wronged the people why dont they let the voters decide what is right or wrong
1633795 they asked me go to the hospital why im not sick but if i dont go they say i am not cooperating they asked me to strip if i refuse i am wrong they asked me to fill in a rape victims form as well
1633796 finally when i refused to have a picture of me taken naked they say anwar is not cooperative
1633797 why did they have to bring such a big team just one corporal wouldve sufficed
1633798 im not surprised but if they want to do it bring it down to rm2
1633799 hadi assured me that pas were committed to pakatan rakyat
1633800 this is to ensure that nobody will abuse their position and government machinery during the umno elections it is up to the aca whether to take any action
1633801 it is not only umno members who want a fair election but also malaysians and especially the malay community want the same thing
1633802 i can only say that my report is against the powers that be who are the most powerful people in this country
1633803 it is not only umno members who want a fair election but also malaysians
1633804 we admit that money politics exists in the division but we have yet to take any action we will bring up the case to the umno secretariat for further action
1633805 all these are like cancer which could destroy umno we are fighting each other by using not only money politics but also outside influence and threats
1633806 hurling abuses and inviting outsiders to hurl abuses also are not right never have i seen things like these before
1633807 police had carried out an investigation on a sexual crime involving intercourse against the order of nature involving anwar based on existing legal principles and procedures
1633808 the investigation papers had been handed over to the office for advice and a decision
1633809 pkr youth believes this action is reprehensible and cruel to prevent anwar from campaigning actively and contesting in the by election and we do not rule out political interference to prevent t anwar from getting to putrajaya
1633810 wed look far more favorably at an urgent care clinic that was accredited than one that wasnt
1633811 it means an organization is taking a hard look at a variety of safety issues that should be involved in caring for someone who is acutely ill
1633812 if it is a good high quality urgent care center that can keep someone out of the emergency department who doesnt need to be there that is a good thing
1633813 one of our concerns that people cant recognize when they have an emergency or dont
1633814 a patient who says they are having indigestion and goes to an urgent care clinic may really be having a heart attack
1633815 we dont encourage patients with chest pain to go to urgent care centers but the reality is that we need to be prepared for anything that walks through our doors
1633816 research a facility first to be sure they are going to be seen by a physician and that the facility will be able to provide all of the necessary services that might be required
1633817 made a good faith effort to conduct the graduation ceremony to best accommodate the participants and their invited guests
1633818 it just means we have to sweep our sidewalk every other day
1633819 im hoping once they build the town hall they will have people in there and my business will increase
1633820 most people only have a half hour or hour for lunch so theyre not going to drive far
1633821 a lot of old buckeye folks are excited about the new construction
1633822 theres some developers looking around and saying this is positive
1633823 the more businesses we can get the better off well be
1633824 we left it up to them and followed their lead on how to deal with the situation
1633825 realized she was not helping her kids she was only hurting their future
1633826 weve budgeted appropriately so it wont affect customers or services
1633827 most are concerned about their neighborhood park making them safe renovated
1633828 a lot of folks want shade they want more trees artificial shade ramadas and shade structures over the playground they want shade in all the seating areas
1633829 we need new roofs or to demolish and rebuild even our golf courses need infrastructure new irrigation systems
1633830 we need to be much more accessible were going to be out of your way very soon
1633831 its the nations largest most complex light rail starter line ever built
1633832 and the security rushed him again thats when aguilar picked him up and threw him on his back
1633833 the sports event management conference and sports security summit provide an excellent forum for sharing information and ideas with the leading sports event professionals from around the world with the ever changing dynamics and challenges facing the security and crowd management sector we once again look forward to participating in this years conferences and in the years to come
1633834 the courts decision validates the arguments made by apollo group since the beginning of this case namely that the ultimate disclosure of the initial reports contents caused no significant movement in apollos stock price
1633835 obviously this thing aint over till its over but apollo seems to have won a battle today
1633836 systematically engages in actions designed to mislead the department of education and to evade detection of its improper incentive compensation for those involved in recruiting activities

1633847 it is just turning this into a sci fi convention
1633848 its wonderful but a slightly easier life wouldnt be bad you have got to have a life as well
1633849 i couldnt say what it will be that i will be doing but it will be more adult drama i have three ideas and one day i will just pick one of them i am very lucky absolutely
1633850 you cant keep relying on your laurels you have to keep pushing it
1633851 there are all these sorts of ideas running around in my head funnily enough i have a book coming out about it i emailed a journalist every night telling him what happened that day to try and find the shape of my brain i guess i am quite interested in that myself
1633852 some companies have tried and its the same problem the music industry is going through now
1633853 we are heading towards a pattern where television shows are released worldwide to try and combat that problem
1633854 at the same time though i dont want to be critical of the internet a lot of people download
1633855 its an issue of quality but its something we have to keep and eye on
1633856 no i dont have any control over that sort of thing i just hope they heed our wise words and act on it
1633857 the situation at the moment in the opinion polls is that we are not doing very well to say the least
1633858 every by election that we face this sort of thing is going to be said like with crewe it was said that if we lost gordon would have to go it is all nonsense
1633859 we are mid term of a third term in office and inevitably people are going to express their views on different issues in by elections and local government elections
1633860 the issues at the moment are what you might call the bread and butter ones in terms of family finances the price of food and petrol and all the rest of it
1633861 people are feeling the pinch they are feeling the cost of living go up because of global circumstances mainly but inevitably they will take it out on the government
1633862 there is also the enormous volatility of the british public these days only a year ago the ratings for gordon brown were very high and although they have come down it does fluctuate enormously and we have got two years to the next election and things can change i have seen it a lot in my time in politics
1633863 inevitably we have to explain to people what is happening in terms of the economy and the way we react to that

1633887 i think creatively what russells achieved across those three shows is a coherence actually
1633888 its not something were going to start doing every week
1633889 the first reaction i think was that its a sign of failure from 13 episodes to five that doesnt have to be the case torchwood did brilliant business in the uk
1633890 no use pretending its not art house its not even authored in a way its a big massive brand a bbc brand the most important show everyones hard on everyone and im part of that process too we dont all wear slippers and velvet jackets and have chats over sherry

1633927 it was a silly jump something that could have been like two stories high
1633928 ive been married for 15 years and i have three kids so im extremely grateful on their account
1633929 in the time ive been here ive done just about every case ive been trained for
1633930 it is an excellent surgery you have to remember that the people who are this overweight basically have their metabolism go to zero really the gratitude you get from helping someone in that situation is overwhelming
1633931 the patients response is more than its ever been with any other surgery ive performed
1633932 it is the type of surgery that has guaranteed results
1633933 it is a bit of an emotional roller coaster because you cant do what you did before but dr fath is a great doctor
1633934 he doesnt seem to be the typical doctor he is more personable i put my faith in him and he did a good job
1633935 fath has a different bedside manner he makes a big commitment to his patients after the surgery
1633936 i was impressed that he gave me his cell phone after the surgery and told me that i could call him if i had any questions he knows that this surgery is not easy
1633937 i was in pain all over my body going in and out of the hospital for different things
1633938 one day i woke up and i was completely numb from the waist down
1633939 dr fath is just the greatest he is very relaxed and laid back and he doesnt have the i dont care attitude that other doctors have for those of us who have had him as patients he couldnt come back soon enough
1633940 i am convinced that he is the type of person who doesnt do this procedure for self gratification and money he believes and invests time in his patients because he truly wants us to change our lifestyles
1633941 he told me that the stenosis in my neck was mild to moderate not so bad
1633942 both that and the pain i was feeling in my lower back were because i was so overweight
1633943 it think this was one of the toughest years of his life it makes all of us feel so happy to get him back and making a difference in other peoples lives hes our man
1633944 i think we his patients are all connected to him when you feel like you dont have a life anymore and someone comes and gives you that life back there is just a connection there
1633945 online reviews blogs and other sources of online customer feedback before purchasing more importantly

1633966 whilst spouses may have the skills experience of qualifications to make the most appropriate candidate for work in their parents parliamentary or constituency office this is less likely to apply to mps children whether under 18 or young adults
1633967 furthermore recent incidents involving the employment of mps of their children demonstrate clearly the negative impact this has on public confidence in members
1633968 the proposal is therefore that mps children should no longer be able to gain paid employment in their parents constituency or parliamentary offices or in any other role relating to the parents role as an mp
1633969 good regulation should drive competition and boost our productivity but too many new rules can stifle enterprise and blunt our competitive edge
1633970 if the uk is to remain a respected place to do business we must not expect business simply to absorb the costs of a stream of new government initiatives
1633971 the introduction of a regulatory budget for every department will focus new regulations on the real priorities and act as a powerful incentive for departments to cut or streamline existing burdens

1633976 since 2001 al qaeda has conducted a greater number of attacks across a larger geographic area than at any time in its history
1633977 we find it hard to agree that al qaeda has been significantly weakened since sept 11 2001
1633978 working with al qaeda the taliban have steadily tightened their grip over much of the tribal areas in the last several years by cowing or killing hundreds of local tribal chiefs who were the areas traditional authorities
1633979 they consistently said that it was the stores policy and that other customers felt offended by it
1633980 it seemed as if i had been stealing or something so i was very humiliated
1633981 they were actually pushing her into it i became upset at that point
1633982 my heart goes out to her its the most humiliating thing she could have possibly been subjected to whenever a woman is told breastfeeding is offensive or indiscreet its shaming new mothers for doing whats right
1633983 shes responding as a mother should do to her babys every wish to be walked or told to go into a cupboard or a room out of sight would make her feel as though shes done something criminally wrong

1634063 let us cut through the cant of our political class amarnath has become a serious communal issue in an interview given to a hindi daily
1634064 whether we like it or not amarnath has deepened the hindu muslim divide in many respects
1634065 it has exposed the fact that possibilities for intercommunity reconciliation are thinning daily and revealed how every political party has huge investments in a politics of divisiveness that none is likely to divest
1634066 it has brought out the ways in which the congresss myopia and lack of initiative set the stage for a communal politics and it has revealed the dirty secret of all us constitutional secularists we are more interested in having somebody to beat upon than in creating the conditions for peace as with ayodhya the inability to find small compromises articulate meaningful gestures of reconciliation might haunt us for ever

1634117 several outstanding problems in the relationship between the us and pakistan including
1634118 india and afghanistan are likely to be engaged in defence co operation and small development projects and help in local self governance
1634119 not only pakistan even the us will have anxiety on the issue the us would like india and afghanistans co operation up to a point to push pakistan to deliver
1634120 as india cannot object to pakistans relation with say bangladesh pakistan should not have any grouses when india helps afghanistan you must remember that india built roads on its western border only because pakistan steadfastly refuses access to india from the eastern side
1634121 the war in afghanistan is part of pakistans larger struggle with india afghanistan has been a prize that pakistan and india have fought over directly and indirectly for decades to pakistan afghanistan represents a strategic rare base that would along with the islamic nations of ex soviet central asia offer a united front against hindu dominated india and block its rivals access to energy rich regions conversely for india a friendly afghanistan would pressure pakistan on its western border just as india itself pressures pakistan on its eastern border thus dealing pakistan a strategic defeat
1634122 the karzai government has openly and brazenly strengthened its ties with india and allowed indian consulates in jalalabad kandahar herat and mazar e sharif it has kept alive the possibility of inviting india to help train the new afghan army and to help in dam construction in the northeastern afghan province of kunar abutting pakistan all this has driven the isi wild with fear and anger
1634123 one thing we never understood is that india has always been the major threat for pakistan
1634124 we are unlike european donors we are picking up only those project afghan people want us to do we are not imposing our idea of development
1634125 in my life i have seen everything there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his evildoing
1634126 there is a vanity absurdity that takes place on earth that there are more righteous people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked and there are wicked people to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous i said this also is vanity and i commend joy for man has no good thing under the sun but to eat and drink and be joyful for this will go with him in his toil through the days of his life that god has given him under the sun
1634127 if you will seek god and plead with the almighty for mercy if you are pure and upright surely then he will rouse himself for you and restore your rightful habitation
1634128 why do the wicked live reach old age and grow mighty in power

1634131 we wanted to know when our american friends would get interested in tracking down the terrorists responsible for hundreds of suicide bombings in pakistan and those playing havoc with our natural resources in balochistan while sitting in kabul and delhi

1634133 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan

1634139 mato oput involves the man or woman accepting responsibility for their actions and repenting for their crimes against their brothers and sisters

1634143 the taliban are now mounting a hit and run war against their enemies
1634144 it doesnt need much money or weapons compared to what the foreign troops are spending
1634145 the increasing use of very public attacks has had a striking effect on morale far beyond the immediate victims
1634146 gt every time something bad happens anti pakistan elements come out of the woodwork here is a response to the talking heads

1634152 and they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all as any had need
1634153 there was not a needy person among them for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold 35 and laid it at the apostles feet and it was distributed to each as any had need
1634154 contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality
1634155 your abundance at the present time should supply their need so that their abundance may supply your need that there may be fairness
1634156 let the thief no longer steal but rather let him labor doing honest work with his own hands so that he may have something to share with anyone in need
1634157 but if anyone has the worlds goods and sees his brother in need yet closes his heart against him how does gods love abide in him
1634158 afghanistan has been a prize that pakistan and india have fought over directly and indirectly for decades
1634159 to pakistan afghanistan represents a strategic rear base that would along with the islamic nations of ex soviet central asia offer a united front against hindu dominated india and block its rivals access to energy rich regions conversely for india a friendly afghanistan would pressure pakistan on its western border just as india itself pressures pakistan on its eastern border thus dealing pakistan a strategic defeat
1634160 unless we address whats angering the isi we wont be able to stabilize afghanistan or capture al qaeda leaders inside its borders
1634161 only it didnt the links were loosened but they remain for the simple reason these militants are viewed as vital pawns in a bigger game keeping afghanistan unsettled to limit the united statess and by extension arch rival indias influence in the region
1634162 this is a military doctrine about national survival not an ideology of religious fanaticism civilians are not welcome to meddle with it

1634167 strong evidence and circumstantial evidence of american acquiescence to terrorism inside pakistan

1634169 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
1634170 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
1634171 pakistans enemy number one and the mastermind of almost every suicide operation against the pakistan army and the isi since june 2006

1634190 i doctor martin luther wish all lovers of the unshackled art of music grace and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ i truly desire that all christians would love and regard as worthy the lovely gift of music which is a precious worthy and costly treasure given to mankind by god the riches of music are so excellent and so precious that words fail me whenever i attempt to discuss and describe them in summa next to the word of god the noble art of music is the greatest treasure in the world it controls our thoughts minds hearts and spirits our dear fathers and prophets did not desire without reason that music be always used in the churches this precious gift has been given to man alone that he might thereby remind himself that god has created man for the express purpose of praising and extolling god however when mans natural musical ability is whetted and polished to the extent that it becomes an art then do we note with great surprise the great and perfect wisdom of god in music which is after all his product and his gift we marvel when we hear music in which one voice sings a simple melody while three four or five other voices play and trip lustily around the voice that sings its simple melody and adorn this simple melody wonderfully with artistic musical effects thus reminding us of a heavenly dance where all meet in a spirit of friendliness caress and embrace a person who gives this some thought and yet does not regard music as a marvelous creation of god must be a clodhopper indeed and does not deserve to be called a human being he should be permitted to hear nothing but the braying of asses and the grunting of hogs

1634206 researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
1634207 the researchers traced ascorbates anti cancer effect to the formation of hydrogen peroxide in the extracellular fluid surrounding the tumors normal cells were unaffected
1634208 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example two oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range

1634217 while the psa tests are effective for detecting disease the task force found that there is insufficient evidence that they improve long term health outcomes
1634218 during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding
1634219 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal

1634228 from what we can see mainstream pricing is not working too well for hd dvd so far
1634229 it still comes down to content availability and content pricing you cant have cheap players without cheap content
1634230 the definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result
1634231 we cant become what we need by remaining what we are
1634232 a graveyard memorial was something that you looked at but with the berlin piece youre amongst it
1634233 its an attempt to convey a feeling of the horror that is being commemorated you do feel cool and you do feel distant and you feel almost a weight above you thats about trying to convey the experience or some sense of the experience of the event or some sort of sense of disorientation which is as physical as it is intelligent
1634234 each stele slab has an individual marking reminiscent of new zealand which tells you about the flora fauna and history
1634235 therefore its an extremely dense memorial and its extremely exciting
1634236 i dont find it very special its quite ordinary some of us on the jury wanted anish kapoor who put forward a wonderful design rising out of the serpentine lake with seats either side like an amphitheatre so people could sit down and contemplate
1634237 we had to think hard about what diana was like and who she was and what she meant to people in the end we thought anishs proposal caught the spirit of dianas character and that it would excite people they would travel from all over to visit it
1634238 you cant go through the main street of the capital of the most powerful country on earth without seeing it
1634239 its like a trench in the landscape and you cant help but realise the enormity of this trench and the wall of names and thats what has the effect its very effective because its so simple
1634240 i dont think showing off in a memorial is an appropriate thing to do at all and thats why the vietnam one in washington works so well its utterly minimal
1634241 its very moving because its so simple and monumental and definitive its lodged itself in everyones mind unlike the more recent one to the women of world war ii
1634242 i cant get why that was considered a good way to memorialise the women of wwii to have empty coats
1634243 it doesnt say anything about their contribution and it rather underplays their role its very puzzling and quite annoying
1634244 its quite staggering and moving it starts off with a series of empty chairs around an empty round table and then you walk in a line through a park towards a kind of gate
1634245 its got embracing figures curved into the stone and then you walk quite a way right through the town in a straight line and gradually you come to this thing up ahead of you which is this incredible column climbing into the sky
1634246 its very isolated so in that respect its very alone but the fact its shooting upwards its not too melancholy theres some sort of hope there especially for people who are religious

1634249 those athletes regret that action and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf they now realize and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation and by the organizing committee
1634250 i understand that about 200 of our athletes received those masks through the national governing body not directly from the u s olympic committee
1634251 i suspect it was their choice you would have to talk to them as to what prompted them to do this
1634252 i will say this i am not a scientist but in my view that was unnecessary
1634253 i dont believe there was any statement trying to be made
1634254 i would not carry a mask i do not see a need for that this is not a measure i would recommend unless you have a particular disorder
1634255 i would not say that those people should not carry protection devices if they so feel but i honestly doubt about the efficiency unless they are carrying a new generation of masks i dont know

1634262 safe efficient inexpensive and obviously a vital ingredient in the future of the economy of our nation and in our mission to eliminate over time our dependence on foreign oil
1634263 if we really want to enable new technologies tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1634264 nuclear power represents more than 70 percent of our noncarbon generated electricity it is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option however before an expansion of nuclear power is considered obama thinks key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
1634265 and what weve got to figure out is can we store the material properly can we make sure that theyre secure can we deal with the expense
1634266 this is really a surprise because i didnt think it was going to be such a big deal
1634267 why we wore the masks is simple pollution when you train your whole life for something dot all your is and cross all your ts why wouldnt you be better safe than sorry
1634268 they have pollution in los angeles and if the olympics were in los angeles we would probably wear these masks too
1634269 they told us that the chinese were mad and that this is a politically charged issue but we didnt mean to offend anybody
1634270 when they handed us these masks they never said here they are but dont wear them
1634271 its disappointing because i was under the assumption that the mask was approved for use because it was issued by the usoc
1634272 weve said all along that it is the athletes choice whether to wear one if they feel its necessary
1634273 im no scientific expert but walking through an airport doesnt seem like the place where it would be necessary to wear them
1634274 this time i dont think he will have time to have a suit made
1634275 if he does order a suit theyll tell us at the last minute they always keep these things quiet

1634280 a border dispute should not turn the two countries into enemies in all domains
1634281 they were very eager to take the right action which was to apologize to their hosts
1634282 they have the right to wear masks if they feel its in their best interest to do so
1634283 hopefully they wont have to use them and the air quality will be good
1634284 you never want to go to somebody elses place and cause any embarrassment and in this case some of them did
1634285 were not chastising anybody they came forward of their own volition
1634286 it probably wasnt the most opportune time for these athletes to wear these masks
1634287 they were overly cautious those athletes have written an apology to bocog
1634288 we believe hopefully this will be the last incident of this kind

1634312 there is not a single sign of an unmanageable flood of traffic if anything a slowdown is visible more than a speedup this suggests that the industry might benefit from shifting its emphasis towards methods of stimulating traffic growth
1634313 now annual traffic growth rates of 50 percent when combined with cost declines on the order of 33 percent result in no net increase in costs to provide the increased transmission capacity
1634314 in a competitive environment that means no increase in revenues which is hardly a cheering prospect for the industry if traffic growth could be pushed back towards 100 percent where it used to be for many years we would have pressure for increased revenues and also for new technologies

1634396 as a trade union balpa has quite rightly fought long and hard to protect the final salary pensions of its pilot members in british airways and other airlines
1634397 the pilots trade union is now seeking to close its own final salary pension to new entrants and to impose drastic changes to pension benefits for existing staff
1634398 there is no economic justification for these changes because balpa is one of the most successful and financially robust trade unions in the uk
1634399 no employer let alone a trade union should impose changes to terms and conditions of employment without the agreement of its own staff
1634400 we have fought an action against many employers but the reality is that the vast majority of employers dont actually offer a final salary pension scheme to new entrants
1634401 way i see it you can keep working here and break even but i dont see the point
1634402 the main cause has been the influx of asian made or chinese boards into the uk
1634403 the danger is if this continues at the current rate the industry is going to die
1634404 i am also convinced of the need for the scottish government to make its own case on regulations affecting scotland directly to the eu rather than relying on westminster departments

1634406 red tape is a very real problem for firms and one of the most significant avoidable constraints on competitiveness and business growth
1634407 the finance secretarys announcement is most welcome reflects much of what cbi scotland wanted to hear and is a testament to government and business working together

1634409 this is a international olympic committee ioc guideline under rule 51 of the charter which states that flags which can be interpreted as a political gesture are not allowed inside any olympic venues
1634410 and as such only flags which participate in the olympic games are allowed by the ioc
1634411 the minister for heritage believes that welsh athletes should be able to fly the welsh flag on a lap of honour if they wish
1634412 this has serious implications for freedom of expression and the rights of supporters and athletes to celebrate their success
1634413 welsh medal winning athletes and their supporters have been able to wave the welsh flag at previous olympics without the threat of having them confiscated
1634414 for as long as i can remember supporters of welsh athletes have waved the welsh flag at the olympic games
1634415 along with the union flag it is an important symbol to demonstrate their pride in wales role in the british team
1634416 it concerns me that this issue has not been dealt with adequately in the years running up to the beijing games by either the ioc or the games organisers
1634417 the olympic games is about celebrating pride in national achievement and must not be allowed to become an event which seeks to suppress it

1634436 the risk is that they the reserve bank of australia dont go in september
1634437 the market is probably correcting a little bit from the rapid down draft
1634438 the prospect of a cycle of interest rate cuts going forward has really propelled the market on quite well
1634439 the turn comes later and closer to the end of the cutting cycle
1634440 historically the trigger point is earnings revisions beginning once the cycle becomes more positive
1634441 there is no immediate prospect of an improvement in the highly challenging industry conditions that pacifica is currently experiencing it said
1634442 consequently pacifica expects to report a further operating loss in the second half of 2008
1634443 there is also no short term expectation of an increase in locally manufactured large passenger car volumes in australia pacifica said
1634444 in response to the lasting shift in demand towards smaller more fuel efficient cars in the automotive industry pacifica continues to actively pursue initiatives that further improve its capacity utilisation
1634445 approximately 29 million of the sales decline was attributable to the adverse translation effect of a stronger australian dollar with the balance reflecting reduced underlying light truck volumes as consumers responded to the steep rise in petrol prices the company said
1634446 the majority of the sales decrease impacted the knoxville plant where first half volume reductions were exacerbated by the effect of the strike activity at american axle which caused significant disruption to the truck production of pacificas major end customer general motors
1634447 the asian business remains profitable but lower export volumes to north america have served to reduce earnings pacifica said
1634448 considerable effort is being applied to attracting increased custom from the local market to lift the capacity utilisation of the foundry operation at dalian in china
1634449 increased demand associated with supply to the successful export programs of both gm holden and toyota has offset the continuing decline of large passenger car volumes in the local market the company said

1634473 dies bedeutet dass der diskussions und entscheidungsprozess im plenum deutlich breiter werden ferner m ssen alle aufsichtsratsmitglieder die daf r erforderliche qualifikation insbesondere personalkompetenz abbilden und sich nicht zuletzt auch auf mehr zeitliche verf gbarkeit einrichten
1634474 der nominierungsausschuss ist ein geeignetes instrument um die professionalisierung der aufsichtsratsausschussarbeit weiter voranzutreiben dies gilt insbesondere f r die gro en aufsichtsr te der dax 30 unternehmen aber der erfolgsdruck auf die nominierungsaussch sse ist hoch haben sie bei ihren wahlvorschl gen an die hauptversammlung keine gl ckliche hand setzen sich die m ngel kaskadenf rmig in allen aussch ssen fort zu ber cksichtigen ist auch dass der markt f r solche spitzenpers nlichkeiten recht klein und deren zeitliche verf gbarkeit knapp ist die komplexit t der aufgaben l sst die weitere etablierung von mehr berufsaufsichtsr ten unerl sslich erscheinen

1634481 dies hat viele gewerbetreibenden dazu ermutigt nach einer anmeldung ihrer gewerblich genutzten computer bei der gez gegen die geb hrenbescheide den rechtsweg zu beschreiten mittlerweile liegen zwei erstinstanzliche urteile vor die den gewerbetreibenden in unterschiedlichen konstellationen recht geben

1634519 you need money you feel desperate youre scared and there are lots of people who know that and try to take advantage
1634520 if i charged a 3 000 balance transfer then went and charged another 500 i cannot pay the 500 off and thats going to be charged at the higher interest rate so if i send them a 300 minimum payment theyre going to apply that payment toward lowest interest first then ive got 2 700 at the 1 9 percent but now ive also got 500 at the 9 9 or 18 9 or 21 9 percent that i cant pay off until i pay off that teaser rate
1634521 for example you may be able to consolidate 2 000 of your high interest rate credit card debt
1634522 then you take that and you play it against one of your other high interest rate credit cards and work on getting the interest down that way
1634523 its really about behavior modification and the only way to pay down debt is with income and by cutting your spending
1634524 borrowing money from friends and family is very risky but you can also make it worth their while i had three conditions when i borrowed money from my father in law
1634525 family and friends must be your top priority pay them back first never late
1634526 if you get into one of those options and you havent changed the way you think about money you havent changed your spending habits you risk getting into a worse situation than you were in before
1634527 because they charge so much in interest most people end up owing more money because of all the fees
1634528 they hope that by shooting loyalists in the security forces theyll cause ian paisley to have another brainstorm and start another harold wilson but give the loyalists an ultimatum in which case its all up for grabs
1634529 although ira activity is frequently intensive and highly successful in any particular week or over a period of weeks there are other periods of little or no apparent activity
1634530 well i think that the answer to that is that this is the nature of guerrilla warfare vietnam is the one guerrilla war that people refer to as the textbook guerrilla operation but in fact prior to hardly a shot had been fired after that of course everything changed if you take the algerian struggle actions were few and intermittent cyprus was the same in malaya there were very few brits killed over a three year period the ira suffers from a number of drawbacks firstly unlike many liberation movements there is no government supporting us militarily or financially we have a small land area in which to fight and are one of the few guerrilla armies that lives and fights in the occupied area we are fighting a major world force which has massive resources and at our backs is spending millions of pounds trying to help defeat us we have political enemies throughout the world trying to cut our lines of supply in the occupied area we have over fifty per cent of the population collaborating with the enemy 1169 comment and now these same provos are salaried and suited to share space with those same collaborators our biggest single asset is the nationalist people who by and large support us to varying degrees all our support today lies with our own people just as in 1916 the proclamation said that the irish people were relying for the most part on their own strength so in the light of all the minus points we do have periods when we have an inability to strike and to keep momentum going but if you look back say over a two year period youll see that we do have continuity and we do continue to strike also it should be stressed that while there is a natural ebb and flow caused by logistical problems etc it is a mistake to judge the intensity of the struggle using solely the level of operations as a guideline while operational levels will fluctuate political work in ira based areas like education recruitment and expanding the support base all continue on a daily basis

1634544 the continuing downward trend in consumer confidence is not surprising given the recent batch of poor economic data
1634545 talk of the increasing chances of a recession more weakening in the housing market and the continuing rise of food and energy costs will have further dented confidence as will reports of job losses
1634546 falling oil prices and lower fixed mortgage rates offer some good news but a cut in the bank base rate is still unlikely this summer

1634562 but i think the captaincy might curb his flair as a player
1634563 youve got to look at who will make a difference in the dressing room i thought they might appoint a younger bloke like alastair cook and build him up thats what happened to me
1634564 i am not going to be a wimp and say im not going to do it
1634565 im going to accept this challenge and im going to give it a real good go like i give everything in my life a go

1634577 good regulation should drive competition and boost our productivity but too many new rules can stifle enterprise and blunt our competitive edge
1634578 if the uk is to remain a respected place to do business we must not expect business simply to absorb the costs of a stream of new government initiatives
1634579 the introduction of a regulatory budget for every department will focus new regulations on the real priorities and act as a powerful incentive for departments to cut or streamline existing burdens
1634580 this innovative approach will build on efforts already in place to cut the burden to business by 25 per cent by 2010
1634581 it is difficult for health service estates to maintain a completely pest free
1634582 we need greater transparency in nhs infection control and publishing data like this is one way in which we can drive up overall hygiene standards
1634583 the use of pest control is seen as good proactive management
1634584 the claim that insects spread hospital acquired infections is entirely unproven there is no evidence of their carriage of antibiotic resistant bacteria being a hazard to patients
1634585 despite this we expect hospitals to take continued action to tackle these pest problems

1634589 the one thing we dont want is for kevin to change he averages 50 plus in test and one day cricket and he is an unbelievable talent
1634590 the first innings against south africa in the first test at lords earlier this summer was the one for me
1634591 he is a bit nervous at first but gets his head down and blazes a hundred that is a measure of the man when you see things like that i am sure he will take to captaincy in the same way he will take it in his stride
1634592 it is a tough job it is not just about being on the field moving the field about and changing the bowlers around
1634593 the thing is trying to leave it on the cricket field
1634594 michael said it affected him at home and he took the work home and i did that as well
1634595 you also need help from the rest of the side
1634596 kevin will be fine he is confident single minded and will have a definite approach to how he is going to do it the team have got to perform as well and there is no reason why we cant all be successful together

1634607 he was walking this morning and is looking forward to his release as soon as possible

1634610 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely
1634611 it was so bad i couldnt tell what it was
1634612 watching television about 11 15 and i heard a car sliding on the highway out in front of our house
1634613 as i looked out the window i saw it began to flip after it hit our next door neighbors drive it went end over end about twice and then it came back on its wheels in the ditch it was a mess

1634619 these cars are very different to the norm with a lot of work going into them they are not just badge engineering
1634620 ik vind het geen prestatie iedereen doet toch zijn werk
1634621 in de beginjaren was het hard werken ik kwam soms wel aan tachtig uur in de week de bediening van de beide pontjes is verdeeld in een vroege en een late dienst in de overige uren werk ik aan onderhoud van de pontjes of doe ik het papierwerk en de administratie
1634622 toen ik mijn 61e verjaardag vierde begon ik na te denken over mijn opvolging daar komt een heleboel bij kijken politieke aangelegenheden zoals contacten met de gemeente moeten bekend zijn daarnaast moeten technische weetjes en administratieve taken worden overgedragen uiteindelijk had mijn schoonzoon wel interesse in het bedrijf sinds 1 januari is hij samen met mij eigenaar van het veer af en toe vaar ik nog maar ik ben er vooral voor advies na drie of vier jaar stap ik helemaal uit het bedrijf
1634623 aan de ene kant wel ik mis de fijne band met mijn personeel ook de contacten met de klanten zal ik missen het is soms dolle pret de omgang met het publiek is voor 90 procent het mooie van het werk als veerman aan de andere kant ben ik niet weemoedig het is gewoon een keuze geweest die op enig moment genomen moet worden ik zal ook mijn hele verdere leven aan de pont verbonden blijven daarnaast is het heerlijk dat ik meer vrije tijd heb
1634624 eerst was ik helemaal vergroeid met de pont zelfs in de vakanties was ik druk met mijn werk elke dag belden ze mij wel een paar keer op mijn vrouw vond het maar niks dat zelfs de vakantie voor mij niet anders was dan pont pont en nog eens pont nu is het al veel beter we hebben nu voor het eerst echt vakantie met ons plezierjacht varen we heel nederland door geen telefoontje verstoort onze rust
1634625 jazeker eind jaren negentig hadden we verschillende keren last van ijs op de rivier de pontjes lagen soms wel weken aan de kant dat waren geen goede tijden een ander dieptepunt was de ontdekking van bodemverontreiniging in de zellingwijk in 1982 meer dan honderd gezinnen moesten vanwege gifstoffen ge vacueerd worden dat was een strop voor gouderak verschillende winkeliers zijn door verlies van klanten failliet gegaan wij kwamen er uiteindelijk gelukkig doorheen
1634626 ik ben van mening dat de weg van dialoog de enige is die op de lange termijn vruchten kan afwerpen
1634627 we hebben geen tijd te verliezen als het onderzoek van de provincie onze conclusies steunt willen we de plussen en minnen van de locaties op een rijtje hebben
1634628 de snelheid van de scan zelf en computersoftware maken het mogelijk het hart en de kransslagaders de bloedvaten die het hart van bloed voorzien scherp af te beelden
1634629 zo kunnen we heel nauwkeurig vaststellen waar en in welke mate en fase de ziekte zich voordoet
1634630 in nederland valt aan een politieagent nog wel uit te leggen dat je vijf minuten te lang achter elkaar hebt gereden omdat je niet direct een parkeerplaats kon vinden maar in itali of frankrijk geven ze je gerust tot 28 dagen later nog een boete voor die overtreding in nederland
1634631 de hoge verwachtingen van de jaren tachtig en negentig met betrekking tot behandeling van ernstige ziekten door middel van transplantatie van foetaal weefsel zijn nog niet uitgekomen

1634635 het is jammer dat ons initiatief tot het houden van de informatieve sessies al wordt veroordeeld voordat ze hebben plaatsgevonden
1634636 toen zeiden we tegen fortis we doen wel mee maar we vinden het belangrijk dat er veranderingen komen
1634637 wij vonden die overname geen goed idee maar we hadden moeite om aan het woord te komen
1634638 wij blijven bij onze eerdere verklaring dat er geen aanleiding is om veranderingen door te voeren maar wij bekijken altijd grondig of onze organisatie modernisering behoeft en praten daarover met partijen die daarom vragen
1634639 de economische groei is aan het vertragen maar de diversiteit van onze activiteiten gecombineerd met de groei van de olie en gasmarkt en de sterke orderportefeuille biedt goede bescherming tegen materi le neerwaartse druk

1634643 they have no moral inhibition on the slaughter of the innocent if they could have murdered not 7 000 but 70 000 does anyone doubt they would have done so and rejoiced in it there is no compromise possible with such people no meeting of minds no point of understanding with such terror just a choice defeat it or be defeated by it and defeat it we must
1634644 of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity religion and morality are indispensable supports it is impossible to rightly govern the world without god and the bible
1634645 two defeats is not the way i envisaged coming back with england i didnt wait 18 months to get beaten
1634646 it wasnt ideal but in a perverse way the first one at headingley i enjoyed in the sense of being back around the lads playing in front of a big crowd and playing for england
1634647 i just wish the outcome had been slightly different because for six months ive had to work so hard to get back in the side i am enjoying being there
1634648 ive had a start ive bowled some overs and ive batted okay but now i need to start performing properly
1634649 before this ankle operation i thought if i didnt think i could recapture the form of previously i wouldnt have put myself up for all of this
1634650 i feel i can do that i feel i am getting there but i can rattle on as much as i can about it ive got to start doing it out on the field
1634651 people go on about the ashes next year weve got thursday to concentrate on weve got beaten twice by south africa and weve got to pull it around a bit
1634652 it is not a dead rubber maybe it is in the context of the series but we are playing for england and we are certainly playing for pride
1634653 it is not measured by a trophy or a cheque there is a lot for us to play for as cricketers

1634705 im with a team thats new to me on a new circuit but im optimistic im very familiar with the ferrari 430 car so i hope to be able to step up to the plate and be as competitive as my teammate
1634706 we had a strong beginning to 2005 because we sacrificed 2004 with the regulation change although towards the end we lifted
1634707 last year we had actually had a better season than the results showed and maybe we were given credit for but i think now we have got a good team of people working together and it is coming
1634708 next year is a huge opportunity and a huge risk if you get it right you will be a star and if you get it wrong you will be struggling all season so we are mindful of that
1634709 like everybody we have been working a long time on the 2009 car we are still forcing this car hard but until we actually race in australia next year i dont think anyone will know how they have done
1634710 to be honest i think it will be another couple of weeks before it is 100 percent on the 2009 car
1634711 but even now we have been putting quite a lot of effort onto the 2009 car
1634712 we have been working on it for i suppose nine months to one year but everybody has we think we are good but someone else may be better we need to be paranoid
1634713 daddy you pee out of your body differently i like how you do it better
1634714 note to self make sure bathroom doors are closed before balancing internal fluid levels from now on
1634715 i am going to suggest that we do something that will completely piss you off but i am going to couch it in very impressive language in an attempt to convince you that this is a very good idea and in case that doesnt work there very well could be sexual favors involved if you acquiesce
1634716 i am ready to go to home dept and get some hooks so we can display your ball caps on the wall of the closet
1634717 i know this is important to you but i just dont get it so i give up as a woman i simply do not understand relationship that is inherent between your baseball caps and your penis and i dont think i ever will

1634721 welcome to the first community church of our lord and savior jesus christ
1634722 ushered into the throne room of god in a way that works best with your personal theology
1634723 mom that was really sweet of that lady to bring us a little snack i appreciate that
1634724 jesus is a super hero who lives in my heart and comes out to save the day
1634725 its official beer is cheaper than gas so drink dont drive
1634726 and you love me and sometimes i love you the end
1634727 its a situation i cant handle you just leave it up to god
1634728 i didnt know anything andrews was always happy always smiling but i feel sorry for him im with him but i dont know whats going on everybody goes through their own little problems
1634729 from a human being standpoint you always wish for the best for others
1634730 you dont want anyone to ever have any kind of mental breakdown like that
1634731 but there are distractions every year at training camp the big thing is not to pay as much attention to it as the media does i mean if you want to feed your family you better worry about yourself and what you are doing first
1634732 the only thing ill say is that i know that coach reid has spent an awful lot of time with that situation ill talk about the players that are in camp here
1634733 that is what replay is going to be there for and replay is coming very soon i cant give you a date but its going to be this year
1634734 there are a lot of factors in replay that i could go on and on about there are a lot of ballparks that are not umpire friendly when it comes to border calls thats how they build them theyre fan friendly and they dont want to change that
1634735 do we like that no but you know what were losing that war so well accept it and well move on and deal with however major league baseball wants us to deal with it and thats about all i can say about it but victorinos line drive is a perfect example of why they want replay
1634736 i look at it now and it looks like it just went foul just missed the pole foul ball after talking to the guys nobody was 100 percent sure one way or the other were not going to flip a call unless weve got it 100 percent
1634737 he goes i dont know i think you missed it but i dont know and he was the closest guy to it
1634738 from a technical standpoint why wouldnt we want to get the play right it seems like we were kind of behind the times and everybody knew what the call was except for the four guys umpires on the field
1634739 vitally important that people throughout the limerick county council area continue to enjoy clean healthy water
1634740 we often take our drinking water for granted but at the same time it has such a profound effect on our lives if there was a problem with it we would all be greatly affected that is why this funding is so important i hope these new facilities will now be put in place as soon as possible and the government will continue to provide additional funding to ensure that our water supply is protected

1634756 there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1634757 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1634758 at esri we are always deeply impressed by the innovation of our users
1634759 we want to recognize the efforts of these individuals with our special achievement in gis award this recognition is well deserved for how theyve applied geospatial technology to address the needs of their industries and communities they are defining gis best practices
1634760 one quarter million organizations used arcgis in their work which has been a spectacular endeavor from this group esri expressly acknowledges 150 outstanding users by conferring its
1634761 i believe that gis work is driving change and is creating a digital foundation by abstracting data models and workflows
1634762 our thinking is becoming spatially integrated changing how we reason defining patterns of our actions evolving collaborative structures moreover gis is changing our work to adopt a science based approach we are introducing systems for measuring accounting and analyzing geography then visualizing it to make decisions gis is helping people plan for a more sustainable world gis is raising awareness
1634763 todays gis implementations follow three patterns the desktop for creating and editing data the sever for sharing information to a wider audience and federated systems which join together server technologies for collaborating and sharing information across organizations
1634764 these three patterns provide a foundation for a fourth pattern web gis this pattern provides new opportunities for leveraging your work through web applications it is about harnessing the power of the web with all the power of what you do in gis going far beyond simple mapping or visualization and ultimately becoming a part of societys infrastructure gis professionals will be implementing this infrastructure by authoring and serving knowledge maps and visualizations as well as analytic interpretations and authoritative applications these will be consumed by casual users leveraging our collective knowledge

1634777 you might not agree with these definitions if thats the case then good for you it means you are thinking
1634778 the fsf recommends that people consider using the gnu agpl for any software which will commonly be run over a network
1634779 the gnu gpl has been the most successful free software license because it makes a programs source available to its users this enables massive collaboration between developers since everyone gets the same benefits from this rule the gnu agpl will enable the same kind of cooperation around web services and other networked software
1634780 the feedback we received while working on gplv3 demonstrated a clear desire for this sort of license and thanks to the communitys help during the drafting were happy that the gnu agpl meets those needs
1634781 im the chair of the license approval committee this is my report for the current set of licenses under discussion this finishes up the licenses submitted to license discuss title gnu affero general public license submission http crynwr com cgi bin ezmlm cgi 17 mss 59 apmcgapodhnnfmpgpnmb license http www fsf org licensing licenses agpl 3 0 html comments cowan moen approve no one disapproves recommend approval
1634782 licenses that are popular and widely used or with strong communities
1634783 it requires publication of any modified version that an organization uses even privately
1634784 d for the purposes of determining the right to obtain copies of the source code as well as the right to modify and distribute such source code and object code the term distribution shall include the communication of the program or work based on the program which is intended to interact with third party users meaning anyone other than you or if you are an entity such as a corporation and not an individual that corporation through a computer network and the user shall have the right to obtain the source code of the program or work based on the program this provision is an express condition for the grants of license hereunder and any such communication shall be considered a distribution under section 1 2 and 3
1634785 in short this license grew out of a desire to close loopholes in previous open source licenses loopholes that allowed parties to acquire open source software and derive financial benefit from it without having to release their improvements or derivatives to the community which enabled them
1634786 you can use the gpl terms possibly modified in another license provided that you call your license by another name and do not include the gpl preamble and provided you modify the instructions for use at the end enough to make it clearly different in wording and not mention gnu though the actual procedure you describe may be similar
1634787 if the program as you received it is intended to interact with users through a computer network and if in the version you received any user interacting with the program was given the opportunity to request transmission to that user of the programs complete source code you must not remove that facility from your modified version of the program or work based on the program and must offer an equivalent opportunity for all users interacting with your program through a computer network to request immediate transmission by http of the complete source code of your modified version or other derivative work
1634788 these licenses do not forbid any modification in the softwares useful functionality that is what counts
1634789 you may also choose to redistribute modified versions of this program under any version of the free software foundations gnu general public license version 3 or higher so long as that version of the gnu gpl includes terms and conditions substantially equivalent to those of this licence
1634790 early drafts of gplv3 allowed licensors to add an affero like requirement to publish source in section 7 however some companies that develop and rely upon free software consider this requirement to be too burdensome they want to avoid code with this requirement and expressed concern about the administrative costs of checking code for this additional requirement by publishing the gnu affero gplv3 as a separate license with provisions in it and gplv3 to allow code under these licenses to link to each other we accomplish all of our original goals while making it easier to determine which code has the source publication requirement
1634791 13 use with the gnu affero general public license notwithstanding any other provision of this license you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the gnu affero general public license into a single combined work and to convey the resulting work the terms of this license will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work but the special requirements of the gnu affero general public license section 13 concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such
1634792 now we just need developers to understand that using gpl v3 instead of agpl v3 is just dumb your software is going to be used as a service if not today in a few years yes your software everything is going to be used as a service even word processors they can take it and do not give any changes back to your community wavemaker is smart and they are now using agpl many will follow
1634793 the gpl permits anyone to make a modified version and use it without ever distributing it to others what this company is doing is a special case of that therefore the company does not have to release the modified sources
1634794 my opinion is that the existence of a gpl compatible amp fsf endorsed software license that closes the web app loophole will expand the territory of the now familiar dual licensing business model to hosted user facing web applications particularly where instances of such applications participate in a larger ecology that has its own network effects by sharing and federating data for example
1634795 agpl takes away the freedom to not share which is the same as taking away the freedom to share
1634796 a more interesting twist is if the front end is agpl and the back end is gpl the agpl front end would require the distribution of the version of the gpl licensed back end actually deployed behind the front end but there can be other gpl forks of the back end in use that are not subject to that same requirement and can have their own dual licensing arrangements
1634797 dual licensing is not a perfect model but i like it
1634798 specifically in the scenario where you want to launch an under or non funded open source project for a user facing web application you can host the primary instance of the application at an eponymous domain but others can set up their own instances elsewhere
1634799 i know about the agpl but how widely used is it not very it would need to be the dominant licence for free software used in web construction for it to have an effect
1634800 notwithstanding any other provision of this license if you modify the program your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network if your version supports such interaction an opportunity to receive the corresponding source of your version by providing access to the corresponding source from a network server at no charge through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software this corresponding source shall include the corresponding source for any work covered by version 3 of the gnu general public license that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph
1634801 notwithstanding any other provision of this license you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the gnu general public license into a single combined work and to convey the resulting work the terms of this license will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the gnu general public license
1634802 i agree with what you say and this seems consistent with the fsf guidance where the priority is on
1634803 the ultimate issue with the agpl is that it separates authorship from distribution under the gpl what i am required to distribute as the original author is very clear i only have to distribute what i distribute nothing more and nothing less but with the agpl my distribution requirements are linked to some other event and event which is very difficult to track down since it occurs in a virtual world without easily defined and discrete events
1634804 if the program is expressly designed to accept user requests and send responses over a network then it meets these criteria common examples of programs that would fall into this category include web and mail servers interactive web based applications and servers for games that are played online
1634805 if a program is not expressly designed to interact with a user through a network but is being run in an environment where it happens to do so then it does not fall into this category for example an application is not required to provide source merely because the user is running it over ssh or a remote x session
1634806 to clarify the gpl of course only requires the source to be supplied once you distribute or
1634807 it looks like the fsf want this interpreted as broadly as possible from the rationale of the second draft of the agplv3 at the software remotely through a computer network
1634808 if your version is expressly designed to support such interaction
1634809 you must give back your changes even if you dont distribute

1634830 theres a set of tools called edge that were developed on the naughty dog premises actually by a group of very very senior games programmer some from naughty dog and some from elsewhere
1634831 thats why we think were probably only using 30 or 40 percent of the power of the ps3 right now and theres this great untapped potential

1634843 you must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end which you can never afford to lose with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality whatever they might be

1634947 our duck billed dinosaur grew three to five times faster than any potential predators that lived alongside it
1634948 by the time the duck billed dinosaur was fully grown the tyrannosaurs were only half grown it was a huge size difference
1634949 thats another added bonus when facing predators if you can keep reproducing youre set
1634950 we were shocked at how fast they grew if you look at a cross section of the bone of a nestling or even from within the egg there are huge spaces in which blood supply was going through the bone which means they were growing like crazy
1634951 this study is a stepping stone to a larger comparative study on community changes that impacted dinosaur evolution
1634952 food allergic individuals need to increase the awareness of their food allergy among the people around them

1634962 the pseudo occultism of the present day with its dubious psychism wild theorizing and evidence that cannot stand up to the most cursory examination is but the detritus which accumulates around the base of the mount of vision all such worthless rubbish is not worth the power and shot of argument in order to form a just estimate of the sacred science we must study originals and try to penetrate the minds of the great mystics whose works bear evidence of first hand knowledge of the supersensible worlds
1634963 it is through your body that you realize you are a spark of divinity
1634964 for most of us however we only think seriously of food or sex or money when it becomes a problem which is to say when we feel we are not getting our share when we find ourselves in that situation then i regret to say that meditational visualisations are really not the best way to remedy the lack we are here in a physical condition in a physical world and while in that state we have to abide by the laws appropriate to it

1634976 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
1634977 explained eric peng of peking university in beijing china and lead author of the hubble study
1634978 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1634979 said patrick cote of the herzberg institute of astrophysics in victoria canada
1634980 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from messier 87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1634981 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of messier 87
1634982 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1634983 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1634984 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters centre messier 87 sits at the centre of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the centre probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
1634985 the acs virgo cluster survey xv the formation efficiencies of globular clusters in early type galaxies the effects of mass and environment

1634987 there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1634988 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1634989 it is difficult for health service estates to maintain a completely pest free environment but the level and variety of these infections is concerning
1634990 nottingham university hospitals nhs trust which recorded 1 070 incidents followed by which reported 898 infestations

1635019 if you look around and see the soldiers you automatically feel safer
1635020 i believe we are on the right track to guarantee more safety for citizens to give them the feeling that the state is there and it is serious about fighting crime
1635021 the soldiers make you feel safer but its sad that we need them
1635022 i think it is a good measure as long as it is temporary
1635023 if it lasted longer it would give me a sense of militarization
1635024 no one is afraid of the military but to use them in cities is a media move to cover up the cuts to security forces
1635025 our soldiers are highly professional but they are not trained to maintain public order

1635069 we believe that fitness is just as much a part of green living as the principles of reduce reuse recycle after all what s the point in being carbon neutral if you can t pedal a few miles or climb a flight of stairs some would say that this more blue than green we say it s the total package our quality of life
1635070 we like to say our peoples strengths are our greatest asset
1635071 i look forward to project time because i then contribute to other parts of the business i can nurture my strengths and creativity and get out of the office which means when im with the customer i am more generous with my time and have the energy to be as empathetic as i can
1635072 sometimes the customer just wants reassurance they want to hear our personalities especially if youre an online brand people arent particularly online savvy so we hold their hands through the purchase often they need to feel a level of trust

1635076 its been a honour for all afl fans to be able to watch robert harvey play and a particular pleasure for st kilda supporters for his commitment to his club and his teammates
1635077 for the game itself harvey has been an example of sportsmanship skill and dedication and been one of the great ambassadors for our competition
1635078 we wish him the very best in the run to the finals and he will leave our game as one of our greatest champions as his record testifies
1635079 hell know whether he can cut it or not next year or keep going i wont have to tell him that
1635080 hell make the decision because i think he deserves that right with what hes been through and what hes meant to this football club
1635081 i committed to them that i would give them a farewell game if i could manage it with how the teams going and where were placed now that will be in the lap of the gods depending on what happens in the next two or three weeks
1635082 when you tell the boys that youre retiring its the hardest thing you ever have to do in footy that was a mighty big 15 minutes of my life there
1635083 i was just playing every game like it was going to be my last game because all through my career everyone was telling be because i trained pretty hard and i had injuries and stuff id finish up reasonably early so i expected that to happen too but it sort of just dragged out and dragged out
1635084 hes been a great of the game theres no doubt
1635085 i think theres two things his longevity and the quality of his performances for such a long time and even this year hes still played some very good football and hes been a credit to himself with the way hes been able to play
1635086 hes been an absolute champion of the game to win two brownlow medals if youre looking at role models for younger players i think hes nearly the perfect person to look at with the way he prepares
1635087 he just seemed to be able to keep going and adapt to the modern game even this year ive watched st kilda and hes come off the interchange at the time and got seven or eight disposals in 10 or 12 minutes so in my opinion he was still making a solid impact
1635088 have you tried lying with your legs in the air you know after

1635114 cannot comprehend how many jewish people can speak of the holocaust as well as stating that israel is the holy land and commit the atrocities they are committing against the palestinian people
1635115 shed ourselves from the racist zionists in america they control everything but they wont keep us down any longer throw the jews in the oven this november its the only way we can free america and make sure barack obama is elected
1635116 israel has destroyed its own image in the world and is taking america down with its zionist aggression
1635117 please re think posting material like this we are not interested in an anti israel policy
1635118 the last thing we need is to be aligned with more anti semitic rhetoric jewish conspiracy speculation should be left to the experts at the united nations
1635119 entire congress should be overthrown by revolution for having sold america to the israelis
1635120 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza
1635121 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts
1635122 we have nothing to do with the obama campaign we just like obama and believe he will be the best for the palestinians and for the world
1635123 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama
1635124 maybe we sold the shirts for a lot more i cant remember now
1635125 we dont want to cause any damage to obamas campaign
1635126 not just the people in gaza but people from all over the world are rooting for this great man

1635178 and they took it very seriously confidentiality especially in the las vegas chefs market is of core important and these students were able to finish a great analysis without duress
1635179 but its really no different than the enigma of day trading or forex people are not necessarily afraid of investment process but merely of the high risk involved
1635180 its better to look through the mid range las vegas chefs companies for ones with strong growth potential
1635181 i always tell my las vegas chefs clients to wait at minimum 18 months before evaluating the success of a particular investment
1635182 that way those who get jittery early on allow themselves a chance to see the investment through
1635183 im thrilled to report record growth in the las vegas chefs sector
1635184 this signifies that anyone who invested their money more than three years ago saw a 25 return on their money which is fabulous
1635185 its a shame that our industry isnt seen as more main stream
1635186 if more main stream investors got involved through good brokerages wed see a higher division of risk across the board this is especially important in our business model because if we rely on one or two large investment firms they can end up constantly twisting our elbows
1635187 weve seen more people getting into investing and more company executives doing more aggressive marketing and sales with the knowledge that they are backed by a diverse number of share holders
1635188 be prepared for a wait of on average 3 5 years before expecting any sort of return that is the way the las vegas chefs market works and with patience you can walk with big money

1635255 in germany senator obama made the right decision to respect wounded troops and the doctors and nurses doing crucial and time sensitive work by not making a visit that was characterized as a campaign event by the pentagon
1635256 senator obama has voted for the troops when john mccain has not most recently on the new gi bill i am happy that senator obama puts the welfare of our troops above politics

1635262 it has nothing to do with the execution process the constitutional challenge they filed wont have any effect on the planned execution he said
1635263 it will only have an effect if the constitutional court issues a decision quickly in their favour

1635273 usually when people are taking a holiday to australia they are only given a tourist visa and cannot work he told reporters
1635274 with this agreement our children who are taking a holiday in australia are able to work in all lines of working fields according to the needs there
1635275 there has been no decision by the australian government to have a guest worker scheme with anyone as yet he said
1635276 while you know there is consideration before cabinet about such matters the focus is very much on the south pacific as a trial
1635277 a decision will be taken and announced shortly about that but the focus has always been on both the south pacific and a trial as part of our attempts to stabilise the south pacific economies
1635278 there has not been any formal engagement with indonesia on those issues senator evans said
1635279 this will facilitate the capacity of young people from each country to work and holiday in each others countries he said

1635291 women who have endometriosis express this enzyme in both the early and late stages of the menstrual cycle which means that the cells will continue to divide and lose their focus in supporting the establishment of a pregnancy
1635292 as a result the lining of the womb may be more hostile to an early pregnancy and the cells that are shed at this late stage in the menstrual cycle may be more aggressive and more able to survive and implant outside the uterus causing pain in the pelvic or abdomen area
1635293 this is an interesting piece of research which highlights differences between women with endometriosis and those without
1635294 however whilst we welcome any research which increase our understanding of this condition we appreciate that this is still a long way from providing a complete understanding of the condition or indeed new therapies
1635295 it has been a huge team effort to get to this level and i am delighted with our progress
1635296 however there is more to do if we are to realise the maximum benefits from this discovery
1635297 they produce enzymes that clean wounds they make a wound more alkaline which may slow bacterial growth and finally they produce a range of antibacterial chemicals that stop the bacteria growing
1635298 what we should not have is the central bank involved in its balance sheet
1635299 because that balance sheet is the creator of the monetary base and if you allow major fluctuations in that base as a result of other than monetary policy reasons i think youre taking undue risks with the notion of the stability of the financial system and very specifically the feds control of inflation
1635300 labour have said over and over that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing
1635301 in countries with good standards of healthcare the possibility for insects or pests to transmit infections in hospitals would be very remote
1635302 in the uk wounds are treated appropriately and dressings applied to ensure good hygiene and prevent infection
1635303 how can patients be safe amid bedbugs fleas and rats these findings reveal what happens when money is taken away from where patients expect to see it spent
1635304 if these hospitals were restaurants they would be closed down and out of business
1635305 clearly it may be necessary to take action against pests in these large public buildings from time to time
1635306 however it is important for hospital trusts to have robust procedures in place to deal with any pest problems
1635307 the hygiene code requires nhs bodies to have a pest control policy that anticipates and manages this issue
1635308 trusts should take rapid action and follow through with surveillance in place to avoid pest incidents and minimize hazards
1635309 use of pest control is a sign of good proactive management

1635311 syron encouraged the boston feds research department to wade into important but contentious public policy issues perhaps best known was its study of lending discrimination which found race not lending risks driving loan decisions the study helped change lending practices and expand credit to minority and poor neighborhoods in taking on the issue syron was virtually alone in the financial industry
1635312 are the sub prime northern rock fannie mae and freddie mac fiascos connected with the increase in cohabitation
1635313 the signal that we send to our banks is that we want to continue lending but we want healthy lending we want good risk management we want well underwritten loans to credit worthy borrowers
1635314 what great adventures come in books lets discover some this month
1635315 we are preparing the chargesheet for prosecution against espn software india also we are writing to the ministry of information and broadcasting recommending them to cancel their downlinking licence over non conformation to the dth pricing
1635316 i cannot offer any comments in the matter till i actually hear from trai
1635317 however any pre condition in following the pricing formula on dth platform by the sports broadcaster is unacceptable to trai therefore it is supposed to have initiated the neccessary action against the sports channel
1635318 we hope to launch operations in these regions in next two months preparations are on towards this including creating branch network distribution channels and sales points it is a matter of time for us to make it big in these regions as we have done in the southern region
1635319 we are probably the only dth player in the asian region to have roped in over one million plus customers in a short span six months since its launch we want to replicate the success in these regions
1635320 our strength lies in offering different packages for different segment of people unlike others ours is a common man product which comes with a right packaging at right cost the packaging will be unique and the pricing will also be equally unique
1635321 we hope to have at least one million subscribers in the first year of operations in these regions
1635322 our strengthes lie in understanding the profile of a customer regional focus pricing model offering services with latest technology based equipment
1635323 casey brings a wealth of energy experience and integrity to our program and he has been exposed to some of the best mentors in golf
1635324 while this is a minor setback for delvon we are glad that he will be able to return to action by the time practice starts in mid october i am confident that he has the work ethic and dedication needed for a successful rehab
1635325 fortunately for me i sat behind a quarterback drew stanton for several years and got to learn from him so ive just tried to take that role and teach him if he has a question
1635326 and trust me kirk doesnt hesitate to ask a question thats a good thing
1635327 i broke my ankle and i remember thinking that i wasnt going to be able to play college football at all because of it
1635328 i started working really hard in the summer before my senior year and put on some weight i was about 170 175 pounds i was still low on the radar and a lot of people werent interested
1635329 but i felt like if i played well enough id have a chance and michigan state gave me that opportunity
1635330 obviously we recruited him believing in him and feeling like he could be a very good quarterback for us
1635331 were not surprised by his progression kirks done absolutely everything ive asked of him physically and mentally hes put on a lot of good weight since last year and his mental approach has been fantastic
1635332 as a scout team member he didnt really sit in on meetings with the starters last year once we got into the season so he missed out on a lot of development in understanding the offense and defenses as soon as he got the opportunity in the spring he took it running and hes got a great understanding of the offense right now
1635333 when i was in that situation you got to be ready to play every game you have to prepare every week like youre the starter
1635334 being a backup quarterback people think its the easiest position in the world but its really not you never know when youre going to get thrown into the fire and i think thats something kirk will be able to handle
1635335 he knows him from the minor leagues he needs to get a game pick a spot and play him
1635336 he is going to have an immediate impact on this team he is so strong and can dip and move like i have never seen anyone can before
1635337 i had to take 19 credits in the fall 18 in the spring and 11 in the summer so a total of 48 i passed them all i did pretty well in my classes too
1635338 when they first told me i lost so many credits transferring i actually went to my room and cried i was like im going home i cant take that many credits but it was easier than i thought it was
1635339 it became difficult but i just kept my mind focused on football which is the main reason why im here
1635340 the thing trevor will give us is that he knows our defense and thats a plus for us
1635341 he has great speed quickness and the ability to rush the passer trevor will be a little bit quicker than both of those guys baldwin and saint dic and he will be able to use his hands better than those guys we are real excited to have him here
1635342 it was a little thing that was holding me back for a second so that gave me a couple problems but i got that taken care of and now im ready to go
1635343 it is an outstanding teaching environment for our football team right now
1635344 we want to make sure we do things the right way
1635345 i want to make sure we do things the way that coach dantonio wants it done and thats my primary focus on the job
1635346 my goal is to do the best job i possibly can at michigan state and were going to follow all the ncaa rules and go to the rose bowl
1635347 maar allez dat kan toch niet nu heeft er mij nog iemand genomineerd
1635348 maar allez dat kan toch niet nu heeft er mij nog iemand genomineerd
1635349 do not even think of lying to me you piece of shit
1635350 she was with you when you called me last night amp you knew i was frantic amp worried how fucking dare you
1635351 who in the fuck do they think that they are dealing with
1635352 if the international community gets behind this project the rebuilding of afghanistan is possible
1635353 wir sind sowohl f r weiteres organisches als auch f r externes wachstum gut aufgestellt

1635355 alles in allem ist die finanzkrise noch nicht zum stillstand gekommen und wird auch das zweite halbjahr 2008 beeintr chtigen
1635356 sometimes you dont realize these things until you sit there as a coach and get asked the questions but were deep
1635357 hes a lot more mature physically and mentally than denson is right now
1635358 stop the diet and bang look at him hes a linebacker
1635359 he is as tough as anybody on our football team
1635360 he will hit hes not afraid to hit go through the last three years special teams tape and you wont think hes soft i hope opponents go in saying that theyll probably think thats a matchup they should go after thats great
1635361 the competition is making us both better but well see what happens at the end of camp
1635362 i just go in every day and my goal is to work hard every day and do what i do
1635363 its not that you dont trust the other guys but when we put him in we feel we have the best chance of getting it accomplished
1635364 were all getting reps coach is just trying to see what were made of
1635365 hes seeing who wants to fight and who wants it most
1635366 he had a good day of practice monday hes a very good football player but people fluctuate
1635367 when youre 320 pounds one day and 330 the next day thats a big meal hes got to get his weight down around 319 but he ran well for 330
1635368 im not a fullback i can do some things that a fullback does but ive been playing on the line of scrimmage my whole life its tough for me to go back there its a whole different position
1635369 it actually helped me grow in a way too because i learned the protections learned the offense more instead of just understanding what ive got to do on the line of scrimmage
1635370 it helped me see the whole picture so it was good in that aspect
1635371 but as far as being in a three point stance and leading up on a linebacker it was just not me
1635372 when youre not doing what youre supposed to do theyll make you pay its a lot easier on yourself when you do things the way youre supposed to do it youre not going to overpower everybody
1635373 you can lift the weight room up but if you dont have quick feet you dont have power
1635374 you cant convert your weight room into football this guys got great feet
1635375 when the feet are in contact with the ground youve got power when theyre out of the ground youve got no power
1635376 hell jolt you like a boxer that quick punch hes got that explosion into you
1635377 this team can play without me i dont think this team will play any differently having me here or not
1635378 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1635379 whats happened is just what i was afraid of you have to ease them through this year yet because it takes time to get over all that shoulder stuff thats not an easy way to have to operate but thats what were doing
1635380 if you cant hold one two run leads late and im not talking about zumaya im talking about anybody youre not going to win
1635381 weve got all the momentum going for us weve got zumaya coming in fresh we just didnt get it done
1635382 not getting the ball where he wants to get it
1635383 when you throw it 97 98 its better up than down
1635384 they drop the head of the bat on it and thats what happens ever since hes been in the big leagues when he gets hurt with the long ball its always on a fastball down
1635385 some people have to do better or there will be some changes
1635386 the detroit lions give their fans and even passive football fans in the detroit area absolutely no reason to support the team other than a blind obligation to do so
1635387 i know this league i know its my contract year i know theyre probably wondering what i can do if i can be the guy
1635388 but it comes down to i cant make them think im the guy unless i think im the guy the 10 other guys on the field arent going to think im the guy unless i think im the guy
1635389 the guy who this organization looks to and says thats our starting quarterback thats what i want to be thats my goal
1635390 is that going to happen i cant tell the future but im doing everything i can to make them see that to prepare myself for that moment so when it comes im ready for it
1635391 injuries in this league are like that i dont want to miss a beat in that area
1635392 that was a very probably one of the most difficult times of my life because i didnt have any answers of why i wasnt talking to anybody i was just trying to stay focused keeping the faith and doing my job
1635393 its almost like i havent played in two years to be honest
1635394 it was difficult for doubt not to creep in because you start to think ok why am i not playing i havent played can i play
1635395 i wouldnt say this if i didnt think it was possible but i honestly think i can play and be good really really good
1635396 to sit here and tell you all the things i learned from him i wouldnt have enough time
1635397 whether they were things that people perceived as good or bad i learned from them
1635398 but then when i get that opportunity to not give it back to anyone else
1635399 it was a problem with the hydraulics its not the end of the world
1635400 everyone who knows me knows i abhor prejudice of any kind i am an old fashioned liberal
1635401 i have no earthly recollection of this interview taking place or of making any such comments which would have dated from 50 years ago

1635407 hold off on that offer ill take the house off the market and we can split the realtors fee
1635408 after every free throw we hit all five men on the court scream their lungs out for a full 3 seconds it will totally freak out some of those smaller countries like angola
1635409 well all wear bright white suits during press conferences and at photo shoots for games we can bleach our hair and paint our finger nails white it will be hot
1635410 listen i just learned how to do a french seam by hand and can totally teach you guys the basics we could customize the stitching on our jerseys in no time
1635411 well cut each fan in attendance a five dollar check and tell them to go out and buy something nice for themselves
1635412 if we tell ourselves we are worthy of gold at least 3 times a day then i dont see any reason why we arent
1635413 my cousin knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a place where you can get an operation done to have a laser beam dispenser implanted into your finger its supposedly pretty painless
1635414 all i know is that taking hard fouls in the paint wouldnt hurt nearly as much
1635415 ive actually been looking into this for a while now and figure why not make it a team effort social security numbers are floating around out there just asking to be stolen

1635421 heres the other one in science fiction when we cant express ourselves if were angry or were upset or emotional we hug and kiss a character or we shoot them or blast them in musical theatre we start singing songs
1635422 in series one we were like a young kid learning how to walk in series two we are up and running we know exactly where we are we know what were about
1635423 i am part of that crazy fan base when i was a child i watched dr who i hid behind the sofa like everybody else
1635424 i knew when i got involved what the history was when captain jack was created it was a great opportunity a great role when they told me i was getting torchwood and they were making me my own show theres the responsibility of the many many years of dr who culture that you kind of have to respect and honour
1635425 before they really got to know me a lot of people in britain thought i was canadian i only speak with a scottish accent when i am with my immediate family or when im up in glasgow
1635426 i am my product in my business i love what i do i enjoy what i do and i see my business being the different aspects of the entertainment industry
1635427 im telling you its true because a british newspaper did try to make out that i was telling a lie i am telling the story as i know it when i contacted my agent and asked them to find out why i wasnt cast my agent came back and told me i was not gay enough i was too straight
1635428 when the newspaper came out with that i had to defend myself i was a little bit angry because i wouldnt lie about something like that its just totally hysterical that a gay man was not gay enough to play the part of a gay character
1635429 theres about a three month period there that was very blurry to me where i had periods of being quite coherent and doing things and then i would lose it and take off on a bender for many days at a time
1635430 i became very negative and i really didnt care about anything towards the end i just was this self absorbed negative individual
1635431 look at the international superstar drunk as a skunk trying to smoke a cigar he just dumped his wife and the bank took his car hes an international superstar
1635432 i really got out of the mode of trusting my instincts and i think a lot of that was because i was pretty messed up
1635433 it got to the point where i dont think i was dealing correctly with reality and not judging not able to focus in on my instincts when it came to writing everything gets affected by that and sometimes in a positive way and unfortunately most of the time in a negative way
1635434 our tour rider was huge a huge huge rider of alcohol
1635435 were talking like two large bottles of wine and a bottle of vodka and a bottle of schnapps and a bottle of scotch and 48 beer and anything else that you may want in there and you know if youre really smart about it then you can do things in moderation and have no problem with it but im not like that
1635436 committed to teaching children about the world they live in
1635437 a decade from now this will be just a funny historical footnote
1635438 ive argued all along that the real heart of web 2 0 is the ability of networked applications to harness collective intelligence yes you can harness collective intelligence to build amazing internet businesses as the past five years have shown us but what good is collective intelligence if it doesnt make us smarter in an era of looming scarcities economic disruption and the possibility of catastrophic ecological change its time for us all to wake up to take our new superpowers seriously and to use them to solve problems that really matter
1635439 we scratched and we clawed and we pulled some runs together ive been talking about that all year long the will to fight
1635440 it feels like youre hitting on sound at that point in time
1635441 hes one of those guys that obviously throws a very plus plus fastball in that situation all i was really trying to do was put the barrel on the ball hes generating so much power with his fastball if you hit it solidly which is going to go a long way
1635442 i can count probably four other times that its been like this

1635456 i think the audience will really enjoy him letting loose like that
1635457 if you look at most of these r rated movies that found an audience its because they were really good
1635458 the r rating allows the filmmakers to truly realize their vision theres just a freedom that comes with it theres no way wedding crashers could have been wedding crashers if you inhibit what it was that owen wilson and vince vaughn were able to do in that movie
1635459 we were like gosh everyones getting to have their cake and eat it too with 40 year old virgin and wedding crashers
1635460 just this little opening seemed to happen with the way the studios were willing to go ok r rated movies seem to be profitable so well maybe open that door a little bit

1635473 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1635474 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights

1635484 when you look at canadian society the way it has changed over the last 40 years it has changed dramatically especially when it comes to gender relations and these womens groups are largely responsible for that

1635492 the pace was unbelievable i mean ive been watching mls for probably 10 years and i think that was one of the best games ive ever seen being in the back i can say that i watched it because i wasnt in the thick of it the pace was good and houston is a great team and they kept coming at us
1635493 you try to play it cool but i knew the weight of it
1635494 im the new guy on the revolution so i wanted to make sure i hit the back of the net
1635495 igwe would tell you that he didnt hear us calling him off and he thought he had to clear the ball that stuff is going to happen hes a young guy who bounced back from that and played great
1635496 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1635497 basically they put out a statement designed to say were content where we are at and all things considered were going to stay put and watch and wait
1635498 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1635499 this language would indicate no near term change in monetary policy

1635502 some research even suggests that high doses of antioxidants can make cancer treatment less effective reducing the benefits of radiotherapy and chemotherapy
1635503 does this post play unhelpfully into the pernicious and growing obamaism as cult that well likely see repeated over and over by the right wing if obama gets the nomination
1635504 it does sorry but obamas rhetoric makes an undeniable suggestion that his election not an eight year administration that successfully implements his vision for america would represent a moment in america of the grandest most transformative kind and thats a bit much
1635505 well look if thats the criteria by which we are making decisions on the deployment of u s forces then by that argument you would have 300 000 troops in the congo right now where millions have been slaughtered as a consequence of ethnic strife which we havent done
1635506 buckle up it makes it harder for the aliens to suck you out of your car
1635507 i see this season as more of a transition i want to put my foot in the door and get more run outs
1635508 it does look very promising we have two front players who will get goals and that is the key to it all
1635509 if we carry it on well be a difficult team to play against
1635510 the fans are right to have the confidence that we can go up thats for sure
1635511 im a gamer and the chance to act in one of the best loved videogames was an opportunity i was really keen to explore especially as eva is such a strong female character
1635512 said gemma demonstrating an amazing ability to speak without really saying anything
1635513 the worlds of gaming and film are getting ever closer and as an actress i wanted to explore this exciting new area of drama broaden my acting skills and continue the active outgoing side of my personality that i showed in im a celebrity get me out of here
1635514 i cant say i completely understood why persian poets who for centuries had likened the male tool to a reed pen also compared the mouths of us women to inkwells or what lay behind such comparisons whose origins had been forgotten through rote repetition was it the smallness of mouth
1635515 you can tell them you were spreading salve onto my wounds
1635516 a poor way to show were better than they are
1635517 the world is divided into good people and bad people with the bad ones all deserving death
1635518 yes i am waiting to wake him for a new job interview
1635519 hes been happy with his bats but i had a bat that he really liked and he started using it the first innings
1635520 i think hell be using that for the end of the year as well because its a freakish bat
1635521 it sounds a bit boring but were really into our bats and we always tinker around with handles together and when i got that bat he kind of liked it and i was reluctant to let it go
1635522 the risks were obvious and should have been assessed a little more carefully the result is there was a crisis affecting the games
1635523 we talked about everything that has happened since this whole process started
1635524 we rehashed all the different things thats gone on we agreed and disagreed our whole focus was was he a member of our football team and where was his mind at he was not at the proper mindset to be part of our football team
1635525 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1635526 i understand the attention he gets for being in his position i think that he has the tools mentally physically emotionally whos had better training than aaron rodgers in being an nfl qb i believe in aaron because hes very talented
1635527 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1635528 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1635529 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1635530 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1635531 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1635532 i just know we were out at practice today and he wasnt there and im the starter
1635533 everything went kind of sour a few weeks or a month back but you never felt like it would get to the point or to the talks of him actually being traded
1635534 i felt once he stepped back in here he would be the quarterback him not being here today i guess management has a different route so at that point weve got to go out and do our job
1635535 das ist nicht meine mama das ist eine fremde die haben mich von meiner mama weggenommen die haben mich aus den ferien weggeholt
1635536 there have to be some places on the planet where you dont go for energy production
1635537 they have taken natural landscapes and turned them into industrial sites
1635538 the coalition gives us the chance to increase the volume and to represent ourselves as mainstream
1635539 i dont think this can go ahead this area is far too valuable there is a saying in business if you want to make omelettes you have to break eggs we dont want to be those eggs
1635540 well she is an amazing girl and anyone would be lucky to be dating her
1635541 like i said anyone would be lucky to be dating her
1635542 i think she is a part of our music video and that is why all the rumors started but yeah shes a cool girl
1635543 i am just going to wait for him to say yes
1635544 where would i go since i have been on tour since february it is a little tough to have much time to go out
1635545 she is a great girl and i think anyone would be lucky to be dating her
1635546 i think anyone would love to go on a date with her
1635547 a family friend from new jersey that goes way back
1635548 w rden wir sie als feindliche k mpfer betrachten und wahrscheinlich hinterher noch eine zeitlang festhalten
1635549 es gibt einen erheblichen anteil von gefangenen in guantanamo die wahrscheinlich nie freigelassen werden weil sie eine gefahr f r die welt darstellen
1635550 zumindest kurzfristig w rden wir ihn weiter als feindlichen k mpfer und als gefahr einstufen
1635551 im aufsichtsrat ist das thema feindliche bernahme sehr intensiv diskutiert worden
1635552 es ist nicht so dass die konzernf hrung glaubt dass hannibal vor den toren steht
1635553 aber die sorgen sind gewachsen und man geht sehr ernsthaft mit dieser situation um
1635554 die autoindustrie f hrt ja nicht gerade in einen cabrio sommer
1635555 das ist das gute an der situation wir sehen derzeit keinen logischen k ufer f r daimler
1635556 da sind nationale interessen betroffen das k nnte auch den deutschen staat zum handeln bewegen
1635557 its been an unusual spirit of co operation but i think its going to deliver the goods for cleaner air
1635558 its not every day you get a letter from the chemical producers and the sierra club co signed
1635559 the fact that were working in this pressure cooker that anybody can basically torpedo this process by pulling out of it is whats keeping us together
1635560 we all want an alternative to what the federal government originally proposed i think theres a consensus that there are some real fundamental flaws in it so we all know that we can only come up with that alternative if we all keep working together
1635561 in some areas we see very high ambient air emissions and in other areas we see less
1635562 so you may manage areas differently depending on how big a problem you have environmentally
1635563 es kann nicht sein dass die herren ber 50 sich einigen und ich erfahre daraus aus der zeitung
1635564 zwar sind wir im team alle vertraut mit dem thema doch es gab auch ein angstgef hl ob wir die dsa community zufrieden stellen k nnen
1635565 als ich auf einem fan treffen mit sehr speziellen fragen gel chert wurde habe ich erst einen schreck bekommen
1635566 die alten pc spiele haben am rand von aventurien gespielt um einer vernetzung zu entgehen wir haben gesagt wir gehen da rein und vernetzen unser spiel mit der bestehenden welt
1635567 den beliebten zauberer rakorium haben wir ebenfalls schon vor zwei jahren hinsichtlich des computerspiels aufgebaut und ihn ber drei artikel verstreut richtung ferdok gef hrt
1635568 der spieler soll eine homogene welt vorfinden die glaubhaft ist
1635569 es war schwierig aus dem riesigen vorlagenberg das auszuw hlen was man umsetzen will
1635570 ohne die n he zur materie kann man das thema nicht vern nftig umsetzen
1635571 nichts mit den drogen zu tun hatte die in der wohnung von heath ledger gefunden wurden
1635572 wir der beh rde alle relevanten chronologischen fakten die den tod von mr ledger angehen haben zukommen lassen
1635573 mrs olsen kennt die quelle der drogen die in der wohnung von mr ledger gefunden wurden nicht
1635574 wir sind weiterhin der ansicht dass die atp dem hamburger turnier den masters status zu unrecht entzogen hat
1635575 das turnier am rothenbaum war immer eines der h chsten kategorie und der masters status ist uns zeitlich unbegrenzt zuerkannt worden solange wir die regularien der atp erf llen m sste dieser statuts jedes jahr erneuert werden
1635576 die geschworenen und der richter haben unser recht anerkannt nderungen am atp kalender durchzuf hren die notwendig sind um das volle potenzial unseres sports auszusch pfen
1635577 das gericht erkannte damit auch an dass diese nderungen in transparenter und vertrauensvoller weise durchgef hrt wurden
1635578 f r mich ist ein traum in erf llung gegangen
1635579 das 100 meter rennen hat damals der ben johnson gewonnen ein bisschen illegal
1635580 ich denke schon dass dirk nowitzki als weltstar eine erw nschte wirkung auf junge leute im land hat
1635581 das ist eine riesensache f r mich ich f hle mich wahnsinnig geehrt
1635582 hey amerika ich bin paris hilton und auch ich bin eine ber hmtheit nur stamme ich weder aus alten zeiten noch verspreche ich wandel wie der andere typ ich bin einfach hei
1635583 ich vermute das hei t ich kandidiere f r das pr sidentenamt
1635584 ich m chte dass amerika wei dass ich absolut bereit bin dass kommando zu bernehmen
1635585 ich sehe euch dann im wei en haus oh das werde ich pink streichen ich hoffe das ist okay f r euch jungs
1635586 paris hilton ist vielleicht nicht eine so gro e ber hmtheit wie barack obama aber sie hat offenbar das bessere programm f r die energiepolitik
1635587 in einer zeit in der millionen leute ihre h user und ihre jobs verlieren
1635588 cutting body parts from the victim and eating those body parts
1635589 when the construction is complete travel on the highway will be safer and more reliable for tourists residents and truckers
1635590 and there will be fewer traffic tie ups on this crucial national commercial transportation artery
1635591 upgrading the trans canada highway from coast to coast is one of our highest priorities
1635592 and todays announcement is an important step forward in that plan
1635593 theres been a concentrated effort over the past 20 years to improve our knowledge and expertise working with elephants and bulls
1635594 we really didnt get a good effort by a lot of different institutions to breed elephants in a co operative manner until the last 15 or 20 years
1635595 theres nothing like being up close to them to realize the size and beauty and intelligence
1635596 theyre under more and more pressure due to habitat loss
1635597 he said 60 so i bought the laptop from him for 60
1635598 i kind of roughly pieced it together i figured he was the guy who was the victim
1635599 he seemed like such a nice guy when i talked to him he was not mean or fidgety or anything he had like no emotion to him but he didnt seem like he was a very nasty guy he just seemed calm and normal
1635600 hes very humble and he was just as worried about his own rear end as his buddy that was hurt as well
1635601 bob has a crack in the left side of his hip
1635602 the impact that they had the way the doctor described it was that it was like pulling every muscle in his body in one shot
1635603 then he couldnt get a signal again and what he proceeded to do was start texting once he had a contact from search and rescue
1635604 the plane crashed at 7 15 a m and they didnt finally triangulate him until 4 30
1635605 he had very little battery power left and when we were looking at his phone and reading the text messages that went back and forth right smack in the middle was two marketing texts that came in from telus
1635606 i believe this is the first time someone has resorted to texting
1635607 it is good and good to remind people that when a signal is too weak for voice communication you may still be able to communicate by text
1635608 i also want to take this time to extend an olive branch to police chief keith mccaskill so we can sit at a table and talk about how we are going to reduce not only crime but the killing sprees that seem to be enjoyed by the winnipeg police service
1635609 it looks like the winnipeg police service is acting like the top dog or the no 1 gang in the city of winnipeg
1635610 it is unacceptable for the police to have killed our youth
1635611 there are a lot of monday morning quarterbacks out there that are willing to look in hindsight and find fault
1635612 you really have split seconds to make decisions with aggressive armed individuals
1635613 i think they were pulling something like this in an effort to bury the story and bury the issue and not just that but make it impossible for anyone else to respond
1635614 the department has nothing further to add after the ministers statement and making the report and summary of actions public
1635615 no one gives you a manual on how to govern
1635616 but i know there is more that unites us than divides us
1635617 i was at hexham last weekend and dean said a couple of words to me i could tell he was finding it agonising but he kept soldiering on watching him in the final event the 1500m brought a lump to my throat
1635618 i went to california for warm weather training with dean earlier this year
1635619 i learnt a lot from him on that trip he showed great professionalism in the way he conducted himself in the way he co operated with physios and in the manner which he spoke to greg
1635620 i cant believe he wont be competing anymore but i fear if he carried on he would have done himself some damage he said this was going to be his final year its just a shame he didnt finish his career with a third olympics
1635621 the decathletes and heptathletes tend to compete at different meetings to the others but at least i know kelly sotherton and im good friends with julie hollman
1635622 going out there with the team will be pretty special ill be wow theres simeon williamson and phillips idowu i hope they take me under their wings
1635623 my coach greg is good friends with daley and this larger than life image appeared in my mind whenever he talked about him
1635624 daley told me i would enjoy the olympics and that the first experience would blow my mind he also told me to watch all the top names like roman sebrle and bryan clay and not to be scared to ask them questions so i could learn and become a better athlete
1635625 when someone like that gives you that sort of advice you listen
1635626 the main thing for me is to learn from this experience the crowd the competition the big names travelling with the team and being an olympian
1635627 im hoping to break the magical 8 000 points mark
1635628 london 2012 is my target and by then ill have trained harder and ill be stronger and faster
1635629 also habe ich meine frau und meine zwei s hne genommen und bin die ganze zeit rumgelaufen ich war die ganze zeit n chtern ich war wahrscheinlich die einzige person die sehen konnte was ein paar meter weiter vor ihren f en passiert
1635630 schon am ersten tag ging es los da haben die leute sich ausgezogen
1635631 aber die meinten nur nein ich muss hierbleiben um dieses bild von hendrix zu schie en
1635632 ich bin vorbei gegangen und dieses eine paar stand da und umarmte sich da habe ich ein paar bilder gemacht
1635633 in dem moment an dem ort wenn das gew hnliche episch wird bin ich gl cklich am leben zu sein meine kamera dabei zu haben und zu sehen
1635634 ich glaube dass das nicht einmal ann hernd den gefahren und den ngsten gleicht mit denen die tibeter unter der besatzung durch die chinesische regierung leben
1635635 erstens den chinesen meinen respekt zu erweisen und zweitens die us mannschaft anzufeuern
1635636 zum herbst werden wir preissteigerungen zwischen vier und sechs prozent in deutschland aber auch in anderen europ ischen l ndern im markt durchsetzen m ssen
1635637 hausger te sind sehr materialintensive produkte wir sp ren ganz massiv die preiserh hungen vor allem bei stahl aber auch bei energie weil unsere transportkosten relativ hoch sind
1635638 wir haben noch nie eine produktion verlagert haben aber neue standorte im ausland gegr ndet weil dort neue m rkte entstehen
1635639 qu vista qu espect culo ya puedo morirme despu s de ver esto
1635640 this is a very partisan issue before us its very serious and im taking it seriously ive got my papers in order
1635641 i dont rule that out being part of the ones they found in canada
1635642 once it hits the straits of juan de fuca and it had an outgoing tide if it was carrying it out to the open water and it hit a strong west wind it could kick it out
1635643 its now clear that in fact he has a very strong defence to this extradition
1635644 he should now be released pending the completion of the extradition proceedings
1635645 theyre trying to smear the reputation of an islamic religious institution without any basis at all
1635646 its going to be extraordinarily cumbersome and inconvenient if we have to stop the proceeding and clear the courtroom every time this information is referred to because well be referring to it all the time
1635647 the relationship was consensual and it ended earlier this year after a period of some months
1635648 i take responsibility for my being involved in this relationship and i regret the hurt caused to anyone including my family
1635649 i feel this statement is warranted to put the facts in context given the media interest
1635650 i have medical advice that i am suffering from depression and have been for some time
1635651 i hope that the media will respect the privacy of myself and my family as i make my recovery
1635652 i wish to thank all those people who have expressed their good wishes and offers of support
1635653 bestellt was ihr wollt verdient euch das geld daf r aber zuvor etwa mit tellerwaschen singen stra enakrobatik pantomime
1635654 when she woke me up she asked why there were all these strangers e mailing her telling her to marry me
1635655 the focus is having a comprehensive report rather than looking at the deadline the public should remain patient as the results of the report will be known once it reaches the presidents office
1635656 i have in my capacity as the chairman of the committee requested the speaker to advise the government on the direction it is taking with the epa investigations
1635657 is doing is illegal and only meant to buy time to prevent the charging in a court of the masterminds of the epa scam
1635658 there have been reports that mwanyika and company are preparing to hand over a report on epa to president kikwete the team was not supposed to give any new report but to take action against the suspects named in the investigation by audit firm ernst and young
1635659 against entertaining any delays by the mwanyika team by accepting a report instead of demanding that they crack the whip as directed
1635660 such a letter must have the consent of all committee members and not written by an individual
1635661 the decision to forward the letter to the speaker followed our committees meeting with the management of bank of tanzania bot during which we scrutinised its audited accounts for last year
1635662 because parliamentary procedures require that committees table their reports every april i as the chairman acted on the epa issue because it is urgent and could not wait until next year
1635663 but there is nothing to hide because epa is a serious national issue that requires all of us to play our roles appropriately
1635664 as we speak now our inspector general mr john parsons is currently in uganda
1635665 so i am requesting uganda to conduct the investigations and that the money is returned to us and we will keep the pressure on the country we will mobilize the press and the public opinion until we have those monies
1635666 most tsetse fly traps set out are stolen by residents and converted into clothes or bedsheets
1635667 i am worried that some of the residents might bring the rags into close contact with children or use them to cover food stuffs and kill themselves in the process the traps are impregnated with dangerous chemicals that could harm the people
1635668 to a certain extent the existence of adverse poverty has compelled most residents to lose sense of protection against the deadly disease vector insects
1635669 since the fishermen are now too poor to afford the ever increasing prices of fishnets this seemed an opportunity to continue catching more fish without buying nets
1635670 the few illegally used nets were confiscated on operations which were held when the beach management unit members were not aware
1635671 we cannot afford fishnets so we decided to use the mosquito nets where they can benefit us most in fact government should bring us more
1635672 we held long discussions and reached the decision that students will continue paying the new fares to match the costs of operating commuter buses
1635673 the branding objective is to improve the product quality and packaging that will bypass middlemen of the traditional floral supply chains and auctions and offer the consumer better and fresher flowers
1635674 because of poor packaging the roses arrive on the market damaged although not all arrive in a poor state all our flowers are labelled c and d upon arrival in amsterdam the c and d are letters marked on boxes containing inferior quality flowers
1635675 national conference on education of the girl child in nigeria
1635676 in several states of the north primary school classes are still held under the shade of trees in the open
1635677 why should a small planning elite foster its zoning plans on all
1635678 zoning should be a given there is bad zoning and good zoning and we must look at ways to highlight the good zoning and curb the bad zoning
1635679 all persons are born free and equal in dignity and rights everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration without distinction of any kind
1635680 gt more information on touch diamond and raphael for both sprint and verizon
1635681 gt htc to launch touch diamond with sprint this month android phones in q4
1635682 it did seem a bit strange to me but i just have this rule that no one goes near another vessel
1635683 restrict supply to genuine cases of treatment of short term pain
1635684 the adverse side effects and problems happen over a long period of time not usually in short treatment bursts so limiting pack sizes would be the way to go
1635685 and we look forward to having the issue investigated further to understand the situation more thoroughly
1635686 the psa is not aware of any published evidence of widespread misuse apart from newspaper articles based on anecdotal reports
1635687 patent pending cinematic artificial intelligence technology and high end motion design
1635688 nmb is there for tanzanians and assisting groups of people in their associations like saccos is one of our agenda let all saccos mini banks follow steps made by mwananchi saccos to benefit from us
1635689 we want to see at least one of the perpetrators arrested that would bring some hope and deter other perpetrators
1635690 we are supposed to educate our people who must by now understand that albinos are human beings
1635691 the mufti was constitutionally and legally elected by the muslims of tanzania and not those in dar es salaam alone
1635692 we have 1 850 mosques in dar alone yet those who want the mufti to resign are just a few dozen
1635693 the mufti told sheikh kilemile that there are no personal biases in his decision as he only wants to make a better bakwata
1635694 more changes are taking place and so they might find themselves put into other positions in the country if possible
1635695 though they do not yet fully understand the proposals as they do not know which is to be the basis of amendments if its the blueprint of 2006 or of 2008
1635696 constitutional amendments can never be done without the muftis consent and these expelled sheikhs made a mistake as they thought the amendments could be forwarded without the muftis signature
1635697 the headquarters is not that big to have more than sixty employees
1635698 look we cant cleanse the country of criminals so here we are doing our best to atleast cleanse it from acts which are not in indian culture
1635699 buffets have changed so much since the old one opened 13 years ago expectations are higher than ever we want to get locals back downtown
1635700 steve wynn always does the best buffets the best restaurants in the casino industry
1635701 because were of italian american heritage we wanted the italian food front and center
1635702 allowed us to think about the world differently to see it as a seamless whole
1635703 think about the world as a single market a single ecosystem and a single community
1635704 crude foundation of a whole new global platform for collaboration
1635705 never before in the history of the planet have so many people on their own had the ability to find so much information about so many things and about so many other people
1635706 loewe ist es in den ersten sechs monaten 2008 sehr erfolgreich gelungen sich dem allgemeinen markttrend r ckl ufiger preise weitestgehend zu entziehen und damit die profitabilit t des unternehmens kontinuierlich zu verbessern
1635707 in deutschland sind die menschen zunehmend offener f r neue techniken
1635708 aus heutiger sicht ist aber davon auszugehen dass sich die generell etwas schw cheren sommermonate juli und august sowie die ver nderte saisonale durch die fu ball em auf das dritte quartal 2008 d mpfend auswirken k nnten
1635709 f r das gesamtjahr 2008 rechnet loewe deshalb weiterhin mit einem umsatzwachstum von sieben prozent auf rund 400 mio euro und einer ergebnisverbesserung beim ebit von 14 prozent auf circa 24 mio euro
1635710 wir wollen immer unsere ziele bererf llen sehr wahrscheinlich erreichen wir mehr

1635723 the president wanted to get an explanation as to why we needed more money for fuel
1635724 it was not easy to convince the president because dr suruma had already written to him that our demand will affect the budget performance but we explained to him and he understood our concerns
1635725 do not do unto others what you do not want them to do unto you
1635726 do not do unto others what you do not want them to do unto you
1635727 das berlegen sich einige jugendliche schon und wenn nur ein teil von dem vermittelten h ngen bleibt ist ja schon etwas gewonnen
1635728 spieler und zuschauer m ssen lernen dass der verband die gewalt nicht hinnimmt sondern etwas tut
1635729 aber beleidigungen will ich auf dem spielfeld nicht h ren
1635730 bei den j ngeren spielern sind es meist die eltern die den streit anfangen
1635731 die lteren jugendlichen hingegen begr en sich auf dem spielfeld schon mal mit hurensohn das geht zu weit da greife ich schon ein
1635732 mit lehrern und trainern und nach dem abpfiff geht es dann gleich wieder nach hause
1635733 wenn mir etwas auf dem spielfeld oder am rand auff llt wende ich mich an die betreuer der mannschaft
1635734 messer in rucks cken und gewaltvideos auf handys waren an der tagesordnung
1635735 wer als lehrer an der hauptschule berlebt der hat f rs leben gewonnen
1635736 der alkohol macht mutig und enthemmt und am ende geht es dann rund
1635737 sie sollen schlie lich vorbild f r die jungs sein
1635738 ich habe sogar schon mal einen jungen erlebt der sich nicht vom spielfeld runter getraut hat weil sein vater am rand herumtobte oft wollen die eltern dass ihre kinder das erreichen was sie selbst nicht geschafft haben

1635741 i am an alien from outter space i am a cybergirl without a face
1635742 the walking festival has come a very long way in the ten years we have been holding it it has grown from a festival with just 39 walks to what is now the biggest event of its type in the uk
1635743 it has become a tremendous means of attracting new visitors and has also brought us plenty of national publicity which is fantastic for the island
1635744 it is particularly pleasing that the october celebration weekend will bring visitors to the island outside the traditional holiday season
1635745 it is important that we seek to promote the island as a year round destination and great events such as the weekend walking festival help us to do that
1635746 i do not feel intimidated and challenged i will rise to the occasion in line with the objectives of the organisation i have been exposed to challenging positions before
1635747 lauren has played a vital role in taking the simba brands to where they are today she has a passion for her country a deep understanding of the south african consumer and a true understanding of the value of brand equity for any company
1635748 with 18 years experience in the fmcg environment she is sure to successfully maintain simbas strong position and lead the simba brands to even greater success
1635749 hard smart and ensuring that work life balance is maintained
1635750 we feel that not enough has been done to publicise the law particularly in rural areas
1635751 some of our police officers are still not equipped with the necessary skills in handling domestic violence cases especially in relation with the law
1635752 the form required is 30 pages long and is too complicated for a physically and emotionally abused person to complete
1635753 also the economic challenges we are currently facing make it very difficult for one to make a copy of the form
1635754 we therefore urge the government to make these forms available and take necessary measures in the implementation of the law
1635755 shelters that are made available for victims need to be protected for example in rural areas these shelters are located at the headmans homestead which is public knowledge to everyone including the perpetrators
1635756 as of now a total of 800 were sent subpoenas since the task force was created two years ago
1635757 some even tampered tickets which they presented later on we may also file charges of perjury or falsification of public documents against them
1635758 many cases were not random but were actually based on tips provided by neighbors and other concerned citizens
1635759 kung maari po sana ay iwasan muna nating bumiyahe kung gabi
1635760 hinihingi ko kay pangulong arroyo na sibakin na si general hermogenes esperon bilang presidential adviser on the peace process iyon ang abiso sa kanya i am asking president arroyo to sack general hermogenes esperon as presidential adviser on the peace process thats my advice to her
1635761 this agreement is wrong to begin with dahilan sa na partition nga ang ating bansa hinihiwalay niya ang isang bahagi ng ating bansa mula doon sa iba bibigyan sila ng kapangyarihan over their natural resources over their citizens over political and economic elements of the bangsamoro juridical entity na hiwalay doon sa republika ng pilipinas
1635762 this agreement is wrong to begin with because it creates partitions in our country
1635763 itong kasunduan na ito ay hindi nauunawaan ng ating mga kababayan nakita natin sa proseso na kulang sa konsultasyon at wala halos ang nakakaalam sa nilalaman nitong kasunduang ito ito ay pruweba sa maling stratehiya
1635764 many of our countrymen have no idea what this agreement was all about
1635765 if it ever comes to amendments of the armm charter i will be against it because it partitions our country
1635766 the initialing does not make the moa self executory that is why malaysia went to the extent of organizing a big program for this so much so that we have several distinguished ambassadors based in the philippines going to malaysia
1635767 the moa is violative of the provisions in the constitution the definition of ancestral domain alone is very encompassing
1635768 it faces very serious constitutional questions and constraints based on the text it looks like we are creating an independent state within the republic of the philippines
1635769 anyway it has not been signed so theres nothing to scrap the supreme court tro is for the parties not to sign the document
1635770 i dont discount the possibility of an investigation thats part of the oversight functions of congress
1635771 practiced extra liberality in defining the parameters of the moa
1635772 i dont want to impute malice i want to give them the benefit of the doubt it might have been a genuine desire to address the peace problems in mindanao but the problem is that they overextended it
1635773 it seems that utmost secrecy is the game this government wants to play
1635774 we are not blaming the milf they got what they wanted it seems the fault is with the government
1635775 para rin itong nbn deal ang tongpats dito ay iyung cha cha charter change
1635776 i am calling for a full discussion on the merits of the moa i think transparency should always be observed
1635777 there is nothing unconstitutional about it the peace talks are pursuing the mandate of the constitution to include provinces municipalities cities and geographical units which may opt to join a plebiscite for the purpose muslim autonomy
1635778 lets call for calm and sobriety anger and obfuscation wont solve the peace in mindanao now
1635779 it doesnt mean that because the signing of the pact has been temporarily suspended we have already begun the countdown to war no if the moa will hit a legal snag then it would be back to the negotiating table and not off to war
1635780 it will take only one man out of 20 million mindanaoans to create mayhem
1635781 iran already stopped nuclear enrichment at the behest of europe for more than a year a reference to tehrans suspension of enrichment between late 2003 and mid 2005 to allow negotiations with the european union and what happened nothing
1635782 to place a verifiable cap on iranian enrichment and other nuclear capabilities well short of weaponization
1635783 the americans when they need the npt they talk about it when they dont need it they throw it away you dont do that with an international treaty
1635784 no evidence that iran was working actively to build nuclear weapons
1635785 with the shah we also came to the conclusion that iran was in great need of nuclear energy because our population was steadily growing and our gas and oil will run out thats why even though i was in the old regime i should be fair to the new regime because they are following the same line to speak frankly with its bellicose behavior the west is pushing iran towards nuclear weapons even if they dont want them now
1635786 the europeans say stop enrichment and well talk but the iranians already did that and nothing happened
1635787 at the time of the shah we signed contracts with both france and germany and even then they didnt deliver if i were in the current regime i wouldnt trust the west they dont even give iran civilian airplane parts which is costing hundreds of lives why should they believe that they will give them enriched uranium
1635788 for years now they are threatening us with an attack
1635789 these guys are ants when the time comes you crush them
1635790 because women have lower immunity during pregnancy cases of hepatitis e are severe and cause more death among them
1635791 this is double mortality because not only are the mothers dying but their unborn children too we all need to play an active role to contain the situation
1635792 fulminate hepatitis occurs more frequently in pregnancy and regularly induces a mortality rate of 20 percent among pregnant women in the third trimester
1635793 the major challenges are inadequate access to safe water unhygienic disposal of faeces poor personal and domestic hygiene
1635794 he has more money but ten years from now that could be me trampled on by the courts its not fair
1635795 we can work together on common problems as we have always done but we dont need to sign that there is danger that the public may misinterpret it
1635796 we shall not sign any document which would be a death warrant for this party parties can create an electoral alliance because its allowed by the law but not such simple things
1635797 i hope they dp will join us they are still checking themselves and cross checking with their executive members but importantly they will join us
1635798 damn baby i know things didnt work out between us but i did not know you cried for 3 days and then you ate a kashi bar clearly i have done you wrong and for that i am sorry
1635799 since day one farmind has been going strong on the handhelds with great success we did the first finnish psp and ds games and since founding farmind weve worked on four different handheld games we want to keep it that way but in addition to handheld consoles were moving on to wii as well
1635800 the bluefluid surf racks are simple and quick to fit i had the racks and boards on the car in 5 minutes they worked perfectly on the weekend to carry 3 boards on our 2 door car we are about one and a half hours from the beach and most of that is freeway driving the boards stayed right where they should at 100km h
1635801 we are operating business as usual at walk am and fm stations there is no change in our day to day operations while we are in the aloha trust we will continue to stay focused on the task at hand which remains as always to super serve our listeners clients and employees
1635802 to increase the fees by 700 percent is too drastic of an increase
1635803 its going to impact a lot of local contractors who get their licenses from suffolk county many of these people are self employed and cant afford it
1635804 we kept improving our background procedure without raising the fee that goes along with it
1635805 long standing efforts to promote internet safety and appropriate behavior online
1635806 child pornography has no place on the internet or in our society
1635807 it does take a long time to go through a foreclosure process already in new york but what were finding when we do workout packages with the servicers is they havent been as motivated in some instances as they can be
1635808 they are overwhelmed with the amount of requests that are coming their way and they havent completely been able to staff up and they dont have the full capacity to respond so oftentimes we are sending packages two or three times to the servicer
1635809 labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress
1635810 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1635811 to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1635812 this is not an economy hungering for lower interest rates
1635813 the fed doesnt need to lower interest rates the fed needs to act to restore confidence and liquidity in all the credit markets
1635814 weve seen this continued deterioration of price in response to lower demand
1635815 and in four weeks its labor day and the peak summer travel season is over
1635816 plus theres been ample supply for our needs and we continue to receive imports
1635817 i dont remember any other host cities having such areas of protests
1635818 if the olympics are successful the perception of political risk will continue to be lowered even more
1635819 foreigners will be interested in moving more money or setting up in china
1635820 if the news is more positive than negative about china during the games it will help lift chinas overall image and promote tourism for china
1635821 many of our raw materials are the type that would be affected by these environmental cleanup measures
1635822 everybody is saying that the situation would be better after the games
1635823 beijing is increasingly fearful that growth will slow to a level which will not create sufficient new jobs to fuel the rapid rise in living standards
1635824 in china theres no such top sports clubs or famous leagues like the nba or british soccer that can rent these sites and support their frequent use

1635831 una de las m s fuertes en cuanto a recepci n de cruceros
1635832 es uno de los principales mercados emisores para valencia rivalizando con italia en torno al primer puesto
1635833 en lo que va de a o los datos reflejan que este mercado a pesar de la coyuntura mundial se mantiene con cifras cercanas a las registradas en 2007
1635834 hace prever que el a o se saldar con 174 escalas y 201 000 cruceristas
1635835 ya se duplicaron las escalas con respecto a 2006 pasando de 80 a 155
1635836 estos datos y la llegada de nuevos buques demuestran que la ciudad es cada vez m s demandada por las grandes compa as crucer sticas
1635837 a pesar de esta consolidaci n de la imagen de la ciudad como escala la fundaci n contin a trabajando en la captaci n de nuevas compa as armadoras u operadores de este segmento para que valencia se afiance como un destino tur stico de primer nivel en el sector de cruceros

1635840 i used to but i gave up after i had children as i didnt want them around that sort of language
1635841 then i realised if i could do it when they were there then i could do it when they werent there either
1635842 i guess its similar to giving up smoking its just will power i would never ever swear at a referee in any case its hard when you get frustrated because a decision hasnt gone your way but there is never any excuse for swearing
1635843 overly competitive parents can be a real issue weve combated this at harefield by consigning them to an area 20 yards away from the touchline on the opposite side from the coaching staff
1635844 sometimes parents forget why children are playing football because their only exposure to football is what theyve seen on tv or when theyve paid 30 to watch a live match
1635845 they forget that their children are actually part of a learning environment where they will frequently make mistakes as they experiment with new skills
1635846 mistakes are all part of learning nobody ever rode a bike the first time and parents need to remember this
1635847 the added pressure of parents shouting and giving complex instructions can often hinder a childs football development and take the enjoyment out of the game
1635848 we have a series of signs around our home venues reminding parents of exactly what were trying to achieve here
1635849 i know how important it is for young players to feel they are wearing the best kit when running out on the pitch
1635850 the junior kit scheme is a great opportunity to get free kits from the football foundation which i wear in the premier league
1635851 after winning the fa premier league cup last season all the players and staff at everton are understandably really excited about the new campaign
1635852 itd be great if we can win the womens community shield begin the season with some silverware and start as we mean to go on
1635853 jack was given the opportunity by the manager to go on the austrian training camp along with five others who have all done really well jack has taken his chance and he is one of quite a few we have here that we have high hopes for
1635854 samir is a very good player and we are lucky to have signed him i have played alongside him in the french national team i believe he will show everyone he can play very well and will find his place in the arsenal team
1635855 our goal is to offer the best customer service and the widest range of pop culture items on ebay at down to earth prices
1635856 with the delta announcement you really hit the tipping point
1635857 but you do not want to get on the plane and decide thats where youre going to download the digital version of gone with the wind
1635858 i feel pretty strongly about people not using their mobile phones on planes because you know what its like even on the train
1635859 theres nothing wrong with getting more work done on a flight
1635860 boston to california or chicago to a huge amount of time where you could be really productive just learn how to shut down for dinner or for an hour
1635861 ive got more than enough to keep me busy anyway
1635862 we got delayed and sat on a runway for the entire super bowl
1635863 it wasnt extraordinarily fast but it was quite adequate and it was a good service
1635864 we are so connected between blackberries and everything else that anxiety sets in for a lot of people
1635865 theyre afraid not to be connected theyre afraid of what they might miss for an hour an hour and a half im fine two or three hours i dont know
1635866 con entusiasmo esfuerzo y gran capacidad de trabajo se ha logrado que el festival se celebre con un important simo reparto
1635867 we have four major grand slams in a year for other athletes here it is almost do or die we will give it all we have got but in two weeks time there is the u s open
1635868 the medal was the biggest highlight of my career and i feel a bit of a veteran here we play as individuals most of the year and so it is a huge highlight to be in a team and feel that team spirit
1635869 after wimbledon i didnt give myself a lot of chance of playing here or at the u s open
1635870 i had a week and a half of hitting in sydney and took it day to day i wasnt going to commit until i was sure that it wouldnt flare up
1635871 not being seeded a lot depends on the draw i consider myself one of the most dangerous floaters if i get through one or two matches i will just get better
1635872 the doctors thought i was going to die in two days
1635873 then they thought id never be able to fly again on a plane just to be here i feel like i won a big match already
1635874 it wasnt something i was doing for performance enhancement it was something i needed to do to stay alive
1635875 in athens i thought losing two medals was the worst thing that couldve happened to my life
1635876 i would much rather trade all my athletic accomplishments to spend one hour with either of my parents again
1635877 but he came through it an decided to try one more time
1635878 he was born in china he died in china he helped the chinese people and he had a great love for china it really was his frame of reference in his life
1635879 these things endear him to the chinese even though in principle there is a hesitancy about making a hero of someone who was a christian missionary
1635880 it would be very difficult for an eric liddell type to do more than potter around these days because of the devotion required to compete
1635881 they suffered a great deal of deprivation at weifeng he must have deteriorated a great deal there but what was the cause of the brain tumour that eventually caused his death is another matter
1635882 the position of sport has changed so much it has become almost a new religion a form of idolatry
1635883 that was our worst effort i wouldnt say effort our worst performance
1635884 i dont think we were sharp or played to the level we can play
1635885 busc fortalecer la sede apost lica la paz y la unidad entre los pr ncipes cristianos

1635887 our life is all about weightlifting we eat sleep drink everything is just weightlifting
1635888 life is a bit hard were a bit blocked in but if we discipline ourselves we get results
1635889 youd go around the island and youd see young kids with broomsticks lifting that opened the door for the other countries
1635890 the wealth destroyed by taxation is not what government gets that part just gets redistributed it is the net loss of wealth that happens because of taxation
1635891 that means apart from redistribution there is a net loss to the society
1635892 you guys should look for life beyond the net the weather is so lovely outside
1635893 oh that is because he has none haha i am so great compared to him
1635894 wealth being destroyed is possible only if money is burnt
1635895 dead weight losses are the losses to the cigarette manufacturers not to the economy as a whole

1635902 this survey highlights that some sectors of the housing market are experiencing appreciable rates of price decline though the overall picture when balanced out suggests that there has only been a 4 reduction but the main impact on the market is in the volume of transactions which have been more than halved over the year
1635903 while a correction in the market is taking place it is important to stress that price levels have not collapsed and the marking down of prices appears to be incremental rather than a one off correction
1635904 the survey shows that price changes vary widely across different parts of northern ireland and across the types of properties so people should be cautious about making over simplistic judgments for instance there are different factors affecting both the resale and the new build markets
1635905 there is no precedent in this region for what is happening in terms of a genuine housing cycle so we are on a journey through the unknown which itself is feeding the uncertainty however with a very quiet resale market i believe there is a high probability of the average price dropping closer to the 200 000 level before the end of year with a period of adjustment stretching into 2009 anyone looking for the green shoots of recovery should keep an eye on transaction levels which are likely turn before prices do but it might be a while
1635906 there is no doubt that northern irelands housing market is facing a challenging time but at the same time the current situation provides government with an opportunity to accelerate the building of social and affordable homes thereby helping both developers by providing them with guaranteed cash flow and the many households waiting to access a social dwelling or purchase their first home

1635908 i hope we meet in the gold medal game then well see
1635909 being the favourite team doesnt necessarily mean you win gold
1635910 there are several big teams in the competition such as argentina or greece and especially the united states is very strong this year
1635911 even though we came here to win the gold medal we have to start from the very beginning we will have time to speak about the united states when we face them in the first round
1635912 once we are in the quarter finals we will begin to make plans we must demonstrate to everyone why we came here as the favourites
1635913 families still want to eat out but clearly they have a less money in their pockets and are searching for value

1635918 what i show to the general public is obviously the positive side but like you say i am human and this has been a roller coaster ride this isnt flu this is cancer
1635919 how do i keep focused its been pretty easy actually
1635920 a lot of times you can get to events like this like the olympic games and you can put maybe too much pressure on yourself and ive kind of got an out with cancer in that cancers put things in perspective for me
1635921 theres a lot more to life than the olympic games and i think having learned that lesson really quickly has kind of helped keep this whole thing in perspective for me
1635922 hes the guy that i looked to before i even came down with the diagnosis what he did after he was diagnosed and being treated for it you cant help being inspired by that
1635923 and also to know that i will be cured and i will beat this is a pretty inspiring thought too and its not going to control my life
1635924 they help me through the down days it cancer is on my mind constantly i cant help that thats how its got to be
1635925 but with the support i have the people i have in my corner theyre the ones who help me through it
1635926 the way hes handled it has put everything else in perspective for all of us

1635929 under such circumstances you draw the taser and explain what is going to happen if you have time sometimes you dont
1635930 you say im going to take this out and if you dont do what youre being told youre going to get 50 000 volts through you
1635931 theres a red dot site and that will be pointed at the persons chest and in most cases thats enough to stop them
1635932 in this instance the indication is that there has been damage to an improvement scheme put in at great cost a few years ago to intercept water and clean up seaham beach and harbour

1635934 after 100 days boris johnson has yet to show how he will keep his promise to make london the worlds greenest capital
1635935 he has made progress in some areas but this has been undermined by transport policies that will lead to more traffic more flights and more climate changing carbon dioxide emissions

1635943 this years fun and feedback event was a huge success there were plenty of activities and it was really well attended by people who gave us some valuable feedback on our services
1635944 as well as the most popular activities from previous years we also had a story corner a free book stall and a childrens story competition
1635945 other activities included a magician balloon modelling bingo flower arranging community art and a human fly game that involved velcro outfits a trampoline and a velcro wall
1635946 for the very first time im able to create superheroes in the fantastic japanese manga style thanks to my lucky partnership with the great hiroyuki takei what a kick itll be to join hiroyuki san in offering brand new action packed stories to an army of readers in both the eastern and western worlds
1635947 word of ultimos development and subsequent debut in japan led many domestic fans to wonder when they would get a chance to read it so were very excited to offer the north american debut in the upcoming september issue of shonen jump
1635948 ultimo was developed as a true collaboration with stan lee sending his initial story idea to takei san who developed artwork and characters and reworked the plot to fit into the japanese manga storytelling style the result is something extremely compelling and we invite everyone to check out this historic release in our upcoming issue
1635949 since we first hosted the original test model of the a380 and one of the first demonstration models last year los angeles has eagerly awaited the a380s entry into commercial service
1635950 we see emirates service as the foundation of the next page of commercial aviation
1635951 the arrival of this magnificent aircraft is a persuasive reminder that the future is very much at hand
1635952 we focused on the comfort of the passengers with lots of space between the seats
1635953 we remain unshakable in our belief that this is the aircraft for the next chapter of aviation
1635954 as we get more of these aircraft and its performance improves and the demand from passengers allows us to build a market we will bring this aircraft into los angeles
1635955 but the most important reason is that no u s airline can afford this expensive plane they just dont have the money to buy them right now
1635956 the domestic airlines that do offer long haul flights seem to be happy with the boeing 777 planes they have in service
1635957 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets

1635960 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next steps before i get in front of them
1635961 we dont have the decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1635962 these two races here feel like im on a mediterranean holiday because the stress and strains of an oval track for me where i feel like i havent quite mastered the trade where here on a road course i feel comfortable in my surroundings i know that if i do my job as i should that we should have a decent day
1635963 well thats right but i know road racing and i have a confidence in myself that i should do okay if i could just do what i do well its nice to have that feeling of security going into qualifying its a pressure deal you only get one lap in the cup deal but its as easy as its going to get when youre trying to do it the way were doing it
1635964 it feels good i enjoy it for the experience i like watkins glen its a good fun place to be hopefully the weekend goes well
1635965 its just a flowing track its got a lot of history to it its known as one of americas finest race tracks as far as road racing goes its got a lot of character the corners have good banking on most of them the track is in a beautiful location in america its just a nice place to be the fans by the looks of it they have a history of going there they really know what theyre doing when the get there and who theyre following theyre fairly well educated fans too watkins glen is a unique race track and the people go there to watch road racing which is nice too
1635966 at watkins glen youve got to have a really good car to make it work i feel like car handling plays more a part of watkins glen than it does at canada or mexico just because its a handling style race track
1635967 so brakes arent an issue there at watkins glen its not as technical it just really comes down to really being able to run the high speed corners without getting yourself in trouble and carrying momentum
1635968 its a handling race track i think the fastest car will probably win the race where as in canada and mexico sometimes its not the case strategy comes more into play at those other two venues
1635969 oh yeah youre loose all the time youve got to set them up loose to be able to run its no different from oval racing to road course racing youve got to let the car do the work for you if youre putting a steering wheel into it its not as fast its easy to make the car too loose for sure
1635970 each corner is unique and different youve just got to get a balance out of the whole lap some corners youre going to be tight even when you complain about being loose there are some corners that youre still not going to have enough front grip on
1635971 its a compromise on how you want it its a very personal thing setting up a road course what some drivers call loose someone else might call balanced its different driving style and how you want go about it
1635972 yeah i try to drift the car as much as i can
1635973 no it plays no part really what you gain in draft you loose by being conservative on the brakes trying to stay off of them its not going to come into play
1635974 he was charming witty and fantastic he was everything to me he was my world
1635975 i have got two nine year old boy and girl twins frankie and jordan and he was perfect with them
1635976 he was a lovely person and i had every confidence that he would become world champion
1635977 he was the most genuine honest appreciative person i have ever met in my life
1635978 we love him and he will be greatly missed he had so many friends in peterborough he was an instantly likeable lad
1635979 i hated him racing when he crashed in 2001 i never wanted him to race again
1635980 but he said to me mum you might as well cut off my arms and legs if you say i cant race
1635981 it was what he loved he died doing what he loved best we do take comfort from that
1635982 he told me if i die racing i will die happy
1635983 he was a good racer but to me he was just craig he was lovely and caring and would give you anything
1635984 he put more into 10 to 12 years of racing than people do in their life time
1635985 i am so desperately sad that craig died from the injuries he sustained at brands hatch
1635986 britain has lost a wonderful rider who i admired enormously and had every chance of being a future world champion
1635987 it is fitting that the abiding memory so many of us will have of craig was him riding brilliantly battling for the lead of an incredible race in front of his home crowd
1635988 the voices faces and forms that vanished in the hell

1635990 children who evacuated buildings or went to work at factories on that day have not returned 63 years on the atomic bomb deprived them of normal life
1635991 we have been extremely fortunate regarding the achievements our technical staff and racing drivers have delivered in such a short time the support we have continuously received from porsche has played no small part in our success and we look forward to building and developing our relationship further
1635992 however at farnbacher loles we place the greatest emphasis on the efficiency of our operating systems and processes whether it be in an administrative or technical capacity with the help of our talented associates we design and redesign our operation to acheive the highest possible level of quality for our customers on and off the race track results in racing are frequently determined by factors outside of our control we are punted off or have an unlucky yellow and lose a lap and so we aim to maximize our advantage in the factors we can control with meticulous preparation and organization
1635993 ive enjoyed racing at road america in past years its a high speed circuit which makes it good for drafting with some technical hair raising segments as well
1635994 i am excited to share the drive with my two friends rick and dirk they have been part of what has been an impressive debut season for farnbacher loles racings one car effort in alms they have shown good speed in the car the team has deserved victories in the last couple of races so im hoping its only a matter of time to achieve a winning result
1635995 ive watched youtube in car cameras but the best thing will be to walk the track i think the track is very challenging it seems to be fast and its the right circuit for the porsche we drive im sure we have a good shot at the podium again like the last races horst farnbacher team owner and technical director will make the car fast then we just have to drive it
1635996 our offer is clear and their response is not clear
1635997 the iranian government needs to respond in a very clear way to the generous offer from the international community
1635998 as predicted it basically says yes we will give you an answer but when you give us an answer
1635999 people get very excited about their causes and lack the sense to see if the information backs them up
1636000 you dont see their bodies going blotchily red and hear them howling like a banshee
1636001 if i lift my kilt on bourbon street im much more likely to get arrested than if elizabeth takes off her top

1636003 this has been the iranian strategy for years to bide their time and continue with their enrichment
1636004 im here to shop the summer sales at charlotte russe i wont be buying fall clothes until september
1636005 i just realized in this day and time it wasnt essential
1636006 im looking at my bills everything is so much more expensive and i already have one
1636007 but i love shoes i love purses and i love makeup and who knows maybe ill catch something at the preseason sale
1636008 i have information that he will be charged for sodomy tomorrow
1636009 at this moment anwar has the upper hand in the campaign as everyone expect him to win but the barisan ruling coalition strategy is to throw as much dirt as possible during the campaign so that even if he wins he will win with some tainted allegations
1636010 we believe that a transition of sorts has begun in malaysia but it is unclear how quickly things will change or even the degree of change that will take place

1636013 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1636014 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1636015 the wording is a little strong over inflation but theres really no real change in policy
1636016 i think they are trying to buy time to allow the economy to recover and so that the financials can slowly repair
1636017 i think the fed would rather wait until after the election before they consider raising rates
1636018 that will give them time to get a better view of the economy and see if financial markets have become less fragile
1636019 seem more concerned about growth for the rest of this year
1636020 sony has been an excellent partner and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential
1636021 so whats the state supposed to do just wait till he goes out and does it again
1636022 it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense
1636023 by your logic private citizens should be allowed to own nuclear weapons
1636024 weapons which may be deemed to be excessively injurious or to have indiscriminate effects
1636025 the main problem will be the fact everyone has to stay indoors
1636026 hes in good standing with nascar thats all they told us and thats all we need to know
1636027 thats the point it theyre dropped theyre not an issue
1636028 well its our one year anniversary since crew chief todd okuhara took over the helm of the mopar oakley dodge team
1636029 and were excited about that the brainerd race was todds first race with us last year we made it to the semifinals and had a real good shot at winning the race
1636030 getting into the countdown would be great but weve had a lot of fumbles this year weve had some chances to make some moves and nothing happened so were just going to do all we need to do and try to execute if it works great if it doesnt then its not meant to be
1636031 were going into brainerd with no pressure hopefully todd will make the right calls i will do my job driving and i know the mopar oakley dodge crew is always on top of things i dont worry about them at all well just see what happens
1636032 the fans save up all year to come to this event and to see us race
1636033 the suzuki im riding set the track record there last year 6 959 seconds by angelle sampey so maybe we can go out there and break the track record this year and get another win wed love to keep our momentum going
1636034 its very important to keep tuning on the truck race after race the deaver spring and bilstein shock combination has really got this truck racing on rails the support we get from trail ready beadlocks really let us use all the tire goodyear gives us we can vary the tire pressure more and run tight with other competitors when its needed thanks to trail ready the abuse these limited suspension trucks take is incredible the constant pounding on and off the throttle constantly yet our motive gear ring and pinion gets our horsepower to the ground this class usually doesnt get much monetary support from sponsors most of our support comes in the way of product support and contingency offers from companies believe you me it is really appreciated
1636035 we still need to push very hard in the development of the car and the reliability but even
1636036 i have to say that we are very sad for felipe because in my view he drove the best race of his career
1636037 it was fantastic the way that he attacked when he had to attack he managed the race right up to the final laps so we are very disappointed
1636038 unfortunately we had no warning we just had the smoke in front of us and it was very bad
1636039 unfortunately there was no signal no information no warning on the telemetry
1636040 if you are mentally able to manage this kind of race after such a big disappointment you have to take a step forward because you get stronger this is what we are all going to do together because thats the way we are going to approach the next race in valencia
1636041 the short race at watkins glen is a bigger challenge than most would expect it is one of the fastest tracks we run on and one of the shortest races we run it also requires a little different setup than other courses the corners are straight forward and very fast a properly setup car is a must for this race since it is a dp race only with no gt cars you should see several different strategies used by teams that will make it a very interesting race
1636042 this is a tough time for the crew we left the track at montr al late on friday night drove to watkins glen moved in on monday and started the prep for fridays race what makes it tough is the time away from home the late hours and the downtime the crew will be gone from home for one and half weeks including two weekends we will do everything but race on thursday and then sit around all day friday until our race that evening we will then work until after midnight packing everything up to exit the track by 2 00 am it is hard work both mentally and physically it takes a lot out of the crew
1636043 returning to the glen for a second time this season allows me to personally be up to speed more quickly ill know immediately what im looking for out of the car and can concentrate solely on setup as opposed to track familiarization and setup so in effect that gives me increased confidence that we can spend more time perfecting our race car
1636044 every race brings a new opportunity and this coming weekend is no different while weve had i feel that our team is much more capable than that the benefit of this course is that i think that the faster flowing turns as opposed to tighter slower ones will complement our engine package having the race be comprised strictly of dps should also play to our advantage thus i believe we could be prime for a season best result
1636045 i find the long course is more challenging but the short course is faster so do i particularly like one of the configurations over the other no not really i generally like faster tracks over slower ones frankly ill like the one that will give us our best performance since the short course provides us a dp only race ill probably favor that aspect over anything else
1636046 i love watkins glen as a driver how can you not like the glen we have had some really good runs the last few races some of it has been good strategy some of it has been skill behind the wheel and some has been just a little luck but at the end of the day you make your own luck you really do as a team we work very hard to get everything out of what we have that is why i love sports car racing all of those things have a role and that is what makes the sport so unique i think watkins glen can be the next step in this team moving forward
1636047 it is even more important that we focus on getting a really good race car because of the configuration results are more car dependant than driver dependant on the short course if you are just a little off on the short course then you are going to be way off the pace
1636048 as a driver i am always looking forward to the next event i would race seven days a week if i could what i am really impressed with is the crew they work so hard to get this car from race to race there isnt even a full week in between these two events fortunately we left canada without too many scratches on the southard car that will make it easier on the guys but it is still a lot of effort to turn it around there is a lot of work that goes into this and i really salute the southard crew for all they do to give me a great car week in and week out
1636049 all our investigations which are facts based are carried out without fear or favour and in a transparent manner regardless of the persons status and our arrest track record speaks for itself
1636050 this is actually an offence under the anti corruption act
1636051 action can be taken against the complainant if the report is not true or made with malice we will not hesitate to charge the person in court
1636052 the most provocative sound to a wolf is a crying baby or a laughing baby
1636053 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1636054 the family would like to stay involved in the business
1636055 they can be up and running in less than a week they have people on hold all across the country
1636056 the first couple of weeks is when they will try to make the major money when people are flocking in and thats when theres a lot of inventory and a lot of selection
1636057 there will be big gigantic signs to lure you in but the sales are usually not as good as they appear particularly at the beginning
1636058 and shoddy merchandise can be brought in later to support the sale so its consumer beware
1636059 because you wont have boscovs to take it back to
1636060 you need to know whether its a good deal its not necessarily that it is
1636061 the liquidator is going to put a price on it but it might not be cheaper than anybody elses
1636062 a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than a few months
1636063 theres no way the economy is not in recession with retail sales down with durable goods down with payrolls down
1636064 we really try to stick to the science and not think about the politics
1636065 ive never been aware of any politically motivated views within the committee to change the timing of our work
1636066 we get reported on page c 12 of the wall street journal
1636067 innovation is what will differentiate the winners and the losers in our industry and in the current environment
1636068 innovation drives consumer value and builds brand equity and trust over time
1636069 bottom line p amp g is managing through cost pressures businesses remain healthy and we would continue to be buyers
1636070 this funding opens the door to a better way of life for hundreds of people with learning disabilities who will now be able to integrate into communities across the country while given high quality support to lead a full life as equal citizens
1636071 we are providing funding for both pcts and local authorities to help close inappropriate nhs accommodation and to support people with learning disabilities make the transition to the community a smooth one i am proud that government has been able to help make it happen
1636072 it will enable many more people to live in their own homes in local communities supported to get good health care more choice employment and volunteering opportunities and social and leisure activities will all come from this new development
1636073 i have always thought that the congestion charge is a blunt instrument it has proved successful in cutting traffic coming into london but on its own has not resolved the problem of congestion various works and schemes going on in the capital have also eroded its impact
1636074 i am therefore introducing a more comprehensive approach to easing congestion in london one that gives greater consideration to how all transport measures impact on the movement of traffic on our roads
1636075 without the congestion charge the traffic problems in london would be much worse however as a result of other interventions such as utility and construction works the reduction in road space has had a detrimental impact on congestion levels and is slowing traffic down
1636076 the percentage of homicides committed with a firearm continued a declining trend since 1969
1636077 robberies with a firearm rose by 34 1 per cent across the state
1636078 association of rates of household handgun ownership lifetime major depression and serious suicidal thoughts with rates of suicide across us census regions
1636079 emphasis mine one may reasonably demand evidence that keeping a handgun results in a
1636080 more likely to be murdered with a handgun than to use a handgun to kill in self defense
1636081 oh the little ladies god bless em they couldnt possibly learn how to wield a handgun effectively the big nasty man would just take it away from them
1636082 criminals are humans too and its society that is to blame
1636083 the state should not lower itself to murder on our behalf
1636084 we cant guarantee we wont execute the wrong guy sometimes

1636089 i thought going into the last six races that we were going to win 10 or 11 rounds to have a shot at staying in the top 10
1636090 weve won five rounds so far in the last three races i still am kind of sticking to that concept i think were going to need a minimum of 10 round wins
1636091 i think if we can win brainerd well put ourselves in pretty good shape to stay in the top 10
1636092 maybe even more important we won the second race of the year and then we went into a slump for seven or eight races it seems like were coming out of that slump but the reality is youre never out of a slump until you win a race
1636093 if we can stay in the countdown i think it would send a message to all the guys who have been busting their butts on the valvoline mts dodge team that we really can contend for this championship were legitimate were here and there isnt any reason that we cant be mixing it up to be no
1636094 but i really think that were going to need to win one of these next three and id just as soon do it in brainerd and get it over with and then we can work on the other two
1636095 im really looking forward to the glen because we had a great test there earlier this season and its just a track that i love racing on
1636096 montreal was a good example of just how competitive it is in this series we had a fast car as weve had all along since we introduced the dallara and a problem set us back and sent us home in sixth place it was an exciting race a lot went on out there from beginning to end im sure anyone who saw it is a bigger fan of grand am racing than ever unfortunately we werent racing for the win there at the end fortunately we are going to watkins glen this week where we have had some of our best days
1636097 we will be there were very excited we believe the car will perform well mechanically the cars very good from this point on its about learning about the car and trying to figure out its aerodynamic package were not dealing with the traffic with the gt cars so we think its a great race to debut the car we will be attending utah and then getting everything ready to get running next year starting off with the rolex 24 at daytona
1636098 we would love to get it at the glen thats where bob snodgrass grew up and he was always excited to go back there the glen would be a great place to do it weve got two cars in the top five in the team points were knocking on the door the glen would be a great place to win
1636099 we have been in a position to win a lot of races and things just arent going our way but we have got pace and we are doing the right things but we just have things going wrong and that cant last forever i want to start building momentum and carry it through the end of the season straight into daytona next year thats kind of where i am setting my sights right now
1636100 we think we can give the ganassi guys a hard time the last four races we arrive at the track every weekend thinking were going to win weve won a lot at the glen and weve been on the podium a bunch of times we love it there last years race was pretty crazy it came down to the last lap and we won in a good battle with max angelelli and colin braun
1636101 after over 40 years of success in investing in affordable housing and regulating the housing association sector this is our last corporate plan
1636102 we will be focused on achieving the successful transfer of our functions to the homes and communities agency and tenant services authority
1636103 at the same time we will ensure that we continue our record of achievement of delivering our core objectives
1636104 the weathers been disappointing this year but we never realised our true potential either
1636105 we had high hopes but for whatever reason we never really got going
1636106 i suffer from asthma and im having to take supplements to protect my lung lining
1636107 our competition lasts 6 8 hours a day for a whole week so the build up could have a bearing
1636108 theres pollution in any huge city but i think were more sceptical about beijing as were not perhaps getting the full picture from the authorities
1636109 i am hugely excited that rosie boycott has agreed to chair the london food board and champion the provision of high quality nutritious food in the capital
1636110 rosie is as passionate as i am about the importance of locally produced affordable food to our health and well being as well as the role food can play in protecting our environment
1636111 with rising fuel and food prices it is common sense that we look again at the role food can have in improving our quality of life and in protecting our environment now and for future generations
1636112 i am absolutely thrilled to be taking up the cause of food in london on behalf of the mayor there are many aspects of our current food system which are damaging our environment through wasteful practices and producing poor quality food
1636113 it simply does not need to be the case that londoners cannot have access to locally produced top quality food but we have to have a radical rethink to find ways to make this happen it is my mission to now to help find and deliver these solutions for the capitals homes and businesses
1636114 every year football supporters dread the day in which their season ticket renewal form arrives not knowing how much more they will be expected to outlay for the coming season or whether their seat has now become a vip only zone
1636115 the clubs some of whom have increased the cost of season tickets by nearly 20 justify these rises by claiming that the revenue is needed so that they compete for silverware and attract the best players
1636116 what we disagree with however is that when many of us are feeling the pinch during the credit crunch with rising fuel prices food costs and below inflation pay rises clubs are imposing these increases on their supporters so that they can hand unimaginable salary hikes to their super rich strikers or millionaire midfielders
1636117 when fans then see some of those footballers being compared to slaves its understandable that supporters feel disillusioned with their club and the sport
1636118 salary caps have worked around the world including the uk usa and australia in reducing ticket price increases and increasing competitiveness and unpredictability to their respective competitions
1636119 we see no reason why a uefa imposed salary cap cannot work in football either
1636120 road diversion notice will be put up in several strategic locations along the road

1636123 we have fought hard for this settlement as it is only right he receives significant financial compensation from the drivers employer islington borough council
1636124 the incident has had a critical impact on my life i lost my job my active lifestyle and my relationship the physical and psychological damages have been devastating and its been difficult getting my life back on track
1636125 the payout is a great result as until this point i felt no sense of justice now i finally have a chance to put this behind me and look to the future
1636126 our radical proposals to reform the welfare system are designed to ensure people can stay at or return to work if they are able to
1636127 this evidence shows working can be an important step in peoples recovery
1636128 we are looking at how we can work with employers to make sure people get the support they need in the workplace
1636129 we have proposed doubling the amount of money we make available to employers to adapt the workplace to accommodate employees with specific needs
1636130 in 2006 we reclaimed the term mcjob with our not bad for a mcjob campaign and over the past two years we have received considerable support from our employees our customers and business leaders
1636131 we feel the time is now right to take another step forward and start celebrating the mcjobs we offer
1636132 this campaign is an important milestone in the evolution of mcdonalds recruitment advertising signalling a more confident and assertive attitude towards the mcjob term
1636133 creating 4 000 new jobs is great news for our business and our franchises particularly in these tougher trading times
1636134 the uk may be entering choppy economic waters but as a company that is more recession resistant than many we can continue offering people a job with excellent career progression training and development opportunities and flexibility
1636135 labour have said over and over again that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing
1636136 it is difficult for health service estates to maintain a completely pest free environment but the level and variety of these infections is concerning
1636137 we need greater transparency in nhs infection control and publishing data like this is one way in which we can drive up overall hygiene standards
1636138 such findings are truly revolting how can patients be safe amid bed bugs fleas and rats
1636139 once again safety is just rhetoric and not a reality for patients particularly the elderly and those with suppressed immunity
1636140 what about those trusts who ignored this freedom of information request and said nothing if these are the standards of those coming clean what does it say about those who stayed silent
1636141 these findings reveal what happens when money is taken away from where patients expect to see it spent if these hospitals were restaurants they would be closed down and out of business trust boards must get a grip and show patients they are serious about their legal responsibility for safety
1636142 the use of pest control is seen as good proactive management
1636143 the health care commission have confirmed that health concerns around pest control have to date been negligible
1636144 the claim that insects spread hospital acquired infections is entirely unproven there is no evidence of their carriage of antibiotic resistant bacteria being a hazard to patients
1636145 despite this we expect hospitals to take continued action to tackle these pest problems
1636146 these figures must be put into context it goes without saying that as the fourth largest trust in the country our hospitals are bigger than most others around the country and therefore our figures should be compared with trusts with similar sized estates rather than smaller acute trusts
1636147 it is also worth bearing in mind that trusts are likely to have recorded and reported figures differently and therefore the table may not be comparing like for like data
1636148 at nottingham university hospitals we have two pest control teams operating at our two hospitals an in house qualified pest control team at city hospital campus and a contracted service at queens medical centre campus
1636149 both teams advise how we can best manage pest prevention and control and ensure the trust is meeting the required environmental health standards
1636150 the u n s disarmament policy is a global threat to human security and human rights
1636151 either they surrender and you get all the muslims out of srebrenica
1636152 but when you have thousands of women and children at risk who want desperately to be evacuated it is my responsibility to help them to save their lives i cannot enter into any philosophical or theoretical debate now
1636153 while the u n peacekeepers had collected some of the bosniacs weapons the bosniacs retained the better ones

1636169 i was a little bit surprised when the name of kevin pietersen came up to captain england
1636170 it is from the point of view that he has not really been playing for england for long and secondly he has no experience which is crucial
1636171 but the most important reason which really concerns me is what effect the captaincy will have on his batting because they definitely need him very badly to perform as a batter
1636172 it could be very difficult if he is affected by the captaincy in a very big way
1636173 i would have said for the moment put him in the one day game
1636174 the court of arbitration for sport cas has upheld the appeals filed by fc schalke 04 sv werder bremen and fc barcelona against the decision issued on 30 july 2008 by the single judge of the fifas players status committee that consequently has been set aside in its entirety
1636175 the olympic football tournament beijing 2008 is not included in the co ordinated match calendar and there is no specific decision of the fifa executive committee establishing the obligation for the clubs to release players under 23 for this tournament
1636176 the requirements to justify a legal obligation of clubs to release their players for the football tournament beijing 2008 on the basis of customary law are not met
1636177 in view of fifas recommendation made to the clubs to release their players as well as of the olympic spirit the cas call upon the good will and good sense of fifa and the clubs to find a reasonable solution with regard to players who wish to represent their country in the olympic games
1636178 the wish is to stay and were going to be getting together within the next eight days to decide
1636179 next week there will be a solution weve given ourselves time to think things over well
1636180 were not close nor far from reaching an deal nor somewhere in between
1636181 he silva wants to stay if were talking about amounts of money its because were trying to reach an agreement and were closer now than we were at the start of the meeting
1636182 i am not jose mourinho so why compare me with him mourinho says i will win 10 championships but i am more modest than that
1636183 i am from south brazil and in my culture we never say i will win this or that i just say that i will try my best to win all the competitions
1636184 but mourinho is mourinho he has a different culture to me
1636185 since i came to chelsea we have only spent 8million on deco jose bosingwa came in before i arrived
1636186 maybe in the past they have spent more money but now they dont need to spend as much because they already have a solid base now they need a coach to develop young players and i think i am that coach
1636187 the fact that it has all come together now is nothing to do with me staying here
1636188 but to have family over here gives you a better feeling because you dont feel so far away from paraguay
1636189 the situation over ownership has not changed since day one certainly not for the last five years i have been saying it at every annual general meeting since
1636190 we are looking for investment we always have been and we always will be and that continues
1636191 i do look at the clubs that have the champions league status that brings in millions and have the multi multi multi millionaires and the billionaires in them and i think that is probably what it takes now to get a hugely successful football club
1636192 there is a part of me that hopes that is not true of course there is and there always will be that feeling inside me
1636193 but if you look at that top four and the consistency of the top four there is a lot of money floating around them and we at everton do not have that money
1636194 a ground move is certainly crucial to the economic future of everton i have said it a million times that i love goodison park but we have to move for economic and financial reasons
1636195 we have to get more income into the club to begin to compete with those clubs i have been talking about
1636196 that is the reason we have been contemplating it and the truth is we have had enormous support from knowsley council from tesco and we have not had that from liverpool council that is the bottom line of it
1636197 all that talk last week about david moyes betting suspended on him going and quitting im amazed
1636198 i am on the phone to him all the time and you wonder where all this comes from
1636199 it all seemed to come from the fact that we lost a game in america last week thats all of course no one is a good loser at everton we never want to lose
1636200 the real problem this close season is that apart from steven pienaar we actually have not signed any new players
1636201 i just want to pull off one deal just one of the transfers we have been chasing for the last six weeks that would be a start and then the next one and next one
1636202 the date limit we have set to decide the future of samuel etoo is the 12th august
1636203 if there is a decision the best solution would be to do so before the champions league preliminary fantasy cricket
1636204 he had his operation yesterday fortunately weve avoided major surgery and expect him back in training in the next six to eight weeks
1636205 you never know the full story until you go into the knee thats why weve been open in terms of the prognosis
1636206 calzaghe i dont know what ive got to do perhaps shoot him in the leg to stop him running
1636207 i dont ever change my style i come forward i fight and i get in the best shape i can possible get into that is what i will do on october 18
1636208 it is a pleasure to be in the ring with hopkins never in my life did i think id be fighting hopkins
1636209 the subject is not easy but we are working on a positive solution for all parties
1636210 the decision is zaragozas but the premier league is very attractive to the player
1636211 obviously the last couple of weeks has put me in a slightly different position than what i was four weeks ago
1636212 so yeah i understand that im 20 000 euros behind justin and about 25 world ranking points out of position on the world list
1636213 theres no point looking at it any more i understand where i am and i understand that these four days coming up are going to be very important
1636214 so i just need to play well to be honest it will be what will be i cant worry about it too much i cant keep thinking about it because it will take its toll and i dont want to keep letting it affect my routine for this week
1636215 i just know what ive got to do i can only do what i can do and that is play good golf this week if i play well ill be in the side
1636216 if i play solid for the next four tournaments that im going to play if im not in the side im sure going to have a chance to be getting a pick thats what i do know
1636217 theres just been an awful lot of talk about it and ive just got to get out there and play golf and enjoy myself and if i do that then ill be in the side
1636218 i feel the way ive played if i play well this week then it makes it a very easy decision for me to probably stay this side of the pond and try and have two weeks off before the ryder cup i e next week and then the week before the ryder cup
1636219 thats what i want to do thats probably the best decision for me for my health for staying fresh is how i want to look towards the end of this week
1636220 if i really play well this week then im going to be very fresh for the ryder cup and thats how i want to keep it
1636221 if something needs to change by sunday night then we might have to look into possibly doing that going to europe but thats something which i dont really want to keep talking about this week
1636222 that is a team you would look at and say immediately it would be an honour for anyone to lead
1636223 england rugby has always been regardless whether it is the era as world cup winners finishing second or being knocked out in the quarter finals as we were in 1999 a team full of promise incredible work rate belief effort collective respect and trust
1636224 i have captained the side not as many times as others but i have always really enjoyed the job because you just have this feeling when you look at the guys around you and you think it is a pleasure to be here
1636225 you have a huge faith that these guys are doing everything they can for you so it is east to reciprocate that
1636226 i didnt do athens so as far as the team is concerned in athens i dont know what happened
1636227 but from my own personal feeling of those years where i was under bills reign its a lot more relaxed ive found the team a lot more relaxed
1636228 i wouldnt say any bad things about bill i think he did good things for the british team at the grassroots level and i think we are getting some positive and good results off the back of that
1636229 but my personal feeling coming into the team now is that there hasnt been any pack drills and that was my main concern when i was part of the team before
1636230 coming back this time two years later on i found it a lot more relaxed a lot more positive and i think well see the results off the back of that
1636231 our whole team mission is to make a step forward from the trials
1636232 we had a very successful trials from my perspective and i think a lot of the countries and certainly the australians have commented on the standard of swimming at the british trials
1636233 history has shown at previous olympics that britain hasnt stepped up to the mark in general from trials to olympic games so that has been our emphasis as a team to focus on everyone in the team to help them make that step up
1636234 so thats our mission to improve from the trials we had an excellent trials but have to build on it now that we are going head to head with the best swimmers in the world
1636235 my game is kind of coming and going right now
1636236 ive been working on trying to get it a bit more consistent but last week was kind of like a typical week for me at this point two really good rounds i thought i had something going and then kind of a so so round on sunday
1636237 so i need to try and find a bit more consistency i think for me to really feel like i can compete when the gun goes off
1636238 it was hard for me to get it going to start and then i won the masters playing some great golf all week long
1636239 after that i lost my way a little bit then i started feeling it coming together again before the us open but never really translated into any good play there i made the cut but finished way down the field there
1636240 then i went back and started working on a few more things i felt pretty good about my game going into the open championship but kind of lost a little bit of rhythm in those conditions out there i ended up finishing 19th so it was a decent week but obviously not exactly what im looking for
1636241 i would love to get to a point where the feelings dont come and go so much
1636242 so its something ive been working on just trying day to day to have some more consistency i guess thats what everybodys working on so well see how it goes
1636243 the 1500 is probably going to be the most difficult its ever been in terms of depth
1636244 the qualification is the only thing im thinking of at the moment the heats are going to be hard enough in itself just to get to the final
1636245 there are a lot of guys in there so youll have to be fast to make the final and then in the final its just going to be an absolute dogfight because so many guys this year have swum well below 15 minutes and theres not really a clear favourite
1636246 theres a lot of guys there who are so competitive so its going to be a good battle
1636247 hes a fantastic athlete and he wouldnt still be around in this sport if he didnt want to do it
1636248 going for a third title is a great testament to him as an athlete and hes going to be one of the ones to beat again
1636249 hacketts world record is phenomenal keiren perkins 14 41 was exceptional and to break that by seven seconds is unbelievable even now its probably one of the best records in the books and it could stand for a long long time
1636250 you are all swimming in a pack and you dont have a lane to yourself so it is a very physical sport and you do swim on top of each other and get the odd fist in the face and that sort of thing
1636251 its the hardest thing ive ever done adapting to the tactics of it and the physicality of it and learning to swim in a straight line without having a blue line at the bottom of the river is obviously the biggest challenge
1636252 ive got scope for improvement but theres no pressure on me because im a novice at this and its just a good thing for me to do after the pool swimming has finished
1636253 youve got 20 30 girls in close proximity and normally ill give them three strikes ill let the first two go but if i get hit a third time i might give them one back i can look after myself
1636254 im really looking forward to it swimming in the olympics is something ive dreamed about but its important to keep your head about you and realise its just another competition
1636255 we know the series is over but it is an opportunity to prove differently
1636256 we still have pride to play for and if i play it will give me the chance to put something on the board and go into the winter with something positive under my belt
1636257 i dont have many regrets about sri lanka to be fair it happened all so quickly
1636258 i didnt actually go out and change the way i played i didnt think i had to change the way i played because it was test cricket
1636259 at that time the sri lankans were too good for me it just didnt go the way i imagined it to go and it was because of good pieces of bowling sometimes and other times my own error
1636260 there were just a couple of things i had to work on because if it comes up in the future i dont want to be found out in that situation i went away and worked on them
1636261 michael vaughan had a huge amount of respect in our dressing room
1636262 i thought he was magnificent in the five years he gave to england it was very sad for all of us to watch on sunday as he gave his resignation speech and we all felt for him
1636263 a lot of the guys in our side have sent messages to him congratulating him on the job he did he really was a fantastic leader
1636264 all the guys are really looking at this as the start really
1636265 this has been a hugely significant result for us and they all want to be part of it going forward
1636266 if they keep up the standard they have been giving us there is no reason why they cant be part of the future
1636267 for us to be 2 0 coming into the last test is amazing i never thought in my wildest dreams we would be coming to the oval and it would be a dead rubber game
1636268 ive known antoinette for a long time and shes always been an innovator she knows the challenges faced by advertisers and the current state of traditional media given her viacom and nbcu experience she knows the vehicles to use to get consumers to care whether through branded extensions or original digital applications and thats very exciting for us
1636269 sbi mutual fund is a very prestigious win it was a tough fight from the word go with the top agencies competing for this account we won the business on grounds of our strategic understanding of the industry and creative work
1636270 famous athletes especially can play an important role in conveying messages about hiv prevention care and support as they are regarded as role models by young people
1636271 athletes should know about how hiv can be transmitted how it does not transmit and how hiv can be prevented this should help them to educate peers and fight discrimination against people with hiv it really is a topic relevant to sport
1636272 im excited about selling behavioral and retargeting opportunities because they are the cutting edge of web 2 0 advertising having sold traditional media for years with television stations and later selling their newly developed web inventory behavioral targeting is the next logical step for the internet and for my clients
1636273 with the support of the mgm board weve been able to make significant progress and i believe the next three years will be a testament to the power passion and creative vision of our new management team i look forward to working with the members of the mgm board to deliver on mgms promise and its future expansion plans
1636274 today consumers are time starved and attention challenged and hence even though clients hugely desire on creating brand awareness its not essential that the awareness will lead to increase in sales intentrack a continuous weekly track is a new measure of marketing accountability that identifies consumer intent actions which influence brand sales
1636275 intentrack presently is the culmination of 29 months of design fieldwork and analysis that has tracked consumer response to over 200 brands across 30 product categories in 28 countries
1636276 intentrack tracks every consumer as a single source for both output and outcome this single source study identifies all the different ways consumers interact with the brand from television to conversations in the same period the consumers intent behavior towards those brands is captured these intent behaviors range from low level behavioral shifts such as changing attitudes towards the brand to intent behaviors more directly related to purchase like seeking information talking to others and visiting a store to experiencing the brand and finally to purchase
1636277 verma with his rich experience and in depth knowledge of media industry is sure to bring in great value addition for our organisation i am sure with his leadership our team will create great entertainment for our listeners
1636278 it was just too much of a risk for me to run in london and i apologise to the british fans for not running there
1636279 but i promise i will make it up to them in gateshead
1636280 we are delighted to be able to bring two of the worlds best sprinters to gateshead and give british athletics fans the clash they have been longing to see
1636281 for such high profile athletes to commit to returning to the uk so soon after beijing clearly demonstrates that they love competing here and i know powell will be looking for a repeat performance of his last trip to gateshead
1636282 now is the time for a real debate on the future of public centre sports broadcasting which i know is under consideration and under review
1636283 all these people interested in cricket buy tv licences and surely they should have a right to expect that the public sector broadcasters mount bids for the nations summer sport as they do in the case of one of them for 12 other sports
1636284 after all just how many people play formula one if the bbc is to remain part of this it must answer to the millions of cricket fans in england and wales how it prioritises its investment in sports rights
1636285 the bbc is astonished by the comments by the ecb
1636286 weve always said any bid for live test cricket was subject to value for money and fitting into scheduling and in our view neither of these criteria were met
1636287 we have consistently argued that not having cricket as a listed event puts it out of the reach of all terrestrial broadcasters
1636288 thats the ecbs choice and they are entitled to it but its absurd to blame the bbc for this outcome
1636289 we made it extremely clear that we were prepared to consider anything we made it clear to the department of culture media and sport select committee that we would
1636290 our job is to the best all round for cricket previously we had bids from terrestrial broadcasters which wouldnt have enabled us to create the sport we have created over the last four years
1636291 you have to realise that the bbc and other broadcasters have allocated a certain amount of money for tv rights and some years ago the ecb decided what the bbc wanted to offer was not enough
1636292 it is not easy years later to redirect your money
1636293 the ecb should look deep into themselves the problem they have now is that having taken skys money the audience goes down a lot when it goes on pay tv
1636294 it was all right dawg not bad but it was just all right for me
1636295 they have scheduled a technical maintenance and will be shutting down the studio in a few hours time
1636296 the studio officials told mallika that pnc the production company run by rangita nandy had not made payments for the earlier two days of shooting with them and that is why they were not prepared to give pnc additional time
1636297 we are very happy that we can respond to our audience needs of getting news as it happens
1636298 this pro consumer pact means that lg tru2way hdtvs planned for 2009 and beyond will receive the newest interactive cable services from video on demand to interactive programming guides in virtually every media market and without a set top box equally significant it will facilitate the development of a viable two way retail market
1636299 tru2way will allow cable operators consumer electronics manufacturers content owners and others to work together to provide creative interactive services directly to the consumer

1636311 despite some dire predictions uk television advertising held up relatively well over the first half of the year and through the summer
1636312 itv estimates that total net advertising revenue for the eight months to august will be down one per cent year on year with itv plc net advertising revenue flat
1636313 however on current estimates the television advertising market has weakened significantly in september where trading is impacted by tough comparisons with the successful rugby world cup in 2007
1636314 in our life and pensions businesses net flows were strong sales showed good growth and profitability was maintained

1636316 opportunity for lonmin shareholders to realise significant cash premium at a time of ongoing operational challenges
1636317 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1636318 shareholders are strongly advised to take no action in respect of the pre conditional offer
1636319 todays announcement marks the next step in our strategy to develop a significant platinum business and add further scale and diversification to our portfolio

1636321 this is yet another worrying set of statistics confirming that the financial crisis continues to deepen
1636322 particularly concerning is the construction sector which usually shows a strong requirement for temporary labour
1636323 this is a clear indication that the credit crunch has started to reach the jobs market
1636324 business confidence is low and as a result employers are becoming much more cautious
1636325 the anthrax attacks might be tied to osama bin laden and the al qaida terrorist network
1636326 and i think there are people within our government certainly from the source of it who know where it came from

1636328 scuse me maam could you reach up there and hand me that pillow
1636329 in recent months we have seen a significant increase in home improvement personal loan requests for the last decade homeowners have been able to sit back and rely on rising property prices to increase the equity in their home but sadly this is no longer possible if you want to trade up and avoid substantially increasing your mortgage youll need to add value to the house youre currently in whether your motivation is a quick sale adding long term value or accommodating changing lifestyle needs its vital you consider the financial investment youre about to make
1636330 i dont have a problem with guilt about money the way i see it is that my money represents an enormous number of claim checks on society its like i have these little pieces of paper that i can turn into consumption if i wanted to i could hire 10 000 people to do nothing but paint my picture every day for the rest of my life and the gnp would go up but the utility of the product would be zilch and i would be keeping those 10 000 people from doing aids research or teaching or nursing i dont do that though i dont use very many of those claim checks theres nothing material i want very much and im going to give virtually all of those claim checks to charity when my wife and i die
1636331 im not crying wolf and im not saying the sky is falling
1636332 but we do have a budget shortfall this year that is likely to still be there at the beginning of next year
1636333 we hope to double sales in the opening year and in five to six years sales should be up to 2 5 million
1636334 our main concern now is to locate the stolen drugs and bring the culprits to book
1636335 that is not our intention we just want them to help in the investigations
1636336 youll hear some r amp b during the show soul uptempo midtempo its not all ballads
1636337 i still love my ballads and i wanted to do more but my producers said you need more uptempo numbers
1636338 i feel very excited and very proud because the olympic games is a 100 year dream of chinas
1636339 we did this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool
1636340 the conditions are not unfavourable at the moment and my understanding is that we are not going to be taking any extra measures
1636341 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1636342 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1636343 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1636344 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1636345 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1636346 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1636347 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1636348 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1636349 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1636350 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1636351 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation
1636352 i have no idea why john mccain doesnt support it it hurts him in indiana and missouri and ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear
1636353 to lower trade barriers decrease trade distorting subsidies and stabilize an affordable food supply for all nations
1636354 reasonable reforms to our crop insurance program and our system of countercyclical and direct aid payments
1636355 hell begin a rehab programme and the decision to operate will be deferred for the next week to 10 days

1636363 were looking forward to learning more about international paper and what this opportunity will mean for our employees our plant and this community
1636364 weve been preparing for this transition for the last few months and it feels good to be moving forward

1636367 this time i dont think he will have time to have a suit made
1636368 if he does order a suit theyll tell us at the last minute
1636369 thank you for your questions why dont you go find a shade tree to stand under
1636370 our radical proposals to reform the welfare system are designed to ensure people can stay at or return to work if they are able to
1636371 this evidence shows working can be an important step in peoples recovery
1636372 we are looking at how we can work with employers to make sure people get the support they need in the workplace
1636373 we have proposed doubling the amount of money we make available to employers to adapt the workplace to accommodate employees with specific needs
1636374 the research found that early intervention is critical in addressing mental health problems at work
1636375 often adjustments to the persons role or workplace need only be minor and inexpensive
1636376 i just left last thursday and i had occasion to talk to one of the ladies there and already right now they sound swamped to tell you the truth
1636377 its quite a program because they keep people aboard who seem to have been good employees
1636378 the few i know about are in pretty high level jobs
1636379 hiring someone as a retired annuitant gives us a cost effective way to hire a retired professional with a proven track record of public service
1636380 they can be put to work in any part of state operations usually to supplement additional needs in highly specialized areas annuitants allow us to quickly tap into a workforce with years of experience to staff up or down as needed at that time
1636381 you dont often see the democratic party the republican party the california league of conservation voters and the chamber of commerce all in opposition
1636382 clearly many of the groups in opposition are groups with an indisputable record of support for renewable energy
1636383 im aware of no renewable energy company or environmental group with a record of involvement in renewable energy who has any support for this initiative
1636384 for reasons that i still dont understand and the campaign has never explained they changed the definition of eligible renewable resource under the california renewable energy mandate
1636385 they added the phrase solar and clean energy which is the initiative brand
1636386 we feel they are flat out lying about some of the provisions
1636387 we think we can plainly show through independent experts that its a lie
1636388 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1636389 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1636390 women particularly mothers can experience considerable strain when attitudes reinforce the notion that employment and family interests conflict
1636391 if we are to make progress in devising policies that encourage equal working opportunities for women we need to know more about what gender roles people view as practical as possible and as fair
1636392 we are appalled by this incident and hope the perpetrators are quickly identified
1636393 the beanscene brand is very strong and this has been reflected in the support provided to date by employees landlords suppliers and customers
1636394 the number of inquiries we have received about the business now stands at almost 150
1636395 however we would urge all parties interested in acquiring the business to contact us
1636396 a leader is a person with a god given capacity and a god given responsibility to influence a specific group of gods people toward gods purposes for the group

1636399 matt and yvette came in to our school to give us lessons on stop the traffik and telling us all about the injustice of the world due to this i became very interested in it and want to do more to try and stop it
1636400 theyve been availbale at break times so that students who have just come to us have a place that they can call a safe haven where they can talk through some of the issues they might have with an adult its a nice place for yr 7s who are new to the school to go to
1636401 matt and yvette came in to our school to give us lessons on stop the traffik and telling us all about the injustice of the world due to this i became very interested in it and want to do more to try and stop it

1636403 bener nggak sih tumbu apa sumbu ya kalau asal kerja sih banyak tapi belum tentu sesuai dengan keinginan kita begitu juga dengan pacar nggak asal bilang iya ketika ada yang nembak meskipun saya tahu ada beberapa cewek yang tidak bisa menolak

1636405 kenapa harus kalau aku nggak suka gimana kalau kerjaannya nggak cocok gimana

1636408 have already contributed more to halvorson than ive raised in my total campaign
1636409 i think this is a win win for the democrats
1636410 the two that are going to go forward are jon halvorson and sandra romero and we support them both
1636411 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
1636412 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem

1636418 every moment we spent on ads was a moment lost on the content
1636419 no one was ready because no one could sell out our inventory across all our our platforms
1636420 we now have one of the most prominent advertising solutions out there along with increased distribution a road map for expansion and a guarantee that i believe is an unprecedented deal for this space
1636421 one of the major concerns is that these closures are illogical it is simply a computer which has decided to close a post office which is deemed too close to another even if it happens to be profitable and easily accessed by its customers
1636422 the post office is complacently assuming that all of the business at the closing profitable office will simply migrate to surviving branches this conveniently supposes people will travel the extra distance irrespective of the public transport connections or the accessibility for vulnerable groups and the elderly
1636423 whilst the government says it is listening we will be fighting to save post offices across huddersfield and the colne and holme valleys
1636424 many small communities across penistone and stocksbridge rely on these post offices but now they are told that their local branches are being closed
1636425 conservatives will be campaigning against these cuts and i hope to see as many people as possible signing our latest petition
1636426 this is my local branch so i share your anger at this decision
1636427 ministers have taken no account of the needs of the elderly of disabled people or of the most disadvantaged the very ones who will lose out most
1636428 colin is a very able and experienced public representative who will strengthen the conservative team working on behalf of local residents across the district
1636429 i am looking forward being part of the conservative group working with them for the good of the bradford district
1636430 i will also continue to work hard on behalf of the constituents of eccleshill ward no matter what as i have done since i was elected

1636450 a ver tita a t te gustar a que te dejara mi caca en el cenicero
1636451 i was at hexham last weekend and dean said a couple of words to me i could tell he was finding it agonising but he kept soldiering on watching him in the final event the 1500m brought a lump to my throat
1636452 i went to california for warm weather training with dean earlier this year
1636453 i learnt a lot from him on that trip he showed great professionalism in the way he conducted himself in the way he co operated with physios and in the manner which he spoke to greg
1636454 i cant believe he wont be competing anymore but i fear if he carried on he would have done himself some damage he said this was going to be his final year its just a shame he didnt finish his career with a third olympics
1636455 the decathletes and heptathletes tend to compete at different meetings to the others but at least i know kelly sotherton and im good friends with julie hollman
1636456 going out there with the team will be pretty special ill be wow theres simeon williamson and phillips idowu i hope they take me under their wings
1636457 my coach greg is good friends with daley and this larger than life image appeared in my mind whenever he talked about him
1636458 daley told me i would enjoy the olympics and that the first experience would blow my mind he also told me to watch all the top names like roman sebrle and bryan clay and not to be scared to ask them questions so i could learn and become a better athlete
1636459 when someone like that gives you that sort of advice you listen
1636460 the main thing for me is to learn from this experience the crowd the competition the big names travelling with the team and being an olympian
1636461 im hoping to break the magical 8 000 points mark
1636462 london 2012 is my target and by then ill have trained harder and ill be stronger and faster

1636476 to be classified as a new old gay requires more than an appreciation of patti lupone though love of somewhat tragic just a tad grotesque totally fabulous divas is a requirement in some ways the new old gay can be read as a reassertion of a gay identity that had all but been given up for dead if gays can be married and have children and live contentedly in the suburbs or on the other end of the spectrum do the same drugs at the same loft parties as their oberlin classmates and if everyone thinks aids is no more serious than diabetes then really whats the difference between the gays and the straights by dialing back to and reinventing the old gay stereotypes they may have the best shot at reclaiming gayness as something actually different
1636477 and by extension the leather bars which served as meeting grounds
1636478 fetishism will live on places to get drunk and look for sex will live on
1636479 however the subculture culture needs these spaces and supports them they will exist
1636480 we demand the best for our children even if you dont
1636481 it is stupid to continue to knowingly allow incompetent and corrupt adults to destroy the lives of children with no sense of urgency to correct the situation and no regard for the families that these corrupt and incompetent adults destroy
1636482 ah apakah kau tak bosan selalu menikmati kesepian dengan kesendirian
1636483 tidak aku begitu mengkhawatirkanmu kau kurasa orang yang aneh ke mana mana sering kulihat sendiri ke kampus sendiri di kamar sering sendiri belajar sendiri jalan jalan sendiri bahkan makan di warung atau di kantinpun kau lebih banyak terlihat sendiri kau antisosial ya
1636484 ya mungkin karena urusanku sebenarnya belum melibatkan orang lain mandi juga harus sendiri kan
1636485 itu tidaklah penting suatu saat mungkin engkau akan mengutuk arti kesendirian kenapa kau tidak seperti anak anak sma yang sering ada di gelap nyawang 1 itu meraka selalu beramai ramai kalau makan mengapa tidak seperti teman temanmu mereka selalu bersama sam kalau jalan jalanpun mereka sama sama
1636486 coba kau lihat apa yang mereka lakukan jauh dari apa yang menjadi kebiasaanku bahkan mungkin dien ku anak sma itu kalau makan di gelap nyawang kulihat mereka malah asyik ngobrol berduaan dempetan dengan lawan jenis pegangan tangan merokok pula ya alloh selamatkan negeri ini dari kebobrokan remajanya
1636487 ah kau terlalu berlebihan aku tak menyuruhmu seperti itu kau bisa saja ajak temanmu yang lain
1636488 aku selalu melakukan itu kalau aku ada keperluan dengan temanku tidak hanya keperluan kalau mungkin aku dan dia lama tak jumpa kami sering ngobrol lama dan bercerita kau lihat apa yang aku lakukan lebih memiliki dibanding anak sma yang tadi
1636489 aku punya pengalaman yang kurang mengenakkan dengan anak anak sma yang makan di gelap nyawang itu waktu itu juga abis isya aku pikir kok ada ya anak sma jam segini masih berkeliaran bergerombol pula mereka berpasangan yang cewek pakaiannya naudzubillah walaupun pakaian sma lebih mirip pakaian sd kecil sekali yang cowok juga sama parahnya tangan yang satu memegang tangan ceweknya tangan yang lain dipakai untuk memegang rokok
1636490 gerombolan sma itu mendekat ke arah meja tempat aku makan aku tak ambil peduli dengan kedatangan mereka tapi anehnya mereka malah makin bergerombol di tempat aku makan kemudian salah seorang di antara mereka berteriak ke si pemilik warung mas gak ada tempat yang kosong ya aku kaget juga mendengar itu menyadari hal itu si pemilik warung kebingungan kemudian ia memintaku yang duduk di bangku itu untuk pindah ke meja pojok yang masih kosong maaf mas bisa diisi dulu tempat yang di sana masih ada yang kosong tuh begitu si pemilik warung itu menyuruhku pindah tak berapa lama meja yang aku tempati tadi diisi oleh anak anak sma kulihat mereka malah acuh dengan hal itu
1636491 nah itulah akibatnya kau makan sendiri coba kalau kau makan berdua atau bertiga atau ber berapalah asalkan tidak sendiri pasti kejadian itu tak akan terjadi
1636492 aku tak menyesali kejadian itu hanya aku merasa miris anak sma kok udah begitu ya aku benar benar terkejut
1636493 zaman udah modern bung kalau kau tidak begitu orang orang akan banyak yang tidak simpati padamu
1636494 percayalah kau jangan menjadi aneh sendiri dengan gayamu seperti itu bisa bisa nanti kau tak akan mendapatkan pendamping hidup
1636495 oi logikanya tidak seperti itu aku tak mau membahas itu rasanya tak ada hubungannya dengan apa yang kita bicarakan ini aku sudah punya rencana dan strategi untuk itu tapi ayolah jangan buat sebuah proses mencari pendamping hidup kau kerdilkan maknanya
1636496 ok kita tak akan membahas itu tapi coba kau lihat temanmu teman temanmu kan seumuran denganmu kurasa pemikiran mereka tak akan seekstrem apa yang dilakukan oleh anak sma tadi mereka selalu berdua bersama mendiskusikan banyak hal tapi aku sering melihatmu tak berada di sana bahkan dosenmu sampai bilang kau selalu sendiri saja
1636497 tunggu kau juga harus lihat apa yang dilakukan temanku dan apa yang dikatakan oleh dosenku
1636498 ah kau terlalu banyak mencari alasan untuk melakukan sebuah pembenaran
1636499 bukan aku hanya mempertahankan apa yang menurutku pantas dan sesuai dengan apa yang aku yakini kau tak akan mengerti akan hal ini
1636500 ok ok apa yang ingin kau beri tahu padaku tentang mereka
1636501 aku punya teman baik dulu aku dan dia satu kelompok dalam acara pelantikan kader inti gamais kau tahu kan gamais
1636502 ya tahulah aku juga banyak tahu apa yang kau tahu
1636503 dia menjadi ketua kelompok kami dia bahkan menjadi masul dalam pembinaan lanjut setelah pelantikan itu dia menjadi ketua kelompok mentoring kelompokku dia kuanggap orang yang hebat pemahaman islamnya pasti di atasku akan tetapi kini kulihat dia jauh berbeda lama kami tak bertemu suatu hari kami bertemu di kantin salman bersama seorang wanita entah siapa hai der ia menyapaku aku cukup merasa aneh karena biasanya dulu dia selalu menyapaku dengan ucapan salam sembari menunjukkan senyumannya tapi saat itu ia menyapaku biasa saja datar
1636504 sebentar aku belum menyelesaikan ceritaku yang membuatku kaget dia memegang tangan cewek itu aku terkesiap dengan asyiknya dia ngobrol dengan cewek itu seolah aku tak ada di depannya
1636505 mungkin dia sudah menikah kan banyak tuh temen temenmu yang udah pada ngebet nikah
1636506 entahlah tapi tak ada hal yang dapat meyakinkanku akan hal itu pada peristiwa itu aku rasa ia berbeda dengan yang dulu maksudmu seperti itu aku agar tidak sendiri
1636507 baik baiklah aku tak mau berdebat tentang itu tapi apakah kau yakin dengan kedinginanmu itu kau akan tahan dengan suasana seperti ini
1636508 kurasa cerita itu tak mampu membuatmu diam aku punya teman lagi dia kakak seniorku dulu dia yang menyambutku pertama kali di institut ini kau tahu bagaimana dia menyambutku sebagai mahasiswa baru
1636509 dia bersamaku bersama kami melaksanakan shalat ashar berjamaah ia menjadi imam kulihat dulu penampilannya sangat menyejukkan wajahnya terlihat memancarkan ketenangan aku masih ingat pesannya dulu kepadaku dan teman temanku jangan menyerah berada dalam masalah ini adalah tantangan kalian perjuangkan apa yang kalian pilih dan menurut kalian benar kurang lebih pesannya begitu aku masih ingat pesan itu sampai sekarang aku merasa bersyukur bertemu sosok yang demikian memesona saat aku pertama kali menginjakkan kaki di institut ini akan tetapi kekagumanku padanya kini musnah ia telah mengkhianati teladan yang ia bangun sendiri saat pertama aku bersamanya
1636510 ia kini jauh dari hal hal yang dulu aku temui kini ia tampak menjenuhkan bagiku suatu ketika saat kami pulang dari perjalanan kuliah lapangan kulihat ia duduk sekursi dengan seorang cewek cewek itu temanku
1636511 ah wajar kan belum ada apa apa itu kau cemburu ya
1636512 hey hey yang begitu tak menarik minatku akan tetapi tak sewajarnya ia begitu tapi yang membuatku kaget adalah ketika ia mengusap pipi cewek itu cewek itu dengan nyaman menyandarkan kepalanya kemudian kakak senior itu berujar tidur ya dek rasanya saat itu adalah saat termuak aku melihatnya
1636513 ia telah berubah kini ia lebih sering mengucapkan kata kata kotor bahkan aku sempat mendengar pengakuan rasa bersalahnya terhadap temanku itu maafkan kakak yang sering lupa shalat subuh untuk mendoakanmu kedengarannya perhatian atau permintaan maaf yang tulus tapi sayang itu dibungkus dengan bau busuk
1636514 ah kau terlalu berlebihan tak pantas kau menilainya seperti itu
1636515 lalu apakah kau juga pantas menilaiku seperti tadi padahal apa yang kau nilai tentangku belum benar adanya aku menilainya karena berdasar apa yang aku lihat naif sekali kau
1636516 sudahlah tak ada gunanya begini toh aku menginginkanmu tak seperti ini banyak cara untuk bisa berdua atau bersama sama tapi tak seekstrem seperti yang kau ceritakan barusan
1636517 aku tak yakin dengan pernyataanmu kalau kau menginginkan aku tak sendiri tiap beraktivitas tiu juga sering aku lakukan cuman aku mencoba menghindar dari kesia siaan dan dari keinginan busukmu terhadapku
1636518 sudahlah aku tak mau berpanjang kata aku tak mau mempersoalkan hal yang sia sia berhentilah
1636519 setidaknya kau belum mau juga membuka diri pada orang lain aku yakin kau orang hebat mengapa tak kau tunjukkan apa yang kau kemampuan yang kau miliki pada orang lain
1636520 jangan mengalihkan maksud pembicaraan ku yakin tujuan utamamu padaku bukan itu
1636521 aku pikir apa yang terjadi pada teman temanmu itu wajar saja banyak kok sekarang yang seperti itu coba bukalah dirimu aku yakin kau bisa lebih baik dari mereka
1636522 dengan mengikuti perilaku mereka heuh untuk saat ini itu tak menarik minatku sama sekali
1636523 aku dengar ia rajin mengikuti tatsqif rutin kenal baik dengan beberapa aktivis gamais tapi entah bagaimana mulanya aku juga jadi muak melihat tingkahnya
1636524 ini diawali ketika ia mundur dari aktivitas ldps mungkin ia kecewa tapi pelarian dari kekecewaan itu yang membuat ia malah keluar total dari aktivitas aku dan dia sebelumnya
1636525 ia kini juga berubah pernah aku main ke kosannya kulihat beberapa cd film yang covernya menampilkan wanita seronok aku terdiam melihat itu ia sekarang jadi sering marah perkataannyapun tak lagi bersahabat dengan telingaku kata katanya jauh dari yang aku dengar dulu dan kini ia sedang mendekati kakak seniornya entahlah itu juga aku dengar dari teman temanku yang lain tapi kulihat ia memang sering jalan berdua sering nonton berdua juga aku kehilangan teman teman seperti dulu aku tak mampu berbuat apa apa karena aku sendiri
1636526 dengar ya aku tak antisosial seperti yang kau kira aku manusia biasa aku butuh interaksi aku butuh manusia lain dalam perjalanan hidupku namun caranya aku ke sana yang tidak bersepakat dengan kehendakmu terhadapku aku tahu apa yang terjadi padaku aku pahami itu
1636527 sayang sekali berarti mereka telah menghabiskan pikirannya dengan dugaan dugaan yang tak ada gunanya
1636528 ya terserah padamu rasanya bagiku tak ada gunanya orang lain berpikir tentangku seperti apa yang kau pikir tentang aku aku kira mereka buang buang waktu dan energi saja tidak produktif dan tidak ada manfaatnya tapi aku akan tunjukkan bahwa aku tidak seperti apa yang mereka pikirkan ah mengapa aku jadi menduga duga tak jelas begini
1636529 begini aku berpikir positif saja aku yakin pasti lebih banyak orang lain yang tidak berpikir sepertimu terhadapku dibanding orang yang berpikir sama sepertimu terhadapku dan aku rasakan itu memang
1636530 mengapa kau bertanya begitu aku sendiri nyaman dengan kondisi ini
1636531 jauh dalam lubuk sukmamu terdalam tidakkah saran saranmu itu bertentangan dengan hati kecilmu kau berlaku itu padaku karena kau harus menepati janjimu kau harus menunaikan tugasmu kau harus menebus sesuatu yang akan kau hadapi nanti dengan konfrontasi seperti ini

1636578 i love felipe we just couldnt get the talent out on the field and its time for us to go in a different direction im rooting for him i hope he gets it together cause he sure has a lot of physical talent
1636579 we want players here that are going to hustle that are going to play the game hard and play the game right
1636580 for people who play this game its hard when you struggle you roll over a ball and you cuss yourself out down the first base line it might seem like im not hustling to other people its just frustration
1636581 leave me completely let me move on and live my life because you have a hold on me
1636582 yeah its a nice blade it supposedly belonged to one of the soldiers on the ship that first arrived in this continent when it was first established over 700 years ago by the original settlers
1636583 and the blade being encrusted with gemstones of sort i would say 10000 credits
1636584 im offering more than it was offered for so now im doing business
1636585 excuse me miss but i couldnt help but notice your beautiful eyes
1636586 my eyes huh ive never been complimented on my eyes before oh wait yes i have many times
1636587 well what about your hair hmm can i comment on that instead
1636588 its silky smooth and its a very nice shade of pink
1636589 so is mine i bet youve never seen purple hair before
1636590 master why do you have a master youre not an anihu
1636591 my master is like family to me hes just like a brother
1636592 doesnt mean i have to have sex with him god where would you get that idea
1636593 no actually i broke up with my most recent boyfriend a few weeks ago
1636594 a pretty girl like you would most likely have one at least i think so
1636595 i may or may not did i say that i thought you were pretty
1636596 i didnt say i thought you were pretty merely i meant that you fit the standard that society has set for beauty long legs silky hair a nice chest
1636597 does it matter what only one person thinks about something
1636598 because i dont even know your name and you dont even know mine
1636599 and i suppose you want to know my name huh
1636600 weve only just met as previously stated plus it would have to be romantic
1636601 ive finished all of the masters chores for him and he wont be back till later tonight hes out on a date with his new girlfriend
1636602 so you really dont have any relations with him after all and here i thought you were just being defensive
1636603 i know i was just giving you a hard time
1636604 that is what replay is going to be there for and replay is coming very soon i cant give you a date but its going to be this year
1636605 there are a lot of factors in replay that i could go on and on about there are a lot of ballparks that are not umpire friendly when it comes to border calls thats how they build them theyre fan friendly and they dont want to change that
1636606 do we like that no but you know what were losing that war so well accept it and well move on and deal with however major league baseball wants us to deal with it and thats about all i can say about it but victorinos line drive is a perfect example of why they want replay
1636607 i look at it now and it looks like it just went foul just missed the pole foul ball after talking to the guys nobody was 100 percent sure one way or the other were not going to flip a call unless weve got it 100 percent
1636608 he goes i dont know i think you missed it but i dont know and he was the closest guy to it
1636609 from a technical standpoint why wouldnt we want to get the play right it seems like we were kind of behind the times and everybody knew what the call was except for the four guys umpires on the field

1636616 tata steels revenue for fiscal year end march 31 2008 released by the company after the global 500 publication deadline was 32 8 billion
1636617 had the information been available the company would have placed 231 on the list the company ranked 315th in the listing based on revenue for the four quarters ended dec 31 2007 of 25 7 billion
1636618 this is the first time that the company has made an entry into the prestigious list of top 500 companies of the world
1636619 of all the companies featured in the list of global 500 companies tata steel has registered the biggest increase in revenues with a percentage change of 353 2 per cent from 2006 tata steel has registered revenue of 32 8 billion
1636620 opportunities even as tata motors constantly expands its portfolio of passenger vehicle products and services including the recently unveiled peoples car the tata nano
1636621 india is on a fast growth trajectory for the car market and is expected to continue this pace through out the next decade with a turnover of over rs 32 000 crore rs 320 billion tata motors is already indias largest automobile company
1636622 tata passenger car brands like the indica indigo sumo and the safari have earned the trust of over a million customers and the number is growing with each passing year
1636623 new variants of the nano are also currently under development to meet the new environmental and fuel price challenges as also the market requirement of several international markets
1636624 the olympics will offer us a fabulous opportunity to showcase marriott internationals growing brand portfolio both to the chinese people and to the travelers coming to beijing from around the world
1636625 speculators or more accurately financial investors are no fools just as in any other financial market so in the market for oil they are a consequence and not a cause of the tight underlying situation
1636626 they financial investors invest where they see good opportunities and divest where they see demand falling short of supply and therefore expect prices to fall
1636627 investors follow expectations which are following real developments and real production and consumption numbers
1636628 in essence it was a truncation error in the final printout
1636629 the problem was identified and fixed the error did not change the outcome
1636630 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1636631 we carry triumph and ducati bikes two of the biggest european brands
1636632 up front we have the more modern line of triumph the tiger the speed triple the sprint st the new rocket they range from sport touring bikes naked sport bikes cruisers all the way through to the classics like the bonneville
1636633 the ducati line is more geared towards the sport line
1636634 this years version the 696 is a fun riding bike its the lightest bike in its class at about 355 pounds but it puts out a good amount of power thats synonymous with ducati
1636635 then you just hold on because man theyve got some anger behind them
1636636 its hard to stock everything but we can pretty much order anything for anybody
1636637 i started out as a hardcore motorcyclist and a business professional and i spent years traveling around the world as a sales and marketing executive
1636638 after one more merger id been through seven in my career i was over in europe with my wife and i decided that i wanted to do something else
1636639 i said if i could do anything id open up a motorcycle dealership and she said why dont you do it
1636640 one of the only things that i had in my business plan that could truly be catastrophic failure was that if i was unable to get motorcycles from triumph being a one dealer line and thats what happened
1636641 fortunately we heard about that fire early so i literally called up my triumph rep and placed an order of 30 motorcycles and they fulfilled that order which helped carry me through
1636642 having the multiple lines makes us a stronger dealership which is better for our customers as well
1636643 they are super light and small which allows smaller customers particularly women to have a true starter bike that theyll use for a year or two and then grow out of it
1636644 picked up the schwinn line and subsequently the vespa piaggio line
1636645 this is our third season with vespa piaggio and we are literally just about sold out of everything we can get our hands on
1636646 are very concerned about style because they get top quality and style with the vespas
1636647 if i was not on route 1 i was not going to be successful because we had dealerships north and south of us
1636648 we endeavor to build the best service team in the northeast and im fairly confident were most of the way there if not all the way there

1636653 the application of genomic discoveries to our approach in diagnosing and ultimately treating cancers has transformed the molecular diagnostics industry
1636654 i strongly believe that the company best able to efficiently convert high caliber genomic discoveries to high caliber diagnostic tests will lead the industry in this growing and lucrative sector of the diagnostic market i am convinced that combimatrix is ideally positioned to do just this and i am excited to have the opportunity to help them expand that market leadership position
1636655 i am very pleased to have someone of dr collinss considerable accomplishment and innovativeness in the field of cancer research join our science advisory board
1636656 our ability to engage world class scientists like dr collins is testament to our caliber as a company he brings to our team a wealth of knowledge and experience that will help to accelerate our efforts to expand our continually growing portfolio of revolutionary tests to include amongst others our anticipated prostate cancer test by the end of the year
1636657 the beanscene brand is very strong and this has been reflected in the support provided to date by employees landlords suppliers and customers
1636658 the number of inquiries we have received about the business now stands at almost 150
1636659 however we would urge all parties interested in acquiring the business to contact us

1636661 family recipes are a valuable resource for a family history
1636662 a family recipe is also a family history and can be a wonderful work of folk art
1636663 start with a family letter asking everyone to send back one or more of their specialties by a particular date ask those who can to reply by email so you can cut and paste recipes right into your final document
1636664 this last bit of information is always the most important part of passing along a recipe
1636665 you can use the color copies you make as background and print a recipe over the photo or have the recipe on one page and a photo on the facing page you can also create a collage using items such as blue ribbons won for a cooking tickets stubs or airplane tickets from a favorite trip that produced a great recipe
1636666 this way you can add a new recipe every year

1636677 they hope that by shooting loyalists in the security forces theyll cause ian paisley to have another brainstorm and start another harold wilson but give the loyalists an ultimatum in which case its all up for grabs
1636678 although ira activity is frequently intensive and highly successful in any particular week or over a period of weeks there are other periods of little or no apparent activity
1636679 well i think that the answer to that is that this is the nature of guerrilla warfare vietnam is the one guerrilla war that people refer to as the textbook guerrilla operation but in fact prior to hardly a shot had been fired after that of course everything changed if you take the algerian struggle actions were few and intermittent cyprus was the same in malaya there were very few brits killed over a three year period the ira suffers from a number of drawbacks firstly unlike many liberation movements there is no government supporting us militarily or financially we have a small land area in which to fight and are one of the few guerrilla armies that lives and fights in the occupied area we are fighting a major world force which has massive resources and at our backs is spending millions of pounds trying to help defeat us we have political enemies throughout the world trying to cut our lines of supply in the occupied area we have over fifty per cent of the population collaborating with the enemy 1169 comment and now these same provos are salaried and suited to share space with those same collaborators our biggest single asset is the nationalist people who by and large support us to varying degrees all our support today lies with our own people just as in 1916 the proclamation said that the irish people were relying for the most part on their own strength so in the light of all the minus points we do have periods when we have an inability to strike and to keep momentum going but if you look back say over a two year period youll see that we do have continuity and we do continue to strike also it should be stressed that while there is a natural ebb and flow caused by logistical problems etc it is a mistake to judge the intensity of the struggle using solely the level of operations as a guideline while operational levels will fluctuate political work in ira based areas like education recruitment and expanding the support base all continue on a daily basis

1636688 russell i started the turtle program in april 2007 i had done futures trading on my own with a small loss i started two trading accounts with 42 000 in each one was the turtle methodology and the other was using futures news letters and on line futures information the turtles account as of 11 15 07 is 109 000 for a more than 150 gain in 6 months or so my other account is at 44 500 i used the money management rules and even missed some big moves the turtle program works so well because it takes the emotion out of it in my self directed account i lost over 10 000 this year in natural gas i had heard the long line of experts predicting 10 00 natural gas i saw natural gas traders interviewed that did nothing but follow the direction of natural gas and they agreed to 10 00 gas i saw three different ceos of huge natural gas companies say that 10 00 natural gas is a sure thing with all these people that are way more knowledgeable than i will ever be about natural gas predicting 10 00 gas how could i lose buying natural gas 8 00 well i did and i lost over 10 000 the turtle program tells you which way the market is going you do not have to know about grains or energies or metals it is a great program that works i have looked at others and this is the best thanks
1636689 good morning mr sands this had been my absolute best trading year ever thanks to your system per earlier note about references i would be honored to speak with potential customers i have been trading futures and options for over 18 years and this is the most consistently winning technique i have used almost every month shows new profits since i began trading it 5 months ago i am up well over 100
1636690 hello russell im glad to say your turtle program is living up to my hopes i would never trade the markets without a market wizard like you leading the way if i had continued to trade on my own i would have lost everything since joining the turtle program i can see the day when i will regain my losses amp start down the road to profits i only wish i would have never traded on my own but every day in your turtle program is another step toward recovery i want everyone who is thinking of trading the markets to know that mr russell sands is a man of his word one of those rare few who can help you reach your financial goals thank you russell for helping me get my life back on track because without you and your turtle program the future would not be so bright
1636691 thanks for talking to me this afternoon im pleased with the turtle program purchased 10 23 2006 as you said the 50 gain is great and im delighted that the 75m 5m plan is worth 110 474 i hope the future with this program is as bright
1636692 i have been involved with the turtle program for currencies since april of this year since i have a career i just dont have the time to monitor what is going on in any of the markets and with the turtle program i dont have to do that everything is taking care of by the people that really know what they are doing its worked out so great for me that i have recommended this program to my father and brother they are both now trading currencies with this program and have been very satisfied with their returns as well now i certainly would not have recommended this program to them unless i was confident in this market and how it is being managed by you thanks and keep up the good work this is the only investment program i have ever been involved in that i am truly satisfied with all aspects of it
1636693 almost every month shows new profits since i began trading it 5 months ago i am up well over 100

1636718 those excluded from the banquets of the rich took to the streets
1636719 nothing is more degrading than hunger especially when man made it breeds anger social disintegration ill health and economic decline
1636720 only by acting together in partnership can we overcome this crisis today and for tomorrow hundreds of millions of the worlds people expect no less
1636721 none of these factors in isolation would have caused the very high increases we are seeing
1636722 the complex causes of the food and agriculture crisis require an equally complex and comprehensive response
1636723 from 1980 to 2005 aid to agriculture fell from 8 billion to 3 4 billion agricultures share of official development assistance fell from 17 percent in 1980 to 3 percent in 2006
1636724 we believe the most comprehensive way to deal with high food prices hunger and poverty is to invest in agriculture and raise food production
1636725 it was only when the destitute and those excluded from the banquets of the rich took to the streets to voice their discontent and despair
1636726 the time for talking is long past now is the time for action
1636727 you should know each other and you should report strange people and strange activities
1636728 i had a motorcycle of my own in high school
1636729 we had our house built in what was the boondocks
1636730 there were only two other houses that existed at the time in the jungle
1636731 before tv unless you had money to go to chicago to see popular orchestras you would listen to them on the radio
1636732 people need to realize we are a significant part of the economy not only the value of the crops but the people we employ and the products we buy from local businesses
1636733 we dont rely on as heavily on fuel as other segments
1636734 but all the fruit i grow has to ride a truck to the driscolls cooler
1636735 ok guys i helped pick up lots of trash around this area so dont litter
1636736 are you tired because youve been running through my mind alllll day
1636737 was yo daddy a meat burglar cause it looks like someone jammed a couple of big ol hams down the back of yo pants
1636738 i wish i was dna helicase so i could unzip your genes
1636739 if you were a pirate would the parrot sit on this shouder
1636740 is there a mirror in your pocket because i can see myself in your pants
1636741 do you believe in love at first sight or should i walk by again
1636742 i might be a physics major but im no bohr in bed
1636743 i wish i were derivative so i could lie tangent to your curves
1636744 im not fred flinstone but i sure can make your bed rock
1636745 i wanna be your derivative so i can be tangent to all your curves
1636746 it brings neighbors close together to support each other and to work together against crime and gangs and violence
1636747 were looking forward to learning more about international paper and what this opportunity will mean for our employees our plant and this community
1636748 weve been preparing for this transition for the last few months and it feels good to be moving forward
1636749 as fishermen reel up the fish the pelicans say to each other look at the fish and they go for them
1636750 the birds end up getting tangled in the lines and the fishermen get mad
1636751 when the smaller fish are in the bay and the birds are dying the fishermen should back away
1636752 in the scheme of things a few injuries may not harm the population
1636753 seniors 06 graffiti spraypainted all over the car made it one of my most memorable moments at the entire school
1636754 when people become so blinded by ideology they commit crimes that trample the rights of their neighbors and put lives in danger the fbi must act
1636755 we hope this reward serves as an incentive to take the often difficult step of bringing important information to the attention of law enforcement
1636756 the whole idea of domestic terrorism is definitely a high priority especially in a case like this where lives were placed in danger
1636757 we hope to glean enough from the video to determine how many people are involved and their basic descriptions to corroborate some leads we have gotten up to today
1636758 we know where you work we know where you live
1636759 that single contribution is more than the rewards we usually offer
1636760 it is gratifying to see the support for identifying and apprehending those responsible for these acts the campus community is encouraged by the seriousness of the response to these acts and the support being shown by law enforcement agencies individuals and the humane society in acting quickly to encourage people with information to step forward
1636761 we wanted to let people know that if you care about the protection of animals you have to care about the protection of people as well
1636762 anyone who would commit these types of horrible crimes is completely at odds with the core principle of the humane movement
1636763 obviously intended to protect people which is a worthy and admirable goal
1636764 i told the kids i couldnt afford to take them anywhere so ill just take them to the boardwalk
1636765 it went up and tilted and the platform opened up halfway and closed again thats when kids started yelling and panicked
1636766 kids were screaming and i reached my arms out and pushed him sebastian away from the flapping ramp as im pulling him toward me i noticed the cage was bent in and the floor was bent underneath him so i held onto him tight
1636767 you could tell it the ride was pretty much out of control and coming apart
1636768 the door itself came apart and went flying over to where the kids were one boy dove out of the way just in time to avoid it crushing him or cutting him in half it was a horrifying event
1636769 accidents happen but im disappointed in the way it was handled
1636770 its been decades since weve had a malfunction that caused an injury
1636771 thats not to say that people dont close the bar on their fingers on rides and things like that but we havent had an injury caused by a ride operator or a ride malfunction in years
1636772 denice grew increasingly troubled during the last months of her life
1636773 she became more and more distant and remote with her friends colleagues and the world around her i continued to do everything within my power to help denice find her way
1636774 had a volatile friendship did not live together and were estranged during the last several months and particularly in the days before denice died
1636775 within the week prior to denices death she was preparing to move back to houston texas
1636776 assuming such agreement or agreements existed neither denice nor kalonji did anything to implement it or them
1636777 kalonji never made denice the beneficiary of any life insurance or retirements benefits nor made her the beneficiary of any will or trust
1636778 i had never made a will either before or during my relationship with denice and to my knowledge during her lifetime neither had she i operated on the assumption that having lived together for a number of years we were common law spouses and would be treated for all purposed as if we had been married
1636779 i think that he had some problems with the terms of allowing animal control unlimited access to his property without warrants and allowing them to trap his dogs
1636780 hes very concerned about his dogs and who has them and where they are
1636781 thats what hes most concerned about is the welfare of his dogs
1636782 the place was a mess and he kept the puppies in a pen that had a shallow pit like dirt bottom
1636783 he had a handful of grown dogs and they were tied up around the property some were pretty aggressive
1636784 we have gone up there before but hes never allowed us on the property
1636785 she is quite sensational any man with blood in his veins would notice that woman
1636786 off guard she was really lovely very easy going and to be honest she was just a pleasure to deal with
1636787 it was tough going at times and the walkers were pushed to their limits
1636788 but the scenery was more that enough to keep us going
1636789 we were so touched by the picture he painted of life in calcutta that it was decided to help michaels charity by taking on the walk i must say it is very heart warming to have so much support in london and back at home for the friends of calcutta charity we cannot thank everybody enough for their generous sponsorship
1636790 we opted for a 40 mile walk to coincide with our 40th annual dinner dance on saturday october 11 we havent as yet decided what well do next year but i can assure you well have something special for our 50th
1636791 i am really honoured i suppose i wouldnt be doing it if i didnt enjoy it but its human nature to enjoy being recognised this is a great club that has kept going through difficult times it gives great satisfaction to see something working to see everything working so well its more than just swimming here its a social thing theres kids coming over to play with other kids adults meeting adults and its a safe environment for children we are very happy with the success of the swimming club
1636792 something like this takes an awful lot of voluntary work and bagenalstown has always been great with that type of thing there has always been great enthusiasm in the town
1636793 when the filter system failed here they helped us out the local engineer gave great help at the time the willingness to help has always been there it came together here when times were tough it would have been easy to throw in the towel but we are grateful for all the help of the council both financially and technically
1636794 it wasnt too bad for the first year when i finished up because i had lots of things to catch up on around the house
1636795 but now im starting to miss the job and the contact with everybody
1636796 we have courses on offer all the time water safety classes and the likes there are a lot of kids around this area who mightnt have learnt how to swim only for the pool
1636797 but now we see young people who learned how to swim here working as lifeguards and saving lives only recently one of our students pulled someone who was in trouble out of the water
1636798 there has been considerable speculation in the national media about the financial viability of many high profile projects all over the country we have found the opposite to be the case with people anxious to know when we will be releasing the next round of share options
1636799 word of mouth is a great thing people have heard about the tremendous work currently underway here far from fearing any economic downturn we see this as an ideal time to show people the true value of a five star championship course which we are currently constructing in bunclody
1636800 anyone who has come to view the work being undertaken here has been bowled over by what were doing we have always welcomed local involvement and perhaps that is what has made this project different from anywhere else in the country
1636801 first and foremost the course and all on site facilities take priority over everything else second the 13 man consortium behind the project are all avid golfers and we will not provide a course of a lesser standard than what we expect to play on ourselves
1636802 this will have a panoramic 360 degree view of the entire course as well as overlooking the mount leinster hills and the slaney valley
1636803 unlike other ventures of this kind money or profit were never the motivating factors yes every project has to pay its way and with that in mind we will be starting work on 20 houses costing from 500 000 upwards later this summer interest in these has been strong and we expect the first of them to be completed in spring 2009
1636804 our intention from the outset was to ensure bunclody and its environs did not lose out on a fantastic amenity that was always the overriding consideration of the 13 man consortium and i believe we have achieved that
1636805 what do you want to be when you grow up

1636808 im glad that he stepped up to this but lets be clear he doesnt have any support in his own party yet for this and unless he can get republicans to agree with his point of view we could be here for an extended period of time
1636809 to change the way how much share of sales an artist can get
1636810 if you can assure the artist deal containing 30 share for cd or physical material sales and 50 share for download sales it could be revolutionary
1636811 and the need to change the old way of thinking that risks crippling the music industry
1636812 all 10 people on board were killed and their bodies are already recovered colonel acra tiproch said from yala
1636813 there are no militants operating near the crash site he said
1636814 unique body style that is not based on any existing model the company said
1636815 this will facilitate the capacity of young people from each country to work and holiday in each others countries he said
1636816 im a very firm believer that schemes like this broaden the understanding of each others cultures
1636817 usually when people are taking a holiday to australia they are only given a tourist visa and cannot work he told reporters
1636818 with this agreement our children who are taking a holiday in australia are able to work in all lines of working fields according to the needs there
1636819 there has been no decision by the australian government to have a guest worker scheme with anyone as yet he said
1636820 while you know there is consideration before cabinet about such matters the focus is very much on the south pacific as a trial
1636821 a decision will be taken and announced shortly about that but the focus has always been on both the south pacific and a trial as part of our attempts to stabilise the south pacific economies
1636822 there has not been any formal engagement with indonesia on those issues senator evans said
1636823 cauterise the lower lakes has infuriated some groups who want the federal government to save the lakes instead by buying more water from upstream irrigators
1636824 there is not enough water in the system to bring down the sorts of quantities of water youd need to fill the lower lakes and to handle the evaporation in the lakes and transmission loss senator wong told abc radio
1636825 even if we did make a decision to not give any allocations upstream there is insufficient water currently in storage less the critical human needs issue for us to viably manage the lower lakes with the amount of water that we have
1636826 do we want to build a weir no mr rann said
1636827 penny wong has waved the white flag on the future of the lower lakes he said
1636828 destroying the freshwater ecology of the lower lakes for a generation a half century or perhaps even a century
1636829 if that action is taken it is a very sad day for how australia has mismanaged the murray darling basin he said
1636830 its a profoundly important decision because the advice i have is once the salt waters in there it is next to impossible to get it out
1636831 sadly its the same iffy logitech control center that ships with the companys mice
1636832 i plan my wednesdays so i dont have to work in the afternoons
1636833 wednesday night is my night out thursday night im packing and friday im at the shore we get here early and just drink water until the drink specials start
1636834 wednesday is the night for people who feel the nightspots dont belong to them on fridays and saturdays
1636835 when i go out on wednesday nights i see people that i know people that im friends with
1636836 its a nice way to get out and reconnect with people
1636837 we are on all the time but at the same time the social barriers are crumbling
1636838 historically weve promoted wednesday night as a late shopping night in philadelphia
1636839 but now its the most exciting night of the week
1636840 in cities like new york miami and chicago the weekends are for amateurs
1636841 i feel guilty for partying and not exploring inner boundaries
1636842 people are just stretched beyond their means at this time
1636843 im voting for the county hospital bonds and the school bonds in my area and thats it
1636844 it will be a low budget campaign and theres not much margin for error
1636845 i think we have to be as cautious as possible to get the best chance of passage
1636846 what weve found running initiative campaigns for more than 20 years is that silicon valley voters are really smart and they vote for what is in their best interest
1636847 i also told the capq community that if i did make a decision i would announce it as soon as i made it so that they knew where i stood the deadline for that decision rapidly approaches since minnesota caucuses on february 5th and i have decided to caucus for mitt romney
1636848 further measures in the autumn to help people with housing
1636849 we have not concluded what exactly we need to do
1636850 we have now reached crisis point in the number of people at risk of repossession and alarm bells must be ringing in the government
1636851 i was fighting against those ideas when you were practicing law and representing your contributor rezko in his slum landlord business in inner city chicago
1636852 something which has never occurred since time immemorial a young woman did not fart in her husbands lap
1636853 this is perhaps one of the most commonly asked questions
1636854 a cursory examination of a flat earth map fairly well explains the reason the north pole is central and antarctica comprises the entire circumference of the earth circumnavigation is a case of travelling in a very broad circle across the surface of the earth
1636855 if youre doing no wrong youve nothing to hide and nothing to fear
1636856 if one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man i would find something in them to have him hanged
1636857 but how often do we in our everyday lives blindly follow instructions without any understanding of what they mean surely these scenarios have their representation in both the mind experiments above
1636858 execution by shooting wont kill the convicts instantly the law states that if the first shot on the heart doesnt work they must be shot again to the head he said
1636859 the executions are one problem and the decision of the constitutional court is another problem there is no relationship human rights minister andi mattalatta said
1636860 it has nothing to do with the execution process the constitutional challenge they filed wont have any effect on the planned execution he said
1636861 it will only have an effect if the constitutional court issues a decision quickly in their favour
1636862 thats part of a mature responsible relationship with the chinese government
1636863 we will always raise our human right concerns with them
1636864 ive done it in the past ive done it privately ive done it publicly ill be doing it at again
1636865 i think its true to say that in the sweep of time over the last quarter of a century the last 30 years china has made substantial improvements
1636866 not just in human rights but in other areas such as trying to spread the economic benefits but it is the case regrettably that we do continue to have very significant concerns
1636867 i think it is important to make this point the olympic games the olympic spirit is an unambiguously good thing for china
1636868 and one of the reasons we were very strong on both raising our concerns about tibet but at the same time saying we didnt see a boycott of the olympics as being in any way useful was because china hosting the olympics is a very good thing for china
1636869 the market has a september rate cut pretty well priced in
1636870 the risk is that they the reserve bank of australia dont go in september
1636871 the market is probably correcting a little bit from the rapid downdraft
1636872 let me say that at the time of the last election i made a mistake in the way the issue was handled
1636873 but can i also say that since the last election water has become the most important issue for australia indeed many parts of the world
1636874 wa unlike other states has the capacity to develop an integrated water supply system to provide water security for this state for another 100 years
1636875 a long term well thought out well costed and considered project
1636876 its time in wa for some genuine big thinking some big thinking some forward thinking because this generation right now is in a unique period of prosperity that weve enjoyed in recent years
1636877 there is a responsibility on this generation to provide for future generations this is the time to do it and water is one of the key issues
1636878 probably been too much too quickly for people to absorb
1636879 in wa we happen to have one of the worlds greatest water resources and we should use that for the state
1636880 in the last 50 years the pilbara has underpinned our development in the mining and resources industries in the next 50 years the kimberley will be just as important
1636881 this has been the iranian strategy for years to bide their time and continue with their enrichment

1636883 you see sponsors see their girls and the girls see them and they burst into tears
1636884 when i opened this store four years ago i had no concept if it would succeed or if it would fail but i wanted to make sure the store did some good
1636885 i thought i need to be an ambassador for these girls nobody was there for them
1636886 our girls have been dependent on their parents and then dependent on their husbands this guarantees that in the future these girls would be independent people
1636887 most girls are the first in their family to finish elementary school
1636888 its a theme other organizations have found educate women and improve lives
1636889 doing this has just made me much more aware that id like to spend the rest of my life being of service
1636890 she knew every detail of my best friends life and it was very touching the level of connection she felt with her sponsor 10 000 miles away
1636891 one morning when the snow was particularly bad i remember pedaling and the bike barely moving
1636892 pedestrians passing me by raised eyebrows and all but i was too stubborn to suck it up and cab it
1636893 but for women there are all those other layers that are implicitly expected hair makeup general put togetherness all of which get thrown off by a windy sweaty or rainy bike ride into the office

1636903 brea has not provided housing for executives we dont have any larger estate lots
1636904 there is some feeling in community that weve lost higher end executives from the community because we dont have that type of housing available
1636905 although the greater part of the land has been zoned for residential development since 1963 most folks think of it as open space
1636906 development would push the wildlife corridor off to the sides will push animals toward olinda village
1636907 you cant have an arrow that says wildlife move here
1636908 whether the corridor will continue to function is up in the air
1636909 there would be no or little restriction on wildlife movement wildlife would be able to use it as they use it today
1636910 dig down to the stable area remove the unstable earth and replace it with compacted soil
1636911 thirty one times the normal particulate matter for over a year isnt all that enticing for those of us that live out here

1636921 senator mccain and senator joe lieberman have a bill pending in congress that unilaterally imposes new high energy costs on u s manufacturers with no safety valve the energy information agency estimated that this bill would raise electric rates by as much as 25 percent and gasoline prices by 68 cents a gallon and the cost in american jobs over 300 000 so it would not only kill jobs it would make it harder for families to make ends meet
1636922 sometimes you have to tell people things they dont want to hear along with things that they do want to hear there are jobs lets have a little straight talk there are some jobs that arent coming back to michigan there are some jobs that wont come back here to south carolina
1636923 now i know that there are some people who dont think that theres a future for the domestic automobile industry they think that the industry and its jobs are gone forever and theyre wrong

1636928 it would be more expensive but there is something to be said for having an international rail link to the continent leaving from birminghams main railway station
1636929 we need to understand how each of the options would work and i will be pressing for as much information as possible to be made public
1636930 greengauge 21 has appointed consultants and we are agreeing a brief for the second stage of consultation which will look at the potential additional benefits for the region
1636931 the economic benefits to birmingham will be billions of pounds and benefiting the financial and business services sectors but also the
1636932 a high speed line would have the additional benefit for birmingham of releasing track capacity for additional local and regional services and this is being looked at over the next few months
1636933 the west midlands rail capacity study has shown that the critically important west coast main line runs out of capacity within 20 years
1636934 it is vital that we start planning now for high speed rail services linking london and the continent with birmingham international and the city centre
1636935 as with all significant projects businesses will be expecting the city to be rigorous in examining whether the proposals pass important principles and there is still a great deal of work to do
1636936 a lot of consumers would think whats the harm in buying some probably cheaper products from markets and so on but it can have a real impact on local traders

1636942 sorry its too big for us our engines must be 2 foot tall and 3 foot long to fit into our current body shells unless you can design me a complete car to accomodate this im not interested your idea is worthless to me
1636943 you dont appreciate what you dont have to pay for

1636945 they are hiring innovators and tasking them with doing things differently
1636946 many companies now have blue sky departments tasked with creating the next big thing but can we factory farm a golden goose
1636947 the teams intimate knowledge of the companys processes and a close coupling to the internal touch points ensures a return but isnt that simply process re engineering rather than innovation
1636948 internal innovation teams focused on process re engineering managing ideas flowing inwards from commercial social frameworks that provide a voice for customers suppliers and everybody else concerned with the business to be heard

1636960 ive known wes for a long time i will tell you the reason he came out of europe early had to do with integrity and character issues things that are very near and dear to my heart im not going to say whether im a republican or a democrat ill just say wes wont get my vote
1636961 i think the greatest condemnation against him came from the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff when he was a nato commander i mean he was fired as a nato commander
1636962 and when hugh shelton said he was fired because of matters of character and integrity that is a very very damning statement which says if thats the case hes not the right man for president as far as im concerned
1636963 were sick of paying the consequences of this war against drugs with thousands killed each year
1636964 i have always been and probably will always be in some way shape or form a working mom
1636965 i used to get up in the morning and go to an office now i get up and go to a plane
1636966 my kids still dont care where i am they just know both parents work in their household and as long as were back for bedtime they could care less
1636967 im lucky because we have the resources and support network including the best my mother who babysits the grandchildren to make sure my kids are taken care of but many families dont which is why the country needs pay equity extended family leave and health care for all americans
1636968 we can work together to make a more mom and family friendly nation and thats why the partnership is so important
1636969 its time for the leaders of this country to fight for the causes of working families every single day whether its extending family and medical leave pay equity or pushing to make sure that finally finally we have a nation where basic health care is not a privilege but is a fundamental right

1637032 i am innocent and i am being targeted this according to me is politics played by shailaja along with the association i wont make such a mistake at all because i dont want to end my career like this
1637033 i have never touched any illegal substance and i have never failed a dope test in my life if all these claims are true i would even go to the extent of ending my life
1637034 she has played dirty politics with me how can the association recommend her name after she has been dope tested positive almost five times i have had 30 tests and all the tests have been negative these are all tactics adopted by the association to forbid me from participating at beijing
1637035 we did not have any sort of intimation on the withdrawal once a members name is given to the olympic association he or she cannot be substituted only she will go and nobody else can go
1637036 we dont have a copy of the report and the air tickets for the games has also not been provided she has been kept away from getting her ticket and all this is unfair on her part
1637037 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1637038 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1637039 visa applications from non accredited persons do not fall within the iocs remit and we are therefore not best placed to answer you on this question
1637040 but its between this government and joey as a private citizen

1637043 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1637044 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1637045 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded center contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1637046 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from m87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1637047 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of m87
1637048 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
1637049 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
1637050 in m87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1637051 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1637052 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1637053 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters center m87 sits at the center of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the center probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
1637054 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time
1637055 the selection of appropriate materials allowing maximum transmission of par photosynthetically active radiation while minimizing materials mass and maximizing longevity under mars conditions is a key element of greenhouse design
1637056 physical stress is one aspect however there are different factors on the surface of mars the effects of which we need to understand uv radiation lower gravity and the atmospheric gases on mars are very different compared to earth
1637057 if we think that we are going to go to mars sometime in the future we must start being realistic about the actual ways people might live there
1637058 this grant allows us to get our feet wet in this critical area of research and more importantly gives us the opportunity to work with some highly skilled

1637064 beard 26 who has posed nude in mens magazines said she decided to participate in the peta campaign because she loved animals and was horrified to see how fur was produced for fashion in some places
1637065 its an important issue im proud to be part of this
1637066 the more ive heard about what happens to the animals fur ripped off them when theyre still alive its heart breaking
1637067 i have seen a lot of the videos and it brings me to tears
1637068 this decision does not affect the eligibility status of the players who have been validly entered by their national olympic committee and who remain fully eligible to compete in olympic games of beijing 2008
1637069 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
1637070 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit
1637071 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are a unique opportunity for a player as they are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1637072 i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1637073 the mens olympic football tournament is for players 23 and under with three exceptions for older players but barcelona messi werder bremen diego and schalke rafinha complained they do not want to lose their players for the start of the season
1637074 cas called upon the goodwill and good sense of fifa and the clubs to find a reasonable solution with regard to players who wish to represent their country in the olympic games
1637075 its a six minute match where its all go and good if you enjoy that contact stuff

1637078 right now theyre trying to figure out why his body rejects transfusions
1637079 i think thats the next step theyre to figure out
1637080 michael lohberg has aplastic anemia in which the bone marrow doesnt produce enough new cells leading to fatigue increased risk of infection and uncontrolled bleeding treatment can involve blood transfusions or a bone marrow transplant
1637081 its nice to be able to talk to him about four days during his treatment i couldnt speak to him
1637082 lohberg also coaches seven other olympians from five countries lonely ride for cancellara swiss time trial world champion fabian cancellara will have to ride the cycling road race on his own after his only teammates olympics came to a sudden end
1637083 theres only the french open and olympic gold thats not on rogers career highlights
1637084 federer who lost in the second round of the athens olympics in 2004 will lose his top ranking to spains rafael nadal on aug 18 a day after the weeklong olympic tennis program ends and 235 weeks after federer assumed no
1637085 in terms of both of them competing there is no doubt that rafa has taken the mantle
1637086 what he did to roger in the french open a straight sets final win i dont think there are to many players on earth that could do that he destroyed him
1637087 to be the first out of the two of them to win the other persons crown at wimbledon on his least favorite surface he truly deserves to be no 1
1637088 there is no doubt he definitely hasnt played as well as he normally does on those u s hard courts
1637089 and you dont normally see him have too many average losses
1637090 hewitt who will be unseeded in beijing after a drop in his ranking due to a chronic hip injury says he could surprise a few players here
1637091 i could draw anyone and if i can get through one or two matches i can only get better
1637092 i just finished hitting out there and it was quite smoggy but it didnt worry me too much
1637093 well definitely be sweating a lot its going to be tough for everyone
1637094 what i show to the general public is obviously the positive side but like you say i am human and this has been a roller coaster ride this isnt flu this is cancer
1637095 how do i keep focused its been pretty easy actually
1637096 a lot of times you can get to events like this like the olympic games and you can put maybe too much pressure on yourself and ive kind of got an out with cancer in that cancers put things in perspective for me
1637097 theres a lot more to life than the olympic games and i think having learned that lesson really quickly has kind of helped keep this whole thing in perspective for me
1637098 hes the guy that i looked to before i even came down with the diagnosis what he did after he was diagnosed and being treated for it you cant help being inspired by that
1637099 and also to know that i will be cured and i will beat this is a pretty inspiring thought too and its not going to control my life
1637100 they help me through the down days it cancer is on my mind constantly i cant help that thats how its got to be
1637101 but with the support i have the people i have in my corner theyre the ones who help me through it
1637102 the way hes handled it has put everything else in perspective for all of us
1637103 i have got to the point where this is just farcical and simply unfair on the athletes who are clean and get there on their own merit
1637104 i have no doubts that when i line up next week i will look left and right and know the other girls arent all clean that is such a disgrace and ive lost all faith in the system because there are so many athletes who are slipping under the radar thats not sport its plain cheating and we need to be vigilant in nailing those who cross the line
1637105 its a joke and again ive lost count of what ive missed out on because of drug cheats
1637106 were still a young culture many of us are first generation americans
1637107 the priorities for my parents werent sports they were to put bread on the table to move ahead and become good american citizens
1637108 outreach programs would make things easier for people less fortunate help the kids who have potential to maybe find the road to the next level
1637109 right now there is no road its bushwhacking your way through to the other side and most of them get lost
1637110 fernando mateo president of the new york based advocacy group hispanics across america says economics is a factor
1637111 the parents dont know their way through the system a lot of the kids cant get scholarships as easily as african americans can
1637112 mateo would like to see targeted investments by foundations and the u
1637113 i need to find out more i dont have all the answers
1637114 we have to do more to take the fine young athletes that exist among new americans and find some ways of creating opportunities for them they are underrepresented
1637115 logan noted hispanic americans are far from monolithic in their sports interests with passions ranging from soccer to baseball to boxing track and field is generally not high on the list yet some athletes from elsewhere in latin america notably cuba have been world champions
1637116 i did have some classmates that were discouraged by parents to play sports and many were very talented
1637117 they would start the season on a sports team and halfway through quit because they couldnt make practice they had to baby sit or run errands for their moms
1637118 she praised the commitment of civic leaders in commerce who have promoted an ambitious and varied youth recreation program indeed the industrial city of 12 500 has a third olympian boxer javier molina
1637119 in commerce more parents now see that their children can represent the u s at the olympics
1637120 the city does a good job of giving their olympians a lot of recognition so residents are forced to become familiar with the olympians and that accessibility gives them hope and encouragement
1637121 more broadly villa said it would help if spanish language tv networks in the u
1637122 the spanish networks need to do their part in exposing hispanic athletes in the nontraditional sports so that parents can see all the options their kids have
1637123 javascript has a single number type internally it is represented as 64 bit floating point the same as javas double unlike most other programming languages there is no separate integer type so 1 and 1 0 are the same value this is significant convenience because problems of overflow in short integers are completely avoided and all you need to know about a number is that it is a number a large class of numeric type errors is avoided
1637124 the byte data type is an 8 bit signed twos complement integer

1637128 women who have endometriosis express this enzyme in both the early and late stages of the menstrual cycle which means that the cells will continue to divide and lose their focus in supporting the establishment of a pregnancy
1637129 as a result the lining of the womb may be more hostile to an early pregnancy and the cells that are shed at this late stage in the menstrual cycle may be more aggressive and more able to survive and implant outside the uterus causing pain in the pelvic or abdomen area
1637130 this is an interesting piece of research which highlights differences between women with endometriosis and those without
1637131 however whilst we welcome any research which increase our understanding of this condition we appreciate that this is still a long way from providing a complete understanding of the condition or indeed new therapies
1637132 we hope that these observations will be developed and improve our understanding and ultimately lead to new treatments
1637133 labour have said over and over that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing
1637134 in countries with good standards of healthcare the possibility for insects or pests to transmit infections in hospitals would be very remote
1637135 in the uk wounds are treated appropriately and dressings applied to ensure good hygiene and prevent infection
1637136 how can patients be safe amid bedbugs fleas and rats these findings reveal what happens when money is taken away from where patients expect to see it spent
1637137 if these hospitals were restaurants they would be closed down and out of business
1637138 clearly it may be necessary to take action against pests in these large public buildings from time to time
1637139 however it is important for hospital trusts to have robust procedures in place to deal with any pest problems
1637140 the hygiene code requires nhs bodies to have a pest control policy that anticipates and manages this issue
1637141 trusts should take rapid action and follow through with surveillance in place to avoid pest incidents and minimize hazards
1637142 use of pest control is a sign of good proactive management

1637144 powerful need for higher value services to support global content value chain strategy for delivering multilingual communications that align with global business goals
1637145 language service providers are uniquely positioned to assist organizations with these services
1637146 gilbanes research confirms that companies acknowledge multilingual communications as an important success factor in corporate business initiatives yet most respondents believe that current efforts are falling short
1637147 many need value added services to help transform the way they achieve their goals language service providers have significant expertise in delivering the needed services especially change management with its long history in localization jonckers is well positioned to address this emerging demand
1637148 jonckers sponsored the new gilbane study along with leaders from all sides of the global content value chain because our global 1000 clients are clamoring for the best practices this study aimed to uncover
1637149 these multinational businesses find they can no longer achieve global market success based on product excellence but instead on brand strength and global customer experience which is grounded in multilingual and multicultural content and data

1637155 for the first time ariane is clearly at risk of decline through a lack of anticipation and strong will
1637156 no one today can seriously question the urgent need to lift the performance of ariane 5 from nine tonnes to 12 tonnes
1637157 the launcher is at the limit of its capacity yet there is no more powerful version under developnment that will be ready to take over in time

1637159 high integrity gps is an effective near term tool that will augment gps satellites to provide critical new capabilities including aggressive levels of additional anti jam protection
1637160 our research concluded that significant low cost improvements to gps can be achieved by using existing signal platforms and systems such as the iridium constellation
1637161 boeing has been working over the years to find new ways to maximize the effectiveness of the gps constellation
1637162 with this integrated approach we can increase the value of the current system by improving its operational mission assurance capabilities

1637179 if you dont think youre smart enough to start a startup doing something technically difficult just write enterprise software enterprise software companies arent technology companies theyre sales companies and sales depends mostly on effort
1637180 what you can do if you have a family and want to start a startup is start a consulting business you can then gradually turn into a product business empirically the chances of pulling that off seem very small youre never going to produce google this way but at least youll never be without an income
1637181 in a good startup you dont get told what to do very much there may be one person whose job title is ceo but till the company has about twelve people no one should be telling anyone what to do thats too inefficient each person should just do what they need to without anyone telling them

1637199 it has been a huge team effort to get to this level and i am delighted with our progress
1637200 however there is more to do if we are to realise the maximum benefits from this discovery
1637201 they produce enzymes that clean wounds they make a wound more alkaline which may slow bacterial growth and finally they produce a range of antibacterial chemicals that stop the bacteria growing
1637202 but the main factor ensuring reproducibility and reliability of the apt system is working with binary packages you can be sure at least of the existence of a binary package and probably that it works due to the severe testing in the debian system there is no guarantee in a source based system hence no package management system can be reliable however sophisticated it is
1637203 the programmer like the poet works only slightly removed from pure thought stuff he builds his castles in the air from air creating by exertion of the imagination few media of creation are so flexible so easy to polish and rework so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures
1637204 we are continuing to grow just not as quickly or as robustly as we had previously expected due to the dramatic decline in the overall north american automotive market which has been impacted by the rapidly escalating price of fuel and the slowing economic activity
1637205 the demand for our products or what the industry calls take rates is still very strong and the vehicle manufacturers remain very enthusiastic about our technology and our seat systems
1637206 while the majority of our revenue still comes from the automotive industry we are moving to a model that is not completely reliant on automotive sales
1637207 thanks to the still largely untapped potential of our thermoelectric technology the future even the near future remains very bright for amerigon
1637208 our thermoelectric technology is becoming more and more efficient particularly as advances are made in the materials we use recent progress has encouraged us to increase our bsst programs for advanced te materials and product development as previously discussed
1637209 the second quarter continued a trend of strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion for our business for the quarter pro forma internal revenue growth was approximately 20 percent compared to the second quarter of 2007 including the effects of all acquisitions in both periods
1637210 our customers continue to invest in infrastructure despite a challenging economic environment the growth in renewable energy generation is creating opportunities and adding momentum to the already strong electrical construction market
1637211 for instance the perception among greek people as being a know it all do it all kind of person can be an advantage when dealing with insufficient information and risk evaluation inherent in management
1637212 the worst is that there appears to be a feedback loop between the way the state is functioning and the peoples minds that makes change very hard
1637213 the neat technology trap avoid using technologies for their own sake every new technology added to a project makes it harder to maintain unless alternative approaches are clearly inadequate adding new technologies is a strategic decision and shouldnt be taken lightly to solve a particular problem
1637214 to use a new technology in the place of an established one it does not just need to be little better than the one i know it needs to be 10 times better in order for me to make the transition
1637215 because the data access tasks are often so tedious we have to ask are the relational data model and especially sql the right choices for persistence in oo applications we answer this question immediately yes there are many reasons why sql databases dominate the computing industry relational database systems are the only proven data management technology and theyre almost always a requirement in any java project
1637216 the demand for nices solutions remains strong in our two market sectors enterprise and security across all regions
1637217 we continue to execute well on our strategy of leading the market with our advanced applications solutions in the enterprise sector and of winning large scale deals in the security sector
1637218 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
1637219 because different types of perchlorate salts have interesting properties that may bear on the way things work on mars if and thats a big if the results from our two teaspoons of soil are representative of all of mars or at least a significant portion of the planet
1637220 the phoenix project has decided to take an unusual step
1637221 we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains of mars
1637222 right now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
1637223 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas we may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt that doesnt release chlorine gas upon heating
1637224 theres nothing in the tega data that contradicts mecas finding of perchlorates
1637225 suppose the executive says that mild torture will help get this information
1637226 its an executive command some systems do that to get information
1637227 these people are missing out on the opportunities choices savings and services that computers and the internet provide neither government policy market forces nor demographic trends are making any significant inroads to bring more people online the report finds
1637228 my husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the california primary somewhere in the middle of june right we all remember bobby kennedy was assassinated in june in california i dont understand it

1637247 hallo hier ist cecilia ich bin jetzt mit richard a zusammen hehe
1637248 its a situation i cant handle you just leave it up to god
1637249 i didnt know anything andrews was always happy always smiling but i feel sorry for him im with him but i dont know whats going on everybody goes through their own little problems
1637250 from a human being standpoint you always wish for the best for others
1637251 you dont want anyone to ever have any kind of mental breakdown like that
1637252 but there are distractions every year at training camp the big thing is not to pay as much attention to it as the media does i mean if you want to feed your family you better worry about yourself and what you are doing first
1637253 the only thing ill say is that i know that coach reid has spent an awful lot of time with that situation ill talk about the players that are in camp here
1637254 that is what replay is going to be there for and replay is coming very soon i cant give you a date but its going to be this year
1637255 there are a lot of factors in replay that i could go on and on about there are a lot of ballparks that are not umpire friendly when it comes to border calls thats how they build them theyre fan friendly and they dont want to change that
1637256 do we like that no but you know what were losing that war so well accept it and well move on and deal with however major league baseball wants us to deal with it and thats about all i can say about it but victorinos line drive is a perfect example of why they want replay
1637257 i look at it now and it looks like it just went foul just missed the pole foul ball after talking to the guys nobody was 100 percent sure one way or the other were not going to flip a call unless weve got it 100 percent
1637258 he goes i dont know i think you missed it but i dont know and he was the closest guy to it
1637259 from a technical standpoint why wouldnt we want to get the play right it seems like we were kind of behind the times and everybody knew what the call was except for the four guys umpires on the field
1637260 the children now love luxury they have bad manners contempt for authority they show disrespect to their elders they no longer rise when elders enter the room they contradict their parents chatter before company gobble up dainties at the table cross their legs and are tyrants over their teachers
1637261 the young people of today think of nothing but themselves they have no reverence for parents or old age they are impatient of all restraint they talk as if they alone knew everything and what passes for wisdom with us is foolishness with them as for girls they are forward immodest and unwomanly in speech behaviour and dress
1637262 we can look at this as a rate increase or we can say that in the past they were undervaluing these mortgages the effect is the same
1637263 with the taxpayers bailing them out fannies loan pricing needs to reflect reality
1637264 it was amazing being down in new orleans and seeing all the philadelphia fans and the amazing outfits they wore

1637295 we are in contact with our embassy to obtain confirmation of the events that appear to be taking place in nouakchott based on initial information it seems that a group of generals are holding the prime minister
1637296 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1637297 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1637298 women particularly mothers can experience considerable strain when attitudes reinforce the notion that employment and family interests conflict
1637299 if we are to make progress in devising policies that encourage equal working opportunities for women we need to know more about what gender roles people view as practical as possible and as fair
1637300 the long working hours culture and lack of flexible working means women are presented with impossible choices forced to choose between caring for a family at home or maximising their career opportunities

1637307 in the absence of a positive response we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive

1637362 park admissions are expected to suffer this summer because of the economic outlook and related deferred investment in new rides and facilities
1637363 while the 25 to 44 year demographic and their kids have typically been the main visitors to theme parks the vast number of baby boomers entering retirement with plenty of spare time and money on their hands must not be neglected
1637364 over the four years to 2012 the 60 plus age group will experience an average annualized growth of 2 8 percent the strongest growth in all age categories
1637365 and theme parks may need to adjust their offering to appeal to older americans and foreign tourists too through shows musical activities and gentler rides

1637419 im sorry my baby daddy loves you but he cant face you
1637420 if only i had an ounce of sense in me that day you would still have a mother to comb your hair in the morning someone to rock you when you are fussy and someone to sing you sweet rhymes to lull you to sleep im sorry you are stuck with me my daughter my baby
1637421 it is true that i am gone but it is not your fault our daughter needs you the most right now and you must stay strong for the both of us show her triple the love the love of a father and the love of a mother and just a bit more because she is our daughter
1637422 you see those those turn into claws at night and it is so dark in order to hide all the blood
1637423 maybe her cart really holds the heads and bones of people
1637424 she only walks the streets in the daytime in order to target her children
1637425 and at night she will go out and kidnap the ones she thinks will taste good
1637426 i heard that she would kill the children and then put their meat inside pork buns
1637427 that is why she has not been caught by the police yet

1637431 the bridge is the heritage of both huntingdon and godmanchester towns and we all want to see it preserved
1637432 each time damage occurs the bridge gets weaker and each time it is repaired there are always reasons why the stonework cannot properly be matched up
1637433 this includes buses and restricting access to cars and motorcycles
1637434 we need to get heavy traffic off it as far as possible and have a pedestrian area which could also be used by bikes
1637435 we are aware of reports of two british nationals being detained near the national stadium in beijing
1637436 we are in touch with the chinese authorities and are requesting immediate consular access should this information be correct
1637437 people have slowed down on the a14 since the average speed cameras were fitted and i think there have been fewer accidents as well
1637438 although many of the accidents on the a1307 are not related to speed many of them are and we have been calling for cameras to be fitted
1637439 we have surveyed peoples views in all the villages along the road and they are supportive of cameras being there
1637440 of course it will be frustrating for people who get caught and motorists are annoyed when they see a camera in a place which is not dangerous
1637441 but on a road where there have been so many lives lost it is clear there need to be lower speed limits and cameras
1637442 i have been caught before and it made me drive more safely it makes you think twice
1637443 the revenue should be kept locally and put into the local highways department for schemes in the area it should not go towards other expenditure
1637444 if you look at the camera in barton for example there are other places in the village that have more problems with speed than where it is
1637445 the money all goes to a central fund and that confirms its a revenue making exercise in my opinion its very sad that we an over taxed population and one that is worried about speed should have a system in place that doesnt address our concerns but just milks us for money
1637446 villages should be allowed to use a radar gun with monitoring i believe that would slow speed through villages very quickly

1637481 in october the state owned industrial and commercial bank of china the worlds richest bank bought a 20 percent stake in south africas standard bank it was the largest foreign investment by a chinese bank in history soon china will surpass the world bank as africas largest lender
1637482 its a bit different in rwanda rwanda isnt rich in oil and minerals like congo or zambia and so the chinese arent coming in droves but they are coming they are coming because the rwandan government has a permanent agent in shenzhen busy selling the idea of rwanda as an investment destination to chinese high tech companies
1637483 hopes that one day some of his phones components will be manufactured in rwanda
1637484 its hard to make money in china these days there is too much competition but africa has only just begun developing its poor here but because its poor youll find the most opportunities
1637485 inked 1 9 billion in new business deals pledged 5 billion in aid and loans and promised to double aid to africa by 2009 trade between china and africa has nearly quadrupled in the last six years jumping from 10 8 billion in 2000 to nearly 56 billion in 2006 making china the continents third largest trading partner chinas goal is for trade to reach 100 billion by 2010

1637503 she always wanted to do her best and i dont think it had anything to do with outdoing someone else its within her
1637504 people associate her with jackie kennedy because thats the last time there was a first lady with a trademark style

1637508 i wouldnt say any bad things about bill i think he did good things for the british team at the grassroots level and i think we are getting some positive and good results off the back of that

1637522 stoller crop health therapy considers the factors that impact a plants growth cycle and works to maximize genetic expression while nullifying the impact of stress issues our products focus on how to maximize the performance of plants to maximize profits for growers it must seem to farmers that everyone is out to take some of their money at stollerusa we want to put some money back in the farmers pockets

1637536 the number one referral for contributions from the frontlines came from intermarkets promotions on the drudge report
1637537 the total is going much much higher mostly because of intermarkets generosity and expertise in placing advertisements for us on the web

1637551 we are auctioning quality properties for highly motivated sellers including everything from waterfront homes on charlotte harbor to homes located on golf course or featuring lake access the surplus of property already for sale in florida prompted our sellers to liquidate their real estate holdings through auction a method of real estate marketing that provides an efficient means to turn non producing assets back into cash flow
1637552 the trend to move multiple properties through auction marketing is growing
1637553 selling real estate in todays market can be challenging and the auction method is a viable alternative to just sticking a sign on your property it provides immediate results maintains control of the sale process and establishes a competitive selling price
1637554 the current buyers market combined with the accelerated buying process offered by auctions makes these events ideal for consumers however many potential buyers feel intimidated by multi property auctions
1637555 some people feel that these events only benefit real estate investors who have the ability to pay cash but united countrys multi property auctions make it possible for average buyers to identify and purchase their dream properties with confidence
1637556 what makes our auction process different is our goal of finding the right buyer for each property at the accurate market price our mission is to unite these buyers and sellers to initiate transactions with mutual rewards financing options and home warranties also provide services to support our goal
1637557 each year millions of u s citizens lose billions of dollars in what would seem to be and endless array of one wall street scam after another the auction rate securities debacle is just one very good example investors of any type who feel like they have been cheated by a wall street type stock brokerage firm or bank investment adviser now have a place to call and a free service designed to help get the investor their money back
1637558 we had no idea how big a problem this all was until we waded into the auction rate securities 330 billion disaster we had no idea that the sec or most state regulators are basically worthless when it comes to actually recovering investors money we had no idea that on average only 1 in 10 investors gets their money back from a wall street type scam like the auction rate securities flim flam
1637559 thousands of californians were cheated and defrauded out of billions of dollars with auction rate securities if you cannot do the job as ag resign
1637560 if a big new york bank really did destroy auction rate securities records why didnt you arrest them isnt that called obstruction of justice
1637561 because of a concentration in this risky industry substantial losses have been suffered
1637562 the wall street fraud watchdog was created to assist cheated consumers or investors who were defrauded by a wall street stock brokerage firm or bank financial services investment scheme it is designed to guide bilked investors into the best available legal paths available to recover their money and this service is free to cheated us consumers or investors there is no service like this in the world
1637563 we are going to make it much much harder for a wall street stock broker or bank to take advantage of anyone and not pay dearly for it
1637564 mr george is relieved to finally have a happy ending to this horrible chapter in his life he has spent eight years in prison as an innocent man while the real murderer has walked free thankfully the appeal system has worked by allowing him to redeem his good name i can only hope that the police catch the person responsible for ms dandos murder so her family can finally have closure
1637565 the tool is especially helpful if you are moving to a new area and would like to get an idea of home prices in various parts of the city
1637566 in recent months we have seen a significant increase in home improvement personal loan requests for the last decade homeowners have been able to sit back and rely on rising property prices to increase the equity in their home but sadly this is no longer possible if you want to trade up and avoid substantially increasing your mortgage youll need to add value to the house youre currently in
1637567 the current cooling of the property market is making homeowners think twice about selling up and many are opting to improve instead in a buoyant market people taking on a home improvement project could get away with less than perfect preparation or some slapdash sums as their mistakes were covered by rising property prices however in todays environment it is vital you plan any project thoroughly to ensure maximum return on investment
1637568 whether the motivation is a quick sale adding long term value or accommodating changing lifestyle needs its vital homeowners consider the financial investment theyre about to make a personal loan can provide a hassle free affordable way of spreading the cost

1637570 rekaman itu terlalu sempurna untuk dibilang tidak asli kalau ada yang bilang itu tidak asli ya mungkin kasetnya yang tidak asli tapi percakapannya saya percaya itu benar terjadi sebelum adamair celaka
1637571 ini sama sekali bukan human error buktinya selama lima menit terakhir ada percakapan antara pilot dan kopilot serta petugas pemandu dari atc air traffict controller di ujung pandang untuk menerbangkan pesawat secara benar
1637572 ketiga tiganya setelah diselidiki ternyata ada masalah pada rudder jadi kejadian silk air juga bukan karena pilotnya ingin bunuh diri seperti yang disimpulkan knkt tapi karena ada masalah pada pesawat hal ini juga dibuktikan dengan serpihan ujung sayap yang ditemukan 30 km dari tkp yang membuktikan ujung sayap lepas duluan di atas
1637573 dengan kemiringan dan kecepatan tersebut lalu tindakan pilot ingin mengurangi kecepatan justru membuat pesawat kehilangan kendali dan menukik ke bawah
1637574 ada kemiripan tapi itu belum tentu otentik bisa jadi itu berasal dari sumber sumber yang tidak bisa dipercaya
1637575 untuk kasus adamair kan sudah selesai knkt sudah melakukan investigasi memprosesnya lalu kesimpulannya dan rekomendasi jadi itu yang dipakai sekarang tidak perlu dikaitkan dengan rekaman yang beredar itulah
1637576 saya minta dengan segala hormat agar rekaman tersebut tidak disebarluaskan sekali lagi karena tanpa bukti lain yang telah berhasil dikumpulkan pakar pakar teknologi penerbangan di knkt dan menganalisa rekaman tidak orisinil tanpa bukti yang lain dapat menyesatkan

1637578 the influence is still there that they want it to happen they probably themselves dont have a day set to do it but theyre waiting for an opportunity and something will come along
1637579 the sad part is a lot of people wont be surprised its tragic its sad all we have to do is have one our ships hit and a bunch of americans killed and one or two news stations say it was the iranians and the countrys going to be ready to go to war theyd even be willing to call a draft to say we have to go to save israel we have to march in so we need a draft thats the worst part that i fear
1637580 contrived gulf of tonkin style incident that may well occur to gain popular support for an attack on iran
1637581 it is still totally bewildering to me when i see men and women in the congress that i know and like doing this just to get along
1637582 i agree with you on all you say but the iranians are bad people and they might attack us some day i hear members of congress saying if we could only nuke them

1637586 the concern was that 2008 would be less than a banner year because of questions and challenges in areas such as fuel prices and the economy but it turned out to be an overwhelming week each day on the grounds was filled with outstanding activities that made every day at airventure a unique event in itself this years oshkosh was the shot of enthusiasm inspiration and economic boost that aviation needed

1637591 i wish i could take that same edge when i go over there with a bat in my hand
1637592 i hope that we can get where we get everybody back where it doesnt matter that much
1637593 i think whats going to get me back in the starting lineup is hitting more balls hard and keeping it out of the air and starting to get hits and contributing to this club offensively rather than on just one side of the ball

1637599 i didnt actually go out and change the way i played i didnt think i had to change the way i played because it was test cricket
1637600 at that time the sri lankans were too good for me it just didnt go the way i imagined it to go and it was because of good pieces of bowling sometimes and other times my own error
1637601 i am not jose mourinho so why compare me with him mourinho says i will win 10 championships but i am more modest than that
1637602 i am from south brazil and in my culture we never say i will win this or that i just say that i will try my best to win all the competitions
1637603 since i came to chelsea we have only spent 8million on deco jose bosingwa came in before i arrived
1637604 maybe in the past they have spent more money but now they dont need to spend as much because they already have a solid base now they need a coach to develop young players and i think i am that coach
1637605 obviously the last couple of weeks has put me in a slightly different position than what i was four weeks ago so yeah i understand that im 20 000 euros behind justin and about 25 world ranking points out of position on the world list
1637606 theres no point looking at it any more i understand where i am and i understand that these four days coming up are going to be very important
1637607 i just know what ive got to do i can only do what i can do and that is play good golf this week if i play well ill be in the side
1637608 if i play solid for the next four tournaments that im going to play if im not in the side im sure going to have a chance to be getting a pick thats what i do know
1637609 isaia is currently at full back for auckland and has played there previously at the international and the super 14 level
1637610 hes also got the ability to play elsewhere in the backline which is helpful when we are a long way from home
1637611 hell gradually get back into exercise and then training and then may look to play an air new zealand cup match for canterbury
1637612 but of course the allegations and certain things that happened were not nice i just hope they learn from it and they will be part of the italian elite again
1637613 maybe it did not end the way i wanted but it was a great experience
1637614 i never played to my full potential it was my first time abroad and juventus played quite differently to the way we played at ajax
1637615 i had to get used to a lot of different things and although i was able to speak the language in about three months sometimes on the pitch i was half a second late shouting something and the moment had gone which was unfortunate
1637616 a lot of people say that i should have gone to united instead but i had already had two meetings with juventus before united came in

1637670 this is not like spike lee vs tnns spike tv plan in 2003
1637671 in that case you had a single person able to hold an entire multimillion dollar company hostage so that it lost millions just waiting for the case to be heard you also had an open intent by the company to invoke the image of spike lee among others heaths mother came up with the name snooptunes and she strongly dislikes rap music she had no intention of invoking a gangsta image for her teenage daughters product moreover there is no economic hostage opportunity for dogg we are talking about a start up that needs capital to grow not a company with coffers to pay off frivolous lawsuits just to avoid the cost of fighting this case will have to be resolved on the basis of its legal merits and though i am not an attorney i do not believe he is in the position of power on that subject

1637680 sikorsky aircraft has the longest and most successful record of any helicopter company in history when it comes to combat search and rescue starting in 1944 with the r 4 aircraft and continuing with the h 53 family
1637681 we are proud that the air force has recognized this legacy with the induction of this aircraft
1637682 the h 92 helicopter is the culmination of all weve learned about combat search and rescue technology since world war ii which comprises an immense amount of knowledge and experience
1637683 the h 53 fleet has logged countless combat hours flown in every contingency in the last 40 years and met the needs of national objectives time and time again
1637684 the machines have seen a couple of generations of these people come and go and always they remain the enduring posture to respond to the nations call when needed
1637685 the distinguished record of the fleet is a testament to the people behind the aircraft the designers and engineers who developed the proven and reliable technology the people who worked the line constructing the fleet and the crews who have maintained it
1637686 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
1637687 because different types of perchlorate salts have interesting properties that may bear on the way things work on mars if and thats a big if the results from our two teaspoons of soil are representative of all of mars or at least a significant portion of the planet
1637688 the phoenix project has decided to take an unusual step
1637689 we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains of mars
1637690 right now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
1637691 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas we may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt that doesnt release chlorine gas upon heating
1637692 theres nothing in the tega data that contradicts mecas finding of perchlorates
1637693 this auction will allow us to implement market mechanisms on a small scale gauge interest and determine a slots market value however the real winners in this auction will be consumers who stand to benefit from more reliable air service that costs less in terms of both time and money

1637695 the concern was that 2008 would be less than a banner year because of questions and challenges in areas such as fuel prices and the economy but it turned out to be an overwhelming week each day on the grounds was filled with outstanding activities that made every day at airventure a unique event in itself this years oshkosh was the shot of enthusiasm inspiration and economic boost that aviation needed
1637696 i still dont know what makes me so fast and so successful

1637702 i think the biggest rival in beijing will be myself but i really dont want to think about it
1637703 i honestly do not know if i can ever be the same runner again
1637704 but mind you if there is any person on the planet who is capable it is him
1637705 i think im getting every ounce i can out of these guys at the moment
1637706 the clock is ticking and i know the window shuts on aug 15th im crying out for top players to come into the club
1637707 i wish i could have said it was ronaldinho and lionel messi
1637708 i got a kick out of my mii because it looks like he has a lot of fun on the pitch and hes capable of pulling off some wild moves
1637709 under my watch nasa will inspire the world make america stronger and help grow the economy here in florida
1637710 barack obama once again demonstrated that his words really dont matter
1637711 we have to beat them so i dont have to move we lose to hamilton again im never going to hear the end of it
1637712 aunts uncles friends neighbours over the fence in the tim hortons its oskee wee wee stuff like that all the time
1637713 the only place theres a rivalry is in the media
1637714 theres no real rivalry for us now montreal maybe is as close as it gets because of us playing them in the finals a lot of years
1637715 its just the guys in the first four rows but they berate you call you every name in the book
1637716 they spit at you and throw things at you doesnt really matter though
1637717 do your helmet up and dont stand next to oshea
1637718 way back in my first stint with the argos there was this sign two jerks from north bay mikes harris then ontario premier and oshea
1637719 they love you or hate you and thats the type of place you want to play a hostile environment
1637720 for me i expect it ive got a reputation for being that type of player sometimes
1637721 the hamilton offensive linemen are among the best holding linemen in the league
1637722 some people get caught up with the patriotism aspect of it but im going to enjoy it and do the best i can to represent russia
1637723 i love our country i love what we stand for this is an opportunity to fulfil my dream of playing in the olympics
1637724 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1637725 mike and i both agreed monday night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1637726 this entire case rests upon the statement of adam pacman jones
1637727 this is rocket science if we knew how to do it it wouldnt be exploration
1637728 they also unfurled a snow lion flag the tibetan independence flag
1637729 china has focused on strengthening security and protection around olympic venues and at the olympics village so beijing is already prepared to respond to any threat
1637730 they predicted it was more likely that we would see an attack in far away remote towns where there is less of a security presence
1637731 they found nine homemade bombs inside the vehicle that was used to ram into the police
1637732 they also found a homemade gun as well as propaganda material similar to the jihadist material they found during a previous raid on east turkistan islamic movement groups
1637733 the latino community should not have to worry that their legitimately earned wages and dreams of building a home and better life can be taken away on a whim

1637748 the guys are fit we have had six or seven games and they have plenty of minutes under their belts
1637749 time travel has been a fascination of many tv shows and films have been made on this topic and are usually quite entertaining this topic came up yesterday to me from 2 individuals so i will give you some information time travel is a complex subject as it involves not only moving through time but also the intricacies of the game the game is a huge jigsaw puzzle it is a common misconception to believe that if you have a few pieces of the puzzle that you have the entire picture time travel involves just a few pieces of the puzzle in the back to the future trilogy of movies doc brown creates a device that can physically move people through time and undo events that they are uncomfortable with and thereby create a reality that favors their positions while very interesting to watch it just isnt possible to do these things time travel is a reality in matrix 5 i mention how i learned basic astral travel and in that course astral time travel is discussed and assignments are given to travel back to 1600 and forward to 2200 refer back to m5 for those details as well as which book teachers i had astral time travel is the fastest way to zip around through time periods you leave your body use the techniques given although i altered them to fit what works best for me and you just appear where you want to be you can observe things going on but cannot change what you see remember time is an illusion earther higher selves are simultaneous incarnates and you exist in all frequencies chosen by your higher self for the experiences shim wants our present is another frequencys past or future some say that the future isnt here yet but that isnt quite correct its a matter of perspective the higher self is a being of exceptional power and ability however much of this ability is held in check by your higher self when your higher self agrees to participate in the game this refers to both simultaneous and sequential incarnating beings the games rules do not include changing the rules by using your abilities the restrictions of the game take precedence in the 3rd density in certain instances the higher self can intervene as per earlier m5 segments to ensure that the incarnations pre chosen path goals are met and not circumvented by other game players time travel whereby one or a group decides to mold events to fit their agendas is a violation of game rules such an action would interfere with experiential choices and is motivated by the body rather than by the spirit in back to the future marty mcfly wanted his familys experiences to be different than what they chose by going into the past he altered events to make his familys path totally different you cant do that this would have interfered with the experiential choices of several higher selves to fall under the desires of one this is a lightsider power play the i know whats best for you ploy moving away from fictional films theres the montauk series of events and their time travels the montauk project was built with heavy alien activity and instruction if you dont recall what ive written on alien sequential incarnates attempts to hinder simultaneous incarnates as part of the game refer back to earlier m5 segments beware of aliens bearing gifts they most likely have an a hidden agenda that certain aliens wanted the dark government of the us to have this technology should say something in and of itself it wasnt made available to everyone or even the knowledge of it made public nope the aliens as usual go slinking slithering around in the dark to attempt to manipulate obstruct the developments of earther higher self incarnates with the assistance of darksiders on earth the montauk project is wrapped in tragedies murders and more that alone tags it as a dark event mind controls interdimensional tamperings and others have invited trouble to earth the 20 year loop event caused by the montauk experiment the rift is real and a bi product of the experiment have you heard of the aliens who were responsible for this technology returning to repair the damage their interference caused of course not therefore one has to question their intent the rift would not exist if the damage was repaired on the other hand the rift couldnt exist if it was not part of the game again beware of aliens bearing gifts there is an excellent source of montauk materials in books by preston nichols and peter moon available through sky books on long island ny start with the montauk project experiments in time if youre interested in this topic ive read the whole series and find it quite interesting a huge amount of deception and paranoia is depicted by the controllers of the technology paranoia and deception are common among dark workers who fear losing their control that should indicate how tenuous their hold is lets not even get into the montauk monster fiasco in the media one thing to remember in reading time travel stories is that you cannot go back in time to kill anyone to change history if this were possible history would constantly be changing for all the time travelers wandering around being like marty mcfly for everyone who wants future cc theres another who doesnt want that but rather future mm and then someone else who wants future ww and on it goes time travel can be excellent for observing first hand how something was the body oriented would say why dont you see what next weeks lottery numbers are so you could be rich geez ive been asked that question enough your higher self is in control of at what stage you are able to start conscious astral travel if you cant do it yet take it up with your higher self if you can your higher self requires that talent for that incarnation astral travel requires a certain stage of spiritual maturity astral time travel requires even more next year august 12 03 is the next 20 year date for the time loop created by the disastrous montauk project the loop event was created on aug 12 1943 when things just seemed to go wrong again i point out the alien connection and set up for this to happen you also didnt see any so called good aliens with their advanced technologies step in to undo the damage once more beware of aliens bearing gifts this energy rift seems to peak every 20 years from the 43 date as it is ive written that 2003 looks like itll be the year from hell add this event to the pot there is one thing i would like you all to remember though this is part of the game something to this magnitude would not be allowed in the game if it were not part of it you need more pieces of the puzzle to see it better i find it interesting that in the latest claims by the andromedans is that they use that date aug 12 03 as the deadline they set for driving all aliens off earth theres a connection here i advise you take whatever the andromedans or their lackeys say with more than just a grain of salt remember the mass fly over of andromedan ships that were going to happen a couple summers ago it seems that all aliens just get their jollies from seeing what earthers will believe next they all have their agendas one of the major byproducts of the montauk project is the generation of fear which is why the dark side allows printing materials of it they want you to generate fear feel threatened and give your power away to dark authorities for external protection there is nothing to be in fear about when you know and trust in your higher self that is the key for each earther higher self with the gold shield and trust in your higher self you know youre immortal and its the body that tries to get you to fear who created the bodies we have those damned fucking aliens it can seem that the aliens have their claws paws and hands all over in the game yes these are other pieces of the puzzle they fear you discovering who you really are the montauk project is just another of their tools for that the puzzle however will not be completed for you until your final

1637765 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1637766 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1637767 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights

1637777 there is not a single sign of an unmanageable flood of traffic if anything a slowdown is visible more than a speedup this suggests that the industry might benefit from shifting its emphasis towards methods of stimulating traffic growth
1637778 now annual traffic growth rates of 50 percent when combined with cost declines on the order of 33 percent result in no net increase in costs to provide the increased transmission capacity
1637779 in a competitive environment that means no increase in revenues which is hardly a cheering prospect for the industry if traffic growth could be pushed back towards 100 percent where it used to be for many years we would have pressure for increased revenues and also for new technologies

1637796 we got kicked in the teeth over john bostock and all the big clubs already know who they want from us because theyve been watching them for months
1637797 it brings a smile to my face when you hear people from big clubs like sir alex ferguson and levy having a go about alleged tapping up and underhand behaviour
1637798 theres a 14 year old in our academy who has already been tapped up by agents and big clubs im sure its also happening with 11 and 12 year olds so its vital the laws change
1637799 officially we cant talk to players about professional contract until theyre 16 but in reality most of the deals with other clubs are sealed well before then

1637850 universities can reach out but they have to reach out to everyone
1637851 were focusing on students with low income and disadvantaged backgrounds
1637852 last year there were 10 counties from california that did not send a single student to berkeley ten
1637853 there is some additional flexibility afforded to students in terms of their outreach and how they design outreach
1637854 we call the schools and get the demographics of how many african americans go to that school then we put together thousands of packets with fliers like an introduction to the university financial aid how to write essays
1637855 we go to the classes that have never heard of berkeley before
1637856 they are passionate about what theyre doing because they care
1637857 the students have seen the need for greater diversity and have taken it upon themselves to assist and supplement the universitys effort

1637878 while others have linked agent orange to cancers such as soft tissue sarcomas hodgkins disease and lymphoma there is limited evidence so far associating it with prostate cancer
1637879 here we report on the largest study to date of vietnam war veterans exposed to agent orange and the incidence of prostate cancer
1637880 our countrys veterans deserve the best possible health care and this study clearly confirms that agent orange exposure during service in vietnam is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer later in life
1637881 just as those with a family history of prostate cancer or who are of african american heritage are screened more frequently so too should men with agent orange exposure be given priority consideration for all the screening and diagnostic tools we have at our disposal in the hopes of early detection and treatment of this disease
1637882 we are aggressively targeting new to silversea and first time cruisers by going after a larger share of the lucrative baby boomer market
1637883 the top segment of the market is looking for a boutique environment top levels of service and the unique destinations silversea caters exactly to this desire with smaller ships giving passengers more space a high staff to guest ratio and ships that can easily dock in off the beaten track destinations or normally inaccessible ports like london tower bridge ho chi minh city and the harbour in monaco we hold a unique place in the market for boutique luxury rather like aman does in the hotel sector
1637884 we have been successful in attracting guests who are new to cruising by broadening our distribution base to include more travel agents who have an established luxury travel clientele we are far ahead of where we were in 2007 for the region both in terms of sales and yields our forward sales are approximately 70 ahead of last year week on week 2007 compared to 2008 the asia pacific region now represents over 15 of all silversea passengers worldwide
1637885 at a time when some airlines are cutting routes and downsizing capacity airasia is breaking the trend with our expansion plans adding services where there is proven demand which there certainly is for the hong kong route
1637886 in the current economic climate corporate organisations are doing all they can to reduce their controllable spending such as air travel we are looking at creating demand at the lowest possible fares corporate travellers will now have smarter alternative travelling choices to fly low cost and at the same time given choices of pre booking hot meals online xpress boarding and other value added services offered via our seamless online booking

1637892 this is not an end of the season fun race for us this is a serious objective for our team its a major event
1637893 athletes from around the world will come to race in missouri
1637894 last year they experienced great weather great crowds and were welcomed by big and small cities alike we look forward to playing host to them all again in september
1637895 without doubt this is a deeper field than last year
1637896 we have three teams that played major roles at the tour de france this year we have all the top clubs in north america and two top european continental teams that will surely be hungry it is an interesting and talented mix
1637897 the way the course is designed it will take a very high caliber athlete to win we could see a few more lead changes than last year with three top teams from the tour de france and all the top teams in north america there will be a lot of good wheels to follow
1637898 this event proved in only its first year to be hugely successful for all involved most importantly the great host communities of the tour
1637899 it was very successful for the state as a tourism vehicle as people from 73 countries caught part of the event via live webcasts and people from 21 states came into missouri to see the event

1637917 the district courts decision if upheld would have dangerous repercussions far beyond this single case
1637918 that court opinion holding that the secret and unauthorized copying and forwarding of emails while they pass through an email server is not an illegal interception of those emails threatens to wholly eviscerate federal privacy protections against internet wiretapping and to authorize the government to conduct similar email surveillance without getting a wiretapping order from a judge
1637919 location information collected by cell phone companies can provide an extraordinarily invasive glimpse into the private lives of cell phone users courts have the right under statute and the duty under the fourth amendment to demand that the government obtain a search warrant based on probable cause before seizing such sensitive information
1637920 this is only the latest of many cases where eff has been invited to brief judges considering secret surveillance requests that arent supported by probable cause we hope this court recognizes the serious fourth amendment questions that are raised by warrantless access to cell phone location information and affirms the magistrates denial of the governments surveillance request
1637921 its a case of just doing what weve always been doing and doing that well
1637922 for me its just a case of coordinating the expertise which is already in the team gary would give his expert input and receive input from the players and even though hes not here there are other experts
1637923 every game is critical in test cricket we know its 1 1 and we know how important it is the players dont need too many reminders whether we win or lose the toss our preparation is the same we focus around what needs to happen to win were happy to take the consideration of the toss out of the picture
1637924 there are no major injuries but we dont want to take any risks we will take the decision about the final squad after watching thursdays practice match at mirpur
1637925 darryl lifson the national team physio believes rahims injury picked up during fielding against south africa in the last three day match was minor
1637926 mortaza also seems to be getting better as he bowled six overs on tuesday the mri reports have also suggested there was no reason to be worried with his injury
1637927 except tamim iqbal nobody scored runs in the opening slot which is a big problem
1637928 we tried a few players in the opening spot but none have impressed
1637929 given the widespread enthusiasm for this years opening ceremony combined with the highly auspicious date 8 august 2008 at 8 00 p m marking the start of the beijing 2008 olympic games this is certain to be a curtain raiser like no other a few weeks ago those passing by the national stadium were treated to a small glimpse of what to expect when fireworks lit up the night sky one can only imagine what well see in two days time
1637930 viva macau airlines is the only airline flying visitors from ho chi minh city and jakarta directly to macau this festival will allow them to know more about macau and to create a new travel trend of visiting macau

1637934 as one of the worlds premier tourist destinations this island paradise has the potential to become a leading international venue for conventions and expos
1637935 the launch of the royal phuket marina exhibition amp conference centre is an important milestone for royal phuket marina as we continue to contribute to the social and economic fabric of the phuket community
1637936 phukets economy is booming tourism is at an all time high and the island is a natural magnet for growing international demand for conventions and exhibitions im confident that phuket will be placed firmly on the international convention and exhibition map
1637937 we are really excited about the future of the marine industry in the region and we hope that our experience and considerable network will propel pimex to new heights and ensure that it is positioned to serve all aspects of this rapidly growing market

1637947 can you all get me a nike shoes for bday size 8 white color plsssss
1637948 everyone needs to get together and find one solution that is to have one big tournament where you get all the revenue and all cricket playing countries to share that
1637949 at the end of the day everything is driven by money
1637950 you have to be honest with yourself that means the players the administrators everybody as long as everyone is happy and gets to share that i think thats the way forward thats where everyone has to draw a compromise
1637951 you need to strike a balance because they cannot compete with each other on these issues
1637952 it is important that you sit down and everyone gets together and finds one big solution that is to have one big tournament where you get all the revenue and cricket playing countries to share that
1637953 if you have one big tournament and the revenue is being shared then everyones happy
1637954 you wont need to play five individual tournaments then theres room for test cricket and you can pump in money and develop the game and take it globally thats where the compromise needs to be drawn and everyone gets together to find a solution
1637955 thats difficult for me to say after one year of the ipl i dont know how big the english premier league epl or the stanford games are going to be but somewhere you have to draw the line you have people competing against each other and taking international cricket apart its important to understand where you need to draw that line
1637956 the times and ways of thinking are changing and you need to evolve around that twenty20 is good for the game as long as people keep control of things
1637957 you cant have three or four twenty20 international tournaments a year you just cant have that it has to be controlled tests are very important one day cricket is important you cant think that everybody wants twenty20 cricket everyone wants cricket but they want different varieties and there is a demand for everything
1637958 kevin will bring kevin pietersen which is crucial hell be his own man and thats going to be really important
1637959 coaches and captains are always going to have different views because they look at the game from a different angle
1637960 but ive always found kevin fine what i like about him is that hes got his views which can be pretty forthright one of the first things i wanted to do when we were going to offer him the captaincy was to sit down and talk to him about where he was coming from and what his views were and whether they matched mine by the end we both felt very confident that we were coming from the same place
1637961 hell be different to michael vaughan because hes a different man
1637962 michael had his style and that was very successful kevin will bring kevin pietersen which is crucial hell be his own man and thats going to be really important whats really promising is that the senior arm of the team is going to get behind him
1637963 your coaching style changes with different people but your coaching philosophy doesnt change all that much
1637964 i dont particularly see my views on the game changing the coachs job is to try to take pressure off the captain
1637965 whats his vision going to be i guess all those things will be answered in the next year or so we can only wish him well from after the oval test match and well watch with interest how it all unfolds
1637966 our vision is to establish one of the best independent 5 star hotels in china and we work closely with the local tourism authority to ensure our guests receive a most memorable experience in xian
1637967 this game is big for everyone winning this game is big for everyone here
1637968 you dont want to give anyone a free pass especially when you have a lead like that
1637969 if wed have played a little defense hed be out of it
1637970 me getting the save is about as big a highlight as me eating the 1 000th cheesesteak served in the visiting clubhouse in philadelphia
1637971 thats about where it ranks right guy at the right place
1637972 its probably a good thing that we continue to show life in the second half of the game
1637973 the mets are a good team at the end you just want to be in a position to win a ballgame
1637974 its my second start in almost two months and certainly im lucky to be out there
1637975 our state faces too many new challenges to settle for the old politics
1637976 i dont know whether it has anything to do with the heat
1637977 now were hoping for 25 percent and its dropping every hour
1637978 we usually have two times that number by this point
1637979 when i talked to jacob he said he was so scared he thought he was going to die
1637980 he said when the tiger started biting me i kept punching it in the head
1637981 the law may allow them to operate but at some point we have to take initiative to regulate them beyond what the state of missouri does
1637982 now the thought has to be any time a cat wants to hop the fence and get to you he can
1637983 if theyre going to operate that kind of facility they have a moral and ethical responsibility to the citizens to be honest
1637984 we had received a number of complaints about this facility
1637985 i do think its telling that they had to go back to 1994 and to texas to find a case to name their law after
1637986 the point is that bad things happen to girls who have secret abortions
1637987 the opposition cannot show that a single girl has ever been harmed by a parental notification law
1637988 i am twenty years old and am in college right now to be a preschool teacher i love kids have always babysat and would love to work with infants
1637989 goldie loves everyone and all other dogs and yes even cats i only wish i was as always as good natured and happy as she is
1637990 when he wants to take a bath he will go into his water dish and spray me with water until i get up and get him his regular bowl that he uses for his bath
1637991 chance had a rough start and a long road to recovery but after a few visits to the vet some medicine and tons of love he grew into a beautiful strong dog
1637992 molly and i play every day she likes to play with the mice i got her and she love her kitty condo that my husband made in his workshop

1638030 two defeats is not the way i envisaged coming back with england i didnt wait 18 months to get beaten
1638031 it wasnt ideal but in a perverse way the first one at headingley i enjoyed in the sense of being back around the lads playing in front of a big crowd and playing for england
1638032 i just wish the outcome had been slightly different because for six months ive had to work so hard to get back in the side i am enjoying being there
1638033 ive had a start ive bowled some overs and ive batted okay but now i need to start performing properly
1638034 before this ankle operation i thought if i didnt think i could recapture the form of previously i wouldnt have put myself up for all of this
1638035 i feel i can do that i feel i am getting there but i can rattle on as much as i can about it ive got to start doing it out on the field
1638036 people go on about the ashes next year weve got thursday to concentrate on weve got beaten twice by south africa and weve got to pull it around a bit
1638037 it is not a dead rubber maybe it is in the context of the series but we are playing for england and we are certainly playing for pride it is not measured by a trophy or a cheque there is a lot for us to play for as cricketers
1638038 for a start weve got to score more runs in the first innings of a test match than we have in the last two to give ourselves a decent chance
1638039 as a group of players weve got to perform weve got to put some pressure on south africa

1638042 were hoping that councillors will be prepared to work with the community and talk with the community a lot more
1638043 if council and the community work together then you can get innovative development happening and thats a good outcome for all
1638044 we need to identify infrastructure needs like halls play areas for kids shops all the sorts of things that make thriving local community
1638045 if you have a whole lot of houses close together its not conducive to the local environment
1638046 it was all their own work they wrote the scripts came up with all the concepts made the sets costumes acted in it composed and played the music and filmed it
1638047 they did it all and im so proud of them it was the culmination of all the effort they had put in for over a year almost every day there were at least 500 people in that hall and they all seemed to enjoy it tremendously
1638048 we have had so many requests for an evening performance that we are hoping to put one on later in the year
1638049 red inc drama teacher jess clingan dixon transposed their dreams into a magnificent performance
1638050 the nomination process is one of the most important phases of the electoral cycle this is when the community learns exactly who will stand to represent them on their local council
1638051 all candidates must ensure that their nominators are enrolled for the council area or ward in which they are standing and nominators should check their own enrolment status
1638052 we suggest that candidates are proposed by more than two nominators in case some nominators are not correctly enrolled
1638053 just the trophies cost us quite a few thousand dollars each year so any support is fantastic
1638054 i told one councillor it cost 50 000 a year and i said its like running a small business she replied its like running a big business were grateful for any support we get the little bits all add up
1638055 by clicking on www everydayhero com au vicki hamilton you can donate to heartfelt house and show the boys your support
1638056 donations over 2 are tax deductible and you get a receipt straight away you can also keep updated with our fundraising efforts and even leave a message of encouragement for the boys once you have donated
1638057 this is a water reuse scheme that is sustainable safe and environmentally sound and will provide benefits not only to council but the local community and most importantly the environment
1638058 clear recognition we could do better with water use and efficiency
1638059 so the ultimate aim with more users is to be able to reuse 1 1 megalitres per day in the dry months
1638060 this is an exciting step for council and we look forward to the opportunity of additional enterprises joining the scheme and further reducing the discharges to the sensitive water environment
1638061 it means a lot to actively achieve what we set out to do here this allows us to stop using groundwater which is a big thing
1638062 we used 80 000 litres of groundwater a day before this now thats 80 000 litres that we will stop using and thats helping people in town
1638063 without this type of operation council would struggle to meet their stated goal for the dry weather reuse of 80 per cent of treated water from the alstonville treatment plant by 2008 and 100 per cent reuse by 2013
1638064 labour has said over and over again that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing
1638065 it is difficult for health service estates to maintain a completely pest free environment but the level and variety of these infections is concerning
1638066 we need greater transparency in nhs infection control and publishing data like this is one way in which we can drive up overall hygiene standards
1638067 the use of pest control is seen as good proactive management
1638068 the health care commission have confirmed that health concerns around pest control have to date been negligible
1638069 the claim that insects spread hospital acquired infections is entirely unproven there is no evidence of their carriage of antibiotic resistant bacteria being a hazard to patients
1638070 despite this we expect hospitals to take continued action to tackle these pest problems
1638071 as far as we know this is the single largest identity theft case thats ever been charged in this country
1638072 the defendants in this country are charged with having stolen more than 40 million debit and credit card numbers
1638073 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and then install computer programs that gathered enormous amounts of financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1638074 they caused large widespread losses by banks retailers and customers
1638075 one of the greatest finds in recent african conservation history
1638076 we immediately felt well weve gotta be able to deliver on this and so theres a combination of great pride and joy followed by real urgency that we need to deliver for these animals
1638077 hey our brand is catching up with the market leader
1638078 its incredibly inspirational theres hundreds of nominees and each of them have a unique story to tell
1638079 in the past often doing something good as a young person meant you were called a sissy or bullied but with a program like this running were changing attitudes and more and more the kids that come along are being seen by their peers as role models that makes other kids want to get out there and do something worthwhile themselves so theres a real ripple effect
1638080 people come in and theres a real wow factor i think it makes people feel renewed hope for our community and our country because these kids will be running it in a few short years
1638081 seeing the compassion and sensibility these kids have gives you real confidence for the future of our communities
1638082 i felt compelled to do something rather than continue sitting around talking about it
1638083 i got involved in the local branch at young and eventually moved on to the state executive and ended up working as a staffer for former richmond mp larry anthony and mark vaile before i became a senator
1638084 people assume were all hayseeds and blokes but thats not true
1638085 the nationals represent farmers business people and a range of people who live and work outside cities
1638086 the expectation is that within a few weeks it will all be sorted out
1638087 fishability focuses on ability rather than disability to encourage independence and confidence
1638088 seeing the smiles on their faces when theyre catching fish serves as a constant reminder of why i do this i just love it
1638089 someone recently asked me if they could build their own coffin in the workshop the shed is always looking for projects and why not build a coffin we could screw them together in flat packs we could all build our own coffin and stick it in the garage
1638090 the project close to my heart is doing up my old dodge
1638091 what do we do we build things we wreck things and we talk about things we have cups of tea and sometimes cakes
1638092 best of all we welcome the fairer sex to come and join us this is truly a u3a project where those that teach will learn and those that learn may teach
1638093 we do anything from languages science discussion groups social activities forums embroiderers groups there is virtually something for everyone
1638094 the facts are that council has approved quite a bit of land for residential subdivision but the developers of that land have not progressed on it
1638095 they have been very slow and i guess that is also the market at play as it determines the extent of land releases but council has done what it can
1638096 we have subdivision approvals for the equivalent of at least 370 lots 230 at waterford park 110 at just st and 30 in joy st sitting on greenfield sites waiting for developers to build and put them on the market but because they have not done that council is powerless to do any more as it is privately owned land and we cant force them
1638097 council approved them in good faith but the owners have not proceeded only some small bits two das are being processed by council for land that is approved for residential purposes of around 120 lots dere st and theres another 250 lots trinity dr which have hit a hurdle so theres a total of 740 lots on the cusp ready to go on the market but in the hands of developers
1638098 but approvals have sunset clauses so when a developer does some meaningful work on the site even if it is relatively minor that approval goes on forever
1638099 the community and everyone is in the hands of private developers

1638141 i never get tired of her playing shes in her own little world
1638142 shes got a pool at home but this is more fun
1638143 we try to start as early as we can to beat the heat but the sun is starting to push us
1638144 well just stay hydrated and try to stay as cool as possible
1638145 on monday we got another load of documents on disk
1638146 its coming along but theres a lot of stuff to review
1638147 maybe theres people that want to take dance up as a hobby and dance is available in salem for all ages
1638148 what i realize is that life is all about the process not being at the olympic games but what it took to get to the olympic games
1638149 i got involved because i loved to flip upside down and i was always rearranging our living room furniture and flipping around
1638150 i put a little too much energy into it and flipped my feet over the chair but the chair happened to have rollers on it and the chair rolled and i went through the picture window into the front yard
1638151 i just remember my moms phone call to my dad weve got to get her into a gymnastics program before she ruins the rest of the house
1638152 i was very fortunate to be coached by him because i wouldnt say i was a real natural athlete and he was a real master at taking whatever walked in the door and working with it and helping you reach way beyond where your potential was
1638153 it was just something i loved to do and i think the fact that i got to compete in the olympics at such a young age kept me from feeling the pressure
1638154 it was just oh next week we go to the national championships the next week its the trials and then if you make it
1638155 and i was a gym where it was a very realistic goal to go to the olympic games i had teammates three of them who had been so we had been coached whenever we talked about goals it was when we get to munich when youre on the team it was never if
1638156 it was the eeriest feeling coming home and watching this on television and seeing that
1638157 it was so surreal because wed had this incredible international experience
1638158 its like eating dry toast if you do a floor routine with no music
1638159 sitting there were all these chinese americans who wanted this relationship with their former country
1638160 and i finish and the whole crowd stood and im looking and theyre crying and its all of a sudden clicking
1638161 it was absolutely the most wonderful ride that i have ever been on to get to be a part of it
1638162 this is one of the weaker months ive seen in the last five years
1638163 with the pressures that are on the consumer right now it seems as though theyre trying to take advantage of any help they can get
1638164 i will be more nervous walking into a full crowd because if you mess up you mess up live
1638165 i will be nervous because we have learnt so much in so little time
1638166 i will be more nervous walking into a full crowd because if you mess up you mess up live
1638167 but once you get going in front of a live crowd its the best
1638168 needless to say this is a tremendous honour and we are thrilled that sarah will once again be singing the theme song to the olympic games
1638169 many of you already know that she also sung the theme song for the 1992 barcelona olympic games with jose carreras to a global audience of 2 billion
1638170 showcase the ancient and long history of the chinese nation
1638171 i doubt we will get rooney fit for the start of the season
1638172 i doubt well get rooney fit for the start of the season with the virus hes had
1638173 its a virus he picked up in nigeria and its not a nice one but quite a few have had it
1638174 its such a bad virus and hes got to be training to be fit
1638175 he is in good spirits and was visiting family members
1638176 lasted approximately four and a half hours including recovery and he is in good spirits and was visiting family members
1638177 in my culture we never say i will win this or that
1638178 i am not jose mourinho so why compare me with him mourinho says i will win ten championships but i am more modest than that
1638179 i am from south brazil and in my culture we never say i will win this or that i just say that i will try my best to win all the competitions
1638180 but mourinho is mourinho he has a different culture to me
1638181 since i came to chelsea we have only spent 8 million on deco jose bosingwa came in before i arrived
1638182 maybe in the past they have spent more money but now they dont need to spend as much because they already have a solid base now they need a coach to develop young players and i think i am that coach
1638183 the new philosophy at chelsea is to bring some young boys through the system
1638184 i think we have a future as a public service broadcaster provided that we can get ofcom and the government to realise very very quickly that we cannot afford to pay more than the licence and the psb status is worth
1638185 ofcom estimates that to be around 45 million a year its presently costing us over 220 million a year if we cant get quick resolution to that then obviously as ofcom itself outlined in its recent consultation paper there is an option for itv to give up its public service status we dont want to do that
1638186 its not a threat its a realistic scenario which ofcom itself has proposed
1638187 a whole host of nanny state regulation about where we put advertising minutage how we have to treat our suppliers the contracts we enter into with independent producers are controlled by a regulator
1638188 this is all alice in wonderland this all belongs 20 years ago its so out of date
1638189 because of such considerations communities would love to know how to prepare people for psychologically stressful events and to increase the potential for recovery
1638190 researchers in the field of positive psychology in turn are busily working to find out what traits are shared by those people who demonstrate a greater capacity to cope in the hope of helping others to become more resilient to stress trauma and depression
1638191 efficient execution of all aspects of our development program resulted in a 75 increase in our comparable production volumes versus last year
1638192 we are increasing the value of this production through ongoing cost control which has reduced our unit production costs we believe the combination of these efforts puts quicksilver in the great position of being among the highest growth and lowest cost e amp p companies and that the announced acquisition of the additional fort worth basin properties will further enhance this position and ultimate value for our shareholders
1638193 that shows you that people are taking care of each other and that helps us out
1638194 its groups like these that make it possible for all of us to get this done and make our neighborhoods a comfortable place to live
1638195 its been nice because we are getting families and little children here
1638196 last year we had 18 of these in west salem
1638197 in the edgewater area they are having their local gatherings then combining events with a walk to walker middle school
1638198 the music the food and playing with my little brother
1638199 you dont feel as bad about waking them up at 2 in the morning to tell them their garage door is open
1638200 i have to give the glory to god because ive been struggling and ive been trying to stay mentally tough working through everything
1638201 if feels good to come out with five hits at the same time i do realize i didnt take five great swings
1638202 we got 21 hits and got a lot of breaks and i still felt like we were hanging on at the end
1638203 i think it was just important that we needed to get off to a good start and i was trying so hard for myself to make sure that happened
1638204 but im here and i know its going to be ok hes got hundreds of people praying for him and hes going to get through this
1638205 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1638206 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it this threat is real and we cannot shrink from our responsibility to combat it if we could create nato to face down the soviet union we can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks that have struck in madrid and amman in london and bali in washington and new york
1638207 america cannot do this alone the afghan people need our troops and your troops our support and your support to defeat the taliban and al qaida
1638208 the poverty and violence in somalia breeds the terror of tomorrow
1638209 europeans today are bearing new burdens and taking more responsibility in critical parts of the world
1638210 the walls between races and tribes natives and immigrants christian and muslim and jew cannot stand these now are the walls we must tear down
1638211 this is the moment when we must renew the goal of a world without nuclear weapons this is the moment to begin the work of seeking the peace of a world without nuclear weapons
1638212 i dont care if everyone else runs off the street and im the only one standing
1638213 that was my assessment of the fiscal situation if the fiscal situation changes then my assessment will change
1638214 but that was my assessment last week thats my assessment this week and i will stand on that principle well find out whos right

1638221 and so it goes he is a liberal but not fully liberal he has sometimes opposed the chicago political establishment but is also part of it he spoke at a rally against the iraq war while distancing himself from many antiwar activists

1638225 said greg nojeim senior counsel at the center for democracy and technology
1638226 says peter swire a professor of law at ohio state university in columbus
1638227 keep in mind that the data and internet service is provisioned over an existing fibre optic network system all the capex is laid in most of the capacity is laid in so when we sell a bit of bandwidth on that fibre optic system it delivers very high margins youre talking about gross margins that are in excess of 80 the encouraging thing is as mike pointed out there has been a very steady growth in the very high margin in the data internet business in fact now the revenue for that part of the business almost equals to the revenue in prepaid so it has become a very meaningful part of our business
1638228 im bleeding i think we need to go to the hospital
1638229 theres some fluid around the sac that isnt supposed to be there
1638230 she just means she cant see the shape because of the extra fluid

1638233 we couldnt even attribute it to divine providence since it was our own carelessness
1638234 the relationship was consensual and it ended earlier this year after a period of some months
1638235 i take responsibility for my being involved in this relationship and i regret the hurt caused to anyone including my family
1638236 i feel this statement is warranted to put the facts in context given the media interest
1638237 i have medical advice that i am suffering from depression and have been for some time
1638238 i hope that the media will respect the privacy of myself and my family as i make my recovery
1638239 i wish to thank all those people who have expressed their good wishes and offers of support

1638260 was wir bisher immer nur vermuten konnten wird jetzt durch zahlen untermauert
1638261 werbung in social networks l uft zurzeit noch nicht gut doch
1638262 um den dax ber 6600 punkte zu schieben m ssten schon noch neue impulse kommen
1638263 die fed hat die inflationsrisiken hinter den wachstumsrisiken zur ckgestellt
1638264 angesichts des konjunkturabschwungs in deutschland und der vorsicht des managements gibt es keinen grund commerzbank aktien zu haben
1638265 selbstverst ndlich w nschen auch wir uns prominente namen auf der referenten liste denn die bedeuten immer eine gewisse zugkraft doch wieder gilt bei der auswahl der referenten ist der teilnehmer nutzen ausschlaggebend
1638266 zu viele teilnehmer verlassen eine konferenz frustriert und in dem bewusstsein f r ihre investition in zeit und geld einen zu geringen nutzen erhalten zu haben
1638267 wer zum beispiel seinen am schreibtisch vorbereiteten vortrag abliest spricht einen schreibstil und l st beim zuh rer unweigerlich die frage aus lesen kann ich selbst warum bin ich hier
1638268 steigt ein referent zu tief in sein fachgebiet ein um sein wissen m glichst umfassend zu pr sentieren redet er sehr wahrscheinlich an seinen zuh rern vorbei
1638269 er hat etwas falsch gemacht und seinen zuh rer nicht erreicht der braucht nun das papier
1638270 egal wie gut ihr inhalt ist wie interessant sie ihn referieren wenn die aufnahmekapazit t ihrer zuh rer berschritten ist ist alles was sie noch bieten k nnen blo er schall
1638271 einer gruppe von besuchern wurden drei verschiedene b ume gezeigt einen ganzen tag lang einer anderen gruppe 27 b ume nach drei wochen wurde getestet an wie viele b ume sich die teilnehmer erinnern konnten die erste gruppe kannte noch alle drei b ume die zweite nicht einen einzigen
1638272 und doch tun es die wenigsten dabei ist es absurd zu meinen nur weil man sich in einem bestimmten fachgebiet auskennt dieses auch gut vermitteln zu k nnen
1638273 routiniers m ssen vielleicht nur einen neuen teil probeweise referieren aber das sind dann ganz sicher f nf minuten die sich lohnen
1638274 dann stellt sich heraus dass der vortrag im kopf ganz anders abl uft als in der realit t nun zeigen sich l ngen unklarheiten und h nger
1638275 m nner die zu laut sprechen sind kerle frauen die zu laut sprechen keifen
1638276 die sprechweise f hrt zu k rperlichen reaktionen bei den zuh rern

1638285 eine botschaft pro folie nicht mehr und alles was leseenergie abzieht ist schlecht also keine berschrift kein logo
1638286 diese aussage wird kaum zu begeisterungsst rmen f hren denn die zahl allein sagt nichts aus doch wenn sie zun chst erkl ren dass sie bereits der zweite berater waren und die produktionszeit zuvor schon von 10 auf 8 minuten runter gefahren wurde gut diese schwierigkeit macht schon mal neugierig wenn sie dann erl utern dass eine gr ndliche berpr fung der umst nde sie davon berzeugt hat dass eine weitere verk rzung auf 7 minuten m glich sein sollte dann wird es schon fast spannend wenn sie jetzt aber geradezu minuti s schildern wie sie nach der von ihnen vorgenommenen umorganisation die produktion haben anlaufen lassen wie die messung begann wie jedes ergebnis f r sich festgehalten addiert nochmals berpr fte wurde staunende blicke ausgetauscht wurden und schlie lich verk nden vier kom ma drei dann haben sie ihr publikum gefesselt

1638292 western australia has got the best anti smoking record of any state in australia and we intend to maintain that
1638293 there is nothing more annoying than having to endure cigarette smoke wafting under your nose when youre trying to enjoy a meal
1638294 i think given that smokers are in the greater minority group these days that really people should be able to enjoy the social pleasure of an alfresco area
1638295 its a very strong smoke signal to the wa government to bring in some blanket bans across the whole of wa
1638296 if for no other reason than many people arent aware of where local government boundaries are and state legislation would be much easier to police than legislation thats brought in by local councils
1638297 many tourists coming from overseas are coming from jurisdictions where there dont even exist bans on indoor smoking let alone some sort of illogical nonsensical outdoor smoking ban

1638301 war is essentially an evil thing its consequences are not confined to the belligerent states alone but affect the whole world to initiate a war of aggression therefore is not only an international crime it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole
1638302 the united nations charter has a provision which was formulated by and agreed to by the united states after world war ii it says that from now on no nation can use armed force without the permission of the u n security council they can use force in connection with self defence but a country cant use force in anticipation of self defence

1638318 i took some scouts on a hike across england we started from the irish sea and went all the way across the country 192 miles
1638319 i was helping edit some of the scouts college applications and they wrote about the hike and called it one of the greatest experiences of their childhood and how it was an experience they will remember for the rest of their lives
1638320 when i looked into the chisholm trail i found out it runs right by the farm
1638321 i didnt know what to do i was trying to pull him out and he began bucking
1638322 i didnt know how to ride but i took some lessons before i came

1638327 im not a prostitute so i dont know why youre calling me
1638328 im glad that he stepped up to this but lets be clear he doesnt have any support in his own party yet for this and unless he can get republicans to agree with his point of view we could be here for an extended period of time
1638329 this has been very stressful for me as you can imagine because these allegations have been around now for many many years and i want my case finalised
1638330 that amounted to a disclosure of serious illegal insider trading activity
1638331 it was the blackest night there was no moon it was just mist and darkness
1638332 before i could end the call she said to me well i think you have got to know that theres a plan by some people on the jury to go out to check out the crime scene at night
1638333 its pretty clear they the defence doesnt want us to see it the alleged crime scene at night
1638334 theres a woman on the jury whos quite a bully and shes telling us all to do it this woman has already decided that hes guilty and that we should go out to the gap to see why
1638335 i heard some of them mentioning that in the jury room
1638336 they kind of joked about that visiting watsons bay but not seriously
1638337 he was called out in an emergency he had to unlock the courthouse at darlinghurst and gain access to the safe in order to telephone each juror he knew that the conversations he was going to have with those jurors were important and more than casual he is likely in those circumstances i think to have an accurate recollection of anything significant said to him by a juror
1638338 it makes no sense to me that the juror should have thought that her fellow jurors were having a joke but not about a private visit if it were not a private visit they were talking about where would the joke lie
1638339 i conclude from this evidence that there was talk in the jury room about a private visit to watsons bay i do not believe that such discussions were had only as a joke
1638340 this has the unfortunate result that i am unable publicly to vindicate those jurors who have throughout acted properly they know who they are the court thanks them for their service

1638350 this lawsuit against santa clara demonstrates the cras ongoing commitment to establishing a flexible and reasonable statewide standard for nutritional information disclosure

1638360 i think it is reasonable to get fire station 37 done and i am encouraging councilman oliverio to just be reasonable and logical about this
1638361 i think that he had some problems with the terms of allowing animal control unlimited access to his property without warrants and allowing them to trap his dogs
1638362 when people become so blinded by ideology they commit crimes that trample the rights of their neighbors and put lives in danger the fbi must act
1638363 we hope this reward serves as an incentive to take the often difficult step of bringing important information to the attention of law enforcement
1638364 the whole idea of domestic terrorism is definitely a high priority especially in a case like this where lives were placed in danger
1638365 we hope to glean enough from the video to determine how many people are involved and their basic descriptions to corroborate some leads we have gotten up to today

1638415 they are being exposed to sex and to talk about sex before theyre even old enough to even think about having sex
1638416 young people who watch a lot of sexual content on television have distorted attitudes about sexuality that it must be that everybodys whos not married is going around having sex all the time and having kinky sex in all kinds of strange situations
1638417 the rise of sexually transmitted diseases and the increase in out of wedlock pregnancies and births
1638418 im not sure i accept the premise that negative effects arent happening
1638419 it has been going down and the rate s of out of wedlock births and of teen births have been going down but until they go down to zero we have to keep trying to promote these positive values in our culture
1638420 the truth is children think about sex whether we want them to or not there are groups of people out there who are devoted to scaring the heck out of americans i think it makes some people feel good because they say aha theres the enemy and if only we could do something about that everything would be better

1638460 we knew there were apes there we just had no idea how many
1638461 shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working
1638462 if these new gorilla census figures are confirmed by further surveys it would be the most exciting ape conservation news in years
1638463 nest census data are notorious for varying from one method to the next however and i think we should be cautious before assuming the worlds known gorilla population has just doubled
1638464 technical problems with the conversion of ape nest density to estimates of gorilla density preclude a rigorous estimate of range wide gorilla abundance
1638465 it is not that i think that the numbers are necessarily too high
1638466 it is just that i do not trust the assumptions made by the estimation models that are being used
1638467 what does seem clear is that there are still plenty of western gorillas in northern congo

1638485 but i felt i owed it to him when i see how despicable he is now i cant help but feel mighty proud
1638486 it is true he has nothing redeeming about him at all
1638487 think of the grinch before he heard all the whos singing on christmas day hanks worse than that no heart and at least the grinch gave back the presents he stole from the kids
1638488 i called the guy the godfather of closers for crying out loud what more do they want
1638489 i said to the media he should close what the hell do these people not understand how stupid can they get
1638490 look dude im about as stupid as you can get
1638491 theres not a lot of thinking going on in this big ol head of mine which is why they want me out there in the ninth inning to close a win but these fans i never thought id say this but theyre a hell of a lot stupider than ill ever be and thats saying something lemme tell ya
1638492 it gives me that little extra bounce i love i will also be the first to go on record as saying that the legend is true a little dab really will do ya
1638493 hes must be the only human being and i use that term loosely on earth still using that stuff
1638494 we dont need this all weekend those fans are going to be wearing madonna masks and ripping out every madonna and kabballah bit there is its gonna be merciless can we please get rid of this clown and just play baseball
1638495 oh is it going to be a tough weekend for him
1638496 we want to make sure hes completely healthy before he comes back
1638497 well miss him but i think he should take a long long long time and make sure hes 100
1638498 my research indicates that this injury could keep him out of action for the rest of this season and the next two years
1638499 now coincidentally that would be when his contract ends but when do the red sox ever think about money we want whats best for the player we want him off the field way off the field uh until hes completely healthy
1638500 they want big papi back as soon as possible and yet with me they say im so valuable that they want me to take a long time a really long time to heal
1638501 wow dude thats true love right there i knew i was good but more valuable than papi i told francona im so touched ill be back in august
1638502 i think we were all spooked and in a state of shock from when they wheeled george out onto the field at first i thought it was something from the wax museum once we got the chills out we played fine

1638510 they took me through underground passages and made me sit in another waiting room for almost 45 minutes a man approached me and called me to another room for interrogation he asked me to sit down and presented himself as moshe
1638511 after all my responses he said to me i want to talk to you openly when you return from israel so that you will have an acceptable reputation on the israeli side

1638514 the states obligations are derived among other things from the rules of war and from the scope of its control over border crossings between it and the gaza strip

1638516 other companies may indeed be struggling but our confidence and ambitions are buttressed by very healthy balance sheets
1638517 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1638518 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1638519 they seem more concerned about growth for the rest of this year and id say right now they appear to be dovish for the short term
1638520 even if oil prices stay here thats likely a significant stimulus to the economy particularly to consumers
1638521 labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress
1638522 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1638523 to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1638524 this is not an economy hungering for lower interest rates
1638525 the fed doesnt need to lower interest rates the fed needs to act to restore confidence and liquidity in all the credit markets
1638526 weve seen this continued deterioration of price in response to lower demand
1638527 and in four weeks its labor day and the peak summer travel season is over
1638528 plus theres been ample supply for our needs and we continue to receive imports
1638529 his argument is based on the number of stuns fears and assorted other of immobilization effects that abound in the current state of the game there was some agreement with the original poster that spell pushback is unnecessary as casters often quickly fall prey to melee dps theres only so much a trinket can do
1638530 all talents and skills granting pushback resistance would have to be changed to something else so that would only exacerbate the problem
1638531 if you cant kite a rogue as a druid you need to reevaluate your methods
1638532 my normal and happy life has now been filled with so much turmoil and ive endured so much physical pain and mental anguish from this crime committed against me
1638533 in most of the markets there can be only handful of telecom players who can survive profitably
1638534 consolidation acts as a tool for companies to come together and rationalise their operations thereby increasing their chance of survival as well as develop better competencies to compete profitably in the market place
1638535 as the penetration levels increase and growth plateaus it will be very difficult to sustain by relying only on traditional expansion so players in the region will have to look beyond their traditional geographies and undertake cross border consolidation to ensure they survive
1638536 considering that there are more smaller operators in the growing sub african region incumbents and large operators will target smaller operators for m amp a across more mature me markets we expect big operators to come together for a possible merger or an acquisition with many large operators present across many countries cross border m amp a might also be in demand
1638537 though the me sub region has seen a high level of m amp a activity over the last two years the growth in some of the key countries is slowing down and the current growth opportunities seem to be limited whereas the african sub region driven by the high growth opportunities is expected to witness higher m amp a activity over the next 12 18 months
1638538 the middle east and africa region is one the fastest growing as well as the least penetrated regions in the world the bulk of the growth has come from african sub region rather than the middle east sub region the demand for telecom services continues to be very high and the growth in the revenues has been very attractive leading to a situation that almost every major player in the world is either already present or have definite plans to expand into the region
1638539 at the moment we have got a good number of south east asian operators on our books who are looking for acquisition opportunities in this part of the world
1638540 they have been very successful in fact they were the pioneers of international expansion for this part of the world and they have been taking a very prudent and cautious approach so they have kicked the tyres on almost every acquisition opportunity that has arisen but they havent yet really struck out
1638541 increasingly they are looking toward africa where they can get in to some pretty raw markets where the demographics for growth are pretty sound africa has got 25 mobile and fixed line penetration continent wide and most of that is stacked up in north africa and south africa there are some pretty prime markets throughout africa but their attention is going towards those markets
1638542 they will have to grow or they will be acquired
1638543 i think we will continue to see them expand etisalat will pick up opportunities in africa as and when they arise

1638546 this man has the worst work ethic imaginable cloud arrives late leaves early have long breakfasts at classen grill and jogs with his dog in the early afternoon he consistently embarrasses his assistants with his ability to disappear when work beckons and hes not real quick on the uptake even on the rare occasions when he actually is in the office the fact is cloud wants denise bode pay for ghost commissioner work and nobody wants to pay for that
1638547 to lower trade barriers decrease trade distorting subsidies and stabilize an affordable food supply for all nations
1638548 reasonable reforms to our crop insurance program and our system of countercyclical and direct aid payments
1638549 todays announcement marks the next step in our strategy to develop a significant platinum business and add further scale and diversification to our portfolio
1638550 we will if the gold price is weak take the opportunity to take the balance out but at the moment we think that move would be quite difficult in terms of the market
1638551 well see a 17 percent discount to spot in the next two quarters and as we come into 2009 that discount will be reduced to 6 percent
1638552 we will by the end of the year take out about 5 million ounces roughly matching this years total production
1638553 the sale of the venezuelan interest occurred quite quickly as the result of not being able to operate for almost 130 days out of the past year
1638554 while our almost 10 years in venezuela were good for hecla leaving now allows us to focus on greens creek in alaska the lucky friday in idaho and the next generation of operations
1638555 lesters an excellent football coach so we had versatility with him
1638556 when we came to fill carls spot my preference my objective was leaning toward an offensive coach but i just had to go out and find the best guy not the best running backs coach that made the thing a little bit easier
1638557 it ended up being one of those lucky breaks for us that he was available
1638558 this is my first job coaching running backs but ive coached just about every other position on offense
1638559 its exciting its a new opportunity youre learning new things im replacing carl jackson on this staff but ill never replace him its obviously hard replacing a legend a great coach like that but i think its new and exciting
1638560 when i had the linebackers i was so involved with the linebackers that maybe i didnt get to know everybody else as much as youd like to know them as kids
1638561 one of my goals with norm as it is with any coach is to keep them working effectively for as long as we possibly can
1638562 one thing i wanted to do was try to cut back on some of norms duties like summer camps we really dont need norms energy there part of my thinking is to create an nfl coordinator position for him i think it gives us a couple benefits itll give him a little more preparation time during the day because he wont be sitting in on individual group meetings with players i think thatll be a benefit the other benefit is i think it gives him a little bit more freedom to visit individually with players from all positions free him up more time to do that i think we get a benefit there to fill that void
1638563 i wanted to free some of erics time up to be our personnel director give him more time to study prospects tapes and all that
1638564 the way we recruit we probably have to look a little harder and look a little deeper and maybe watch more tape than some other places
1638565 let me begin by citing a few of your statements with which i am in accord and with which most liberals and progressives also agree
1638566 would be wrong for conservatives to adopt a knee jerk negative response to tax proposals or spending initiatives
1638567 for at least six years as ive become increasingly frustrated by the bush administrations repeated betrayal of constitutional and conservative principles i have defended vice president cheney a man ive known for decades and with whom i served and made common cause in congress
1638568 for a high profile religious conservative like reed the stories of being paid millions by one indian tribe to run a religious based antigambling campaign to prevent another tribe from opening a rival casino made him look like something worse than a criminal a hypocrite
1638569 we continue to execute against our permitting timeline and have filed applications for the key nevada state permits
1638570 our plans call for environmental protections that are intended to be at the leading edge of mining industry environmental efforts our goal is to build a facility that will stand out as a model in the industry

1638582 meewees objective is to increase childrens love of learning by harnessing the power of hip hop music in an educational context
1638583 children love to create and meewee encourages them to express themselves
1638584 i find meewee music to be incredibly energetic for our young children and i now consider it an integral part of our curriculum
1638585 we use the songs in our first grade class and the childrens creativity is sparked they become songwriters and write lyrics to the meewee beats
1638586 we are very excited about our ability to provide teachers with uplifting positive music that helps boost kids self esteem and motivation to learn
1638587 i wish i had meewee music in school when i was growing up the beats and rhymes are so catchy and entertaining you cant stop dancing and singing along
1638588 my kids love meewee it opens up their channels for creative thought
1638589 das olympische fu ballturnier ist nicht im koordinierten spiele kalender inkludiert und damit gilt keine entscheidung des fifa exekutivkomitees ber eine obligatorische abstellung der spieler unter 23 jahren f r dieses turnier die bedingungen f r eine solche entscheidung sind nicht gegeben
1638590 i think we have a future as a public service broadcaster provided that we can get ofcom and the government to realise very very quickly that we cannot afford to pay more than the licence and the psb status is worth
1638591 ofcom estimates that to be around 45 million a year its presently costing us over 220 million a year
1638592 if we cant get quick resolution to that then obviously as ofcom itself outlined in its recent consultation paper there is an option for itv to give up its public service status
1638593 its not a threat its a realistic scenario which ofcom itself has proposed

1638611 there will be more investments in telecom sector of bahrain as well as in other countries in the region
1638612 motorola brings a wealth of experience which will help to enhance the level of services

1638616 was not satisfied that all charges were fair and reasonable
1638617 the rio is the basic offer by batelco to other licensed operators olos that allows them to provide telecommunications services to their customers as well as connect to batelcos network so that their customers can communicate with batelcos customers
1638618 the rio outlines the wholesale rates the olos pay to batelco for terminating the services where the retail rate that the consumer pays is made up of the olos retail costs plus the wholesale charge
1638619 having reviewed the rio and having healthy debates with batelcos team tra was not satisfied that all charges were fair and reasonable
1638620 in a liberalised market where licensed operators are entitled to build their own networks it is important to get all operators customers connected therefore the availability of interconnection services is a key issue for operators in order to be able to function competitively
1638621 we hope that this reduction will be reflected on the retail charges that consumers pay and give financial incentives to all market players to invest more in telecommunications infrastructure this will support economic development and consumers will enjoy the benefits of competition and greater choice

1638649 these guys must be working for next to nothing these days
1638650 weve had a number of drivers come by our offices saying that low rates were a concern this is going to help a lot of them who are having trouble making ends meet
1638651 if we work 12 hours we can barely eat we work a minimum 70 to 80 hours a week just to pay the bills and the rent this changes nothing

1638655 we are going to deliver free internet access to everyone in bahrain to anybody that wants it we will obviously start area by area and we will take it form there and cover the whole country
1638656 obviously i am not going to give unlimited internet access free of charge what i am going to do is offer batelcos bd10 package free of charge a bd120 a year saving for a family that cant afford it is a lot of money
1638657 it is not going to be one of those annoying multi pop up advertisements none of that is going to be there
1638658 the quicker people sign up the quicker we will expand the network
1638659 this is a gift to bahrain we will offer attractive internet connectivity to other parts of the region but at the end of the day we are not a charity we are a business we want to make money so we cant really give it free to everybody
1638660 i would like to see all my competitors do the same and give free internet to the users
1638661 at the end of the day competition should make money from other avenues of business from the persons phone line from other value added services that they use such as iptv and the like there are so many channels out there that are still not even broadcast here
1638662 it just really solidifies this biotech cluster were trying to create

1638667 sie haben doch so viel kirchenkritisches gemacht k nnten sie nicht doch wieder einmal ein buch f r uns machen
1638668 es gibt in der allgemeinen wahrnehmung ein theologisches randthema das f r mich allerdings zentral ist und habe mich dann hin gesetzt und das von einigen leuten pamphlet genannte buch geschrieben
1638669 wir sind hier ganz durcheinander haben sie das buch gelesen
1638670 es gibt nur ein derartiges buch die kirche und unser geld
1638671 also das hefte ich mir an diese kirchenaustritte wie einen orden

1638686 would place a chill upon political speakers of all varieties and undermine the robust nature of political debate in oklahoma
1638687 puts the government in the position of determining what constitutes truth in an arena where what is truth is itself often the focus of fierce debate
1638688 allows the state to determine the truth of any communication that relates to the character voting record or acts of the candidate
1638689 statements about the character of a candidate are more opinion than fact they are characterizations a governmental system that determines the truth of a characterization under penalty of law is a standard so vague and overbroad that to enforce it would chill speech of every variety
1638690 the notion that the government rather than the people may be the final arbiter of truth in political debate is fundamentally at odds with the first amendment
1638691 as the supreme court of washington aptly put it a provision like the oklahoma proposal naively assumes that the government is capable of correctly and consistently negotiating the thin line between fact and opinion in political speech
1638692 compounding the problem with nationalizing an election is the fact that independent voters have not gotten the message theyre supposed to dislike obamas standing with independents is almost as strong with democrats
1638693 mccain and republicans continue to enjoy a significant advantage with voters on trust and to handle terrorism
1638694 restrict supply to genuine cases of treatment of short term pain
1638695 the adverse side effects and problems happen over a long period of time not usually in short treatment bursts so limiting pack sizes would be the way to go

1638705 would it be all right if we just sat and i like those sunday marathons of either mythbusters or dirty jobs
1638706 ive been lucky over my career with my recuperative powers but it was one thing we wanted to make sure with the knee that it was more about longevity than anything
1638707 we didnt want to put any extra strain or pressure on it
1638708 for me it was making sure my leg was right you dont want to be going out with that hanging over your head that your bodys not right
1638709 in 2006 it wasnt much fun spending a week in hospital with golden staph
1638710 there has always been the concern about the knee but ive been able to manage it really well through the footy club the doctors physios and fitness staff so ive been lucky
1638711 at some points it causes you a fair bit of grief but youre able to push through
1638712 there was a part there where i struggled a fair bit and you go through periods where you wonder whether or not its worth putting your body through that much pain but at the end of the day weve been able to manage it well
1638713 i thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when
1638714 i dont really know what kind of girl i am
1638715 as if id marry you youd be the meanest wife ever
1638716 would it be all right if we just sat and one of the things i loved about the movie is that its fundamentally a story of four individuals juno bleeker vanessa and mark and how their personalities and quirks drive what happens
1638717 i can take care of this myself and i dont need anyone elses help
1638718 what should i finally saw this last night and really liked it
1638719 would it be all right if we just sat and

1638724 bahrains score of over 200 per cent indicates a well connected population with a high percentage of citizens enjoying access to more than one mode of communication
1638725 businesses locating in bahrain recognise the excellent ict information communications technology infrastructure as one of the many advantages that moving to the kingdom can bring
1638726 there were allegations by a member of parliament the minister of finance instructed me to meet with the mp and today we are listening to batelcos board to hear both sides
1638727 from there we determine if there is a need for any issues to be investigated
1638728 each and every allegation will be investigated by batelcos board
1638729 it is unfortunate that a number of unsubstantiated allegations have been made under parliamentary privilege aimed to discredit one of the most successful companies in bahrain
1638730 can anyone believe someone who earns 5 347 dinars a month should get 11 34 million dinars just to keep him for six months
1638731 a bogus scheme of 1 5 million dinars to improve the structure of batelcos services has never been checked by the companys projects committee not assessed by the purchase department not presented to the board which approved it although the name of the supplier was fake
1638732 as a religion we have come to believe that there are many expressions of spirituality that will give us the depth and breadth of religious experience to enable us to live out our values in the world and help create a better world for all
1638733 we figured it was the least we could do after that foul up
1638734 we couldnt completely control the coaches votes but they have so little time to study other games during the season that they base it off the ap anyway and it worked out just right

1638746 we urge all residents to be vigilant and keep an eye out for any suspicious activity in your community
1638747 wokingham borough council has been a very strong advocate of a third thames bridge for many many many years
1638748 there were plans for a third thames bridge in the 1800s
1638749 the infrastructure shows this the a3290 goes right into sutton seeds business park
1638750 the reason it does this is because there was going to be a bridge built there
1638751 after reading the independent transport commission report we have bitten the bullet and put in a bid to seera
1638752 we are the lead bidders and we have a secondary bidder which is reading borough council it is one of the major capital bids of the future we are trying to drive plans for a bridge forward
1638753 oxfordshire county council is against a bridge and we have a big hill to climb because of that
1638754 we are hoping there is a groundswell of pressure on them
1638755 they have legitimate concerns but we should be able to address the issue that a bridge is for the benefit of all
1638756 the cash bid is totally apolitical and involves us reading borough council and mps martin salter rob wilson and theresa may
1638757 it is one of those situations i write all my articles by hand and my secretary then types them up
1638758 she did not read my handwriting and i was not available to check the proofs for the article it was my fault i should have proofed the pages fat hen is an edible weed but henbane is not
1638759 i urge people not to touch it unless they want to go to another land he joked
1638760 apparently in olden days henbane used to be used as a witchs potion
1638761 antony is very sorry for causing confusion and had quite a different plant in mind
1638762 i had a minor panic at the start by resetting my bike computer wrongly but with 15 seconds to go i managed to get trip time and heart rate on display which was what i needed
1638763 i had another slight worry when the transmission started to make a grating but the noise disappeared as mysteriously as it had appeared
1638764 soon after my start there was a half hour of persistent rain
1638765 the wind wasnt helping matters either being a cross wind that hindered riding in either direction
1638766 however riding my first 100 i figured i just had to be stoic and get on with it and thats what i did
1638767 being a multi lap course with the start and finish close together it was easy to calculate how you were doing
1638768 i had a good marker in readings peter graham after one lap i could see that he had gained about 20 seconds on me
1638769 second lap and again peter had put another 20 seconds into me
1638770 this consistency was reassuring as were the split times which were holding steady
1638771 my ride was now simply a case of getting to the end fatigue was always creeping up on me but on laps three and four peter was still only gaining 20 seconds each time so all was well
1638772 on the final lap i did try to summon up some more speed but it didnt last
1638773 the slip roads were mountains and if anything the extra effort had damaged my final split time
1638774 racing for the line simply didnt happen as i just couldnt get my heart rate up to turn the pedals either faster or harder
1638775 i finished on 4 hours 12 minutes 10 seconds and was happy with that i waited at the finish line but peter never showed up in fact he had cramped so badly at 90 miles that he couldnt continue
1638776 damp conditions at the start and heavy conditions out to the turn stole the advantage i was hoping to gain from this fast course
1638777 i enjoyed the return leg and despite misjudging the position of the finishing line was pleased to go under the hour in my second 25 of the season
1638778 im concerned about all the children and the public who enter the temple every tuesday and sunday hes been coughing and coughing for the past three or four months
1638779 we use the same microphones and he also gives food out to the people during the service and were all using the same dishes
1638780 the damage has been done now he was fine when he came from india a year and a half ago if they do hire a priest from india why dont they do a health check before they employ him
1638781 were a bit concerned about our children going to the temple and also we dont know whether we have to go for any tests
1638782 they both reassured the congregation and answered questions raised by the members of the congregation
1638783 the message given by them was communicated to the congregation in hindi and information leaflets were left at the temple for the congregation to read and take away
1638784 the matter is closed now he is a manchester united player its finished hell be playing here next season believe me its finished
1638785 van der vaart is the first and possibly the only signing of the summer for real madrid
1638786 it will be a tough game forest have just come up so they are used to winning
1638787 i played a bit in this league last season and some of the results were incredible
1638788 we want to put last season behind us its not good going out of the premiership by relegation
1638789 we all wanted to keep the club there but we didnt do that so now we have to forget about it
1638790 i think its easier to stay in the premier league than it is to get out of this league it will be tough but well look forward to it
1638791 pre season has been good we have prepared well and worked hard
1638792 you will have to ask the manager that he has four strikers and well see what happens
1638793 as a footballer and a young lad you want to play as many games as you can
1638794 she miss clafton tried to get in between them and at that point was punched around the head several times which hit a glass window she was standing against
1638795 she had bruises to both sides of her head a slight black eye and a sore nose and upper lip
1638796 the brother was on the phone attempting to use it but it wasnt working and he dropped it she miss clafton bent down to pick it up and that led to the first part of the assault
1638797 payne then ran up and appeared to kick the phone and as she reached he kicked her wrist however she had previously had an accident on the wrist and was wearing a support
1638798 it had been getting a lot better but started to hurt again she was angry and as a result threw the phone back at the defendant who then got hold of her brother
1638799 i just want to say that night was a just a poor reaction to her throwing the phone at me unfortunately i hit her it was the only mistake i made that night
1638800 i was drunk and what i did was get involved in something i would not have done with a clear head
1638801 its not in my nature to hurt anybody i am a decent bloke i do not like violence
1638802 we were aware that bobby was not the first person locally to die while riding a motorcycle recently however the numbers being quoted by police are simply horrific
1638803 it has become quite clear by reading the post and looking at the police website this is a real issue locally that most dont bother to pay too much attention to until it happens to you or someone you love
1638804 bobby loved motorcycling he was a very experienced good steady and careful rider of his machines but reading some of the articles its very clear far too many road users do not pay enough attention when on the roads
1638805 we simply cannot stand by and watch this tragic waste of life
1638806 motorcyclists need to understand the risks they run when they get on the bike and everyone should be aware of the consequences when a bike is involved in an accident because for many bikers their first crash is their last crash
1638807 we have been successful in reducing the overall number of people killed or seriously injured in road collisions but the number of motorcycle related casualties remains unacceptably high
1638808 one key is to adapt the tools to the problems and not vice versa
1638809 the police conducted a search of the moped and found herbal cannabis and a grinder
1638810 he is a bit of a mixed bag of a young man
1638811 the wtcmi is supposed to be a non political partnership between the shops traders in the town wokingham borough council and of course woodley town council
1638812 in the position of town centre manager you are accountable to each of these groups with the main task being to help keep woodley shopping centre as successful and enjoyable place to shop as possible
1638813 unfortunately for me i do not have a political bone in my body and have found it a struggle to comprehend some of the political goings on that have come up recently
1638814 the job is not the easiest at the best of times without having problems issues put on you from members of your steering group whose political parties views differ to the purpose of wtcmi
1638815 for the benefit of the town centre the wtcmi has to be totally and 100 per cent apolitical and that is why i am personally sad and annoyed liz is going
1638816 she was the best thing that had happened to woodley town centre in the last 10 years her leaving will set the town back five years
1638817 i think liz was drawn into the politics and that was not something that had happened to her before and perhaps she did not realise how tough it can be
1638818 i do not see how when one council goes against another it can be apolitical you cannot divorce it completely
1638819 both grounds have their pluses but obviously lords has a bit more to offer so it would be better to get the game over and done with today
1638820 by this continued delay and dithering about making a decision on the national broadband plan were sacrificing 200 to 350 million a month
1638821 we ought to be out there digging holes laying cable connecting people
1638822 there has been no change in the afps position on its submission
1638823 our findings will go to the federal government and you know weve got to have all that put together by the end of september and make any recommendations that we can at the same time
1638824 lots of the issues will come back to state governments and local governments as well as to what they can do within their communities
1638825 there is not enough water in the system to bring down the sorts of quantities of water youd need to fill the lower lakes and to handle the evaporation in the lakes and transmission loss
1638826 even if we did make a decision to not give any allocations upstream there is insufficient water currently in storage less the critical human needs issue for us to viably manage the lower lakes with the amount of water that we have
1638827 penny wong has waved the white flag on the future of the lower lakes
1638828 destroying the freshwater ecology of the lower lakes for a generation a half century or perhaps even a century
1638829 if that action is taken it is a very sad day for how australia has mismanaged the murray darling basin
1638830 its a profoundly important decision because the advice i have is once the salt waters in there it is next to impossible to get it out

1638836 we have reviewed 500 of those to date we have not found a similar problem in those cases
1638837 its obviously an embarrassment and we would rather not be in this position
1638838 only this morning we concluded testing and have got to the stage where we are satisfied we cant rely on dna evidence in this case
1638839 we have very sophisticated systems in place to guard against cross contamination in the laboratory the evidence is they work 99 99 per cent of the time here the 01 per cent has slipped through and been picked up
1638840 we have refined the process to ensure the 01 is picked up before the information is released and passed to the public
1638841 this is human error we have systems because humans arent fool proof and occasionally make mistakes but the system picked that up and the public can and should have confidence in the integrity of the dna testing processes in place

1638843 las temperaturas son tan altas que gran parte del equipo de perforaci n se fundir a y quedar a unido sin funcionar m s
1638844 la alta temperatura de las fumarolas es especialmente interesante dado que esta dorsal oce nica no se expande muy r pidamente
1638845 por lo que se puede presumir que esta porci n sur de la dorsal atl ntica est en una fase muy magm tica y ha estado as durante unos a os
1638846 la explicaci n podr a ser que hay una gran cantidad de magma pero tras unos pocos a os m s de altas temperaturas se alcanza el punto en el que es avergonzante la cantidad de magma necesaria para mantenerlos durante ese tiempo
1638847 si esto resulta ser as entonces tendremos que apuntar algunos detalles muy importantes

1638874 i was raised by a single mother who was also a part time lawyer it did me no harm whatsoever and i fully intend to be one myself one day
1638875 sorry about your balls guys but these babies are ours and they will remain ours whilst they are born from our bodies we would be only too delighted for you to help us genuinely help us with the work of raising the next generation but fatherhood is a privilege not a right
1638876 now i know youre not asking for financial support and therefore feel able to dispense with the representation but i think if you divorce men from an equal responsibility and stake in rearing children you should not be surprised if they either choose not to play or bugger off and leave you holding the baby
1638877 it would merely confirm the woman as the initial and default rights holder
1638878 why shouldnt feminist writing be provocative why shouldnt it be belligerent ask pointed questions try to get a rise out of people why shouldnt the language commentators on this blog use to talk about the tories be similar to the language feminists on this blog use to talk about the patriarchy
1638879 im still doing my own research into the topic and hoping to come back with concrete data to back up these opinion pieces pretty damn soon
1638880 why annexe procreation because i want to challenge a host of conservative notions that hold that fathers are an absolute necessity that lack of fathers is whats wrong with this society
1638881 i think we need to stop taking it on faith that a child is better off with a father
1638882 the first couple of weeks were fine but since then the problems began and they have been getting worse
1638883 there is no cctv in the block that is the problem
1638884 people are drinking in the corridors leaving bottles all over the place they are marking the walls and urinating in the lifts they just have no respect for the building at all
1638885 there are people living in this brand new really nice block of apartments who do not deserve to live here
1638886 it is frustrating this is going on and as yet nothing has been done about it i know they have been looking into getting cctv but if they dont act imminently the damage will already be done
1638887 the building can only be accessed by people with keys so this behaviour is being carried out either by residents or their visitors
1638888 catalyst residents have a fundamental right to live in a peaceful pleasant environment
1638889 that is why we take anti social behaviour extremely seriously
1638890 we agree with residents this vandalism is utterly unacceptable and we are working to put a stop to it and take action against the perpetrators where we can
1638891 we will be consulting with residents and the police about how we can best tackle the problem which may include an option of installing cctv in the building
1638892 on a friends note i hope everyone fulfils their personal ambitions but on a selfish note i want all the best players to stay and help push us to the premier league

1638916 nuance is first introducing the powerful nuance mobile care framework for mobile service providers worldwide

1638949 ill tip my hat to them they familiarized the american people with churros and gave people that first wonderful experience
1638950 theyre sold in the mornings by women who carry large flat baskets on their heads

1638959 he had so much fun riding the rides with us
1638960 i remember laughing as we rode the log ride and screaming as we rode the big dipper for my first roller coaster experience
1638961 unfortunately he died a year later but i will always remember him acting like a big kid that day with us
1638962 oh what fun riding chartered buses from the town square to geauga lake
1638963 the kids would always be on the lookout to see who would be first to see the big dipper ahead
1638964 we told our mothers after the fact and it was then that my mother realized i was getting too big for the kiddie rides
1638965 during the slow times i would visit the fun house with its wooden slides large wavy mirrors and spinning circle
1638966 the big dipper roller coaster the bumper cars the various rides and the games of skill were free with an employees pass
1638967 it was there at geauga lake park that my widowed mother met and married the park security policeman
1638968 after standing in line the two of us flew around the track
1638969 upon disembarking i noted that my boyfriends face was greener than my blouse
1638970 although the rides are gone i will always retain the memories of that day
1638971 it was a great job but no one else wanted to do it i mean all you had to do was yell at the kids spin em around make em throw up and then hose it all off and then go smoke a cigarette i made that job desirable
1638972 he called me up at 10 in the morning telling me the cops are after him and he needed to find a place to stay
1638973 i found him a place in beaverton some dudes house who was still living with his parents
1638974 weve been trying to get him to come out and play ever since we bought slabtown
1638975 but he had a lot of paranoia issues because of some unfinished legal business
1638976 its been about five years since ive even touched that stuff
1638977 but its stirring up all the really good memories instead of the bad knowing that those songs are going to be heard again
1638978 some of my favorite memories are when all of my friends would come and visit me at the amusement park and go nuts and get drunk on the rides or the basement of former 10 4 backdoor bandmates sara hot stix and joe pestilences house everything you could imagine and more happened in that basement you couldnt wash the walls down there youd have to burn the whole fucking house down

1639050 what was the biggest sacrifice youve had to make in your life and how did you get through it
1639051 women are better now were strong we can do it
1639052 i think they were a fairly premeditated way of controlling the weaker people in his life
1639053 did you reach for a knife when you were in the kitchen
1639054 our next guest plays a woman who tries very very hard not to make her boyfriend very angry
1639055 id never hit your mom no matter what you never hit women
1639056 i didnt hit her i was just trying to move through the doorway
1639057 were hitting it off and lets get down to business but wait you cant do shit unless your friend nails my pal over here and if she doesnt tell her to hit the bricks
1639058 listen now that ive got you all drunk were going to have sex and im going to videotape it too because you women lie when youre drunk and have sex you cry rape because im famous and you think you can scam me
1639059 it was gods plan for me to meet you so you better put out
1639060 some of the most vicious narrow minded and vulgar correspondences ive received on any subject
1639061 of course my good friend the vice president will be there
1639062 hey cover up or theyll see youre a woman and rape you
1639063 well yea duh shed get attacked or raped if she did scenario

1639065 the government has put forward a bill that would result in grocery stores smaller than 150 square metres losing their right to sell wine and beer associate justice minister lianne dalziel said the bill would be a conscience vote and she hoped it would be sent to a select committee before this parliament was dissolved

1639070 the u s will sustain its position of a sole superpower and exert significant influence on global military and political developments
1639071 i dont see either nation as a threat to the united states at this point
1639072 but they both are investing in modernization programs that are of concern
1639073 days before the olympic games begin and as all eyes turn to china we appeal to the world to remember that millions of tibetans are crying out for human rights and freedom
1639074 around 2030 according to some estimates the social security system is going to plain collapse unless we make the social security tax 30 percent and that wouldnt fly politically
1639075 need approximately 41 trillion invested today to deliver on the currently promised benefits not covered by earmarked revenues for the next 75 years
1639076 a lot of people say its between 60 and 70 trillion dollars
1639077 and the unfunded liability means that in order to pay for all of the problems congress needs to put in the bank 60 trillion and keep in mind our gdp gross domestic product is only 15 or 14 trillion dollars
1639078 capitalism has been so successful in eliminating the traditional problems of mankind that is disease pestilence famine hunger and gross poverty that all other human problems appear to us to be at once unsuitable and unbearable
1639079 as a result of this widespread control by the government in an effort to achieve these so called higher objectives we are increasingly being subordinated to the point where personal liberties are but secondary or tertiary matters
1639080 the only way that government can give one american citizen one dollar is to first through intimidation threat and coercion confiscate that one dollar from another american
1639081 as long as we recognize the power within us we will continue to have choices and we will continue to lead
1639082 a war dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies
1639083 you have to know what youre talking about you cant grandstand
1639084 theyll have to use their imagination as to how they can get a vote
1639085 the people got up and looked around and saw the mountain lions tail leaving the house
1639086 it is kind of strange for a large predator like that to come that close to the house
1639087 understands that in south america there is a legitimate peaceful and democratic revolutionary process underway
1639088 obviously hezbollah has hijacked the government in lebanon and now is in a position to veto decisions
1639089 the right of lebanons people army and resistance to liberate
1639090 of the consequences of destabilizing the very delicate balance that exists in lebanon
1639091 the fragile balance of forces in lebanon is unraveling and the world is playing deaf
1639092 the iranians are on the offensive in lebanon iraq and gaza
1639093 part of it is definitely government part of it is definitely free market
1639094 part of it is definitely just general citizens who all have to take a role and figure out what can i do and how to best do it
1639095 on the one hand its crucial for us to be starting with strategies that focus on people working when they are able to do so at the same time work needs to pay enough for those who are working to be out of poverty and that requires a combination of what happens in the market and public support
1639096 the problem with the welfare system is that it discourages work and marriage and therefore is not very helpful in raising peoples incomes
1639097 so to the extent that you have a welfare system it has to be a welfare system that rewards constructive behavior rather than rewarding dependence and self destructive behavior which is what the current welfare system does
1639098 i mean theres always going to be people who are unable to defer gratification and plan for the future
1639099 i think the governments main role should be making sure that communities are safe
1639100 youre not going to have businesses moving in to areas where they fear for the safety of their employees but as far as providing people with the means to seize economic opportunity im not sure beyond public safety and schools what can be done
1639101 i dont think we can rely on the free market to completely resolve things nor can we rely on government to take care of everything either
1639102 is not the most accurate reflection of poverty so thats why we had different folks from both panels talking about finding that definition and making it more reflective of current conditions today
1639103 in 1971 only about 32 percent of all americans enjoyed air conditioning in their homes by 2001 76 percent of poor people had air conditioning
1639104 in 1971 only 43 percent of americans owned a color television in 2001 97 percent of poor people owned at least one in 1971 1 percent of american homes had a microwave oven in 2001 73 percent of poor people had one
1639105 forty six percent of poor households own their homes only about 6 percent of poor households are overcrowded the average poor american has more living space than the average non poor individual living in paris london vienna athens and other european cities
1639106 nancy pelosi has said no to a vote on a comprehensive energy bill
1639107 i find it incredible that the american public cant hear whats going on in the house of representatives because nancy pelosi chose to turn off the lights and microphones rather than have an up or down vote on a comprehensive energy plan
1639108 shes jetting around this country shes on a five week vacation the american people cant afford a vacation many of them nancy pelosi needs to call this house back into session and we need an up or down vote on energy policy
1639109 madam speaker what are you afraid of give us a vote
1639110 this republican hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to reduce the price at the pump and promote energy independence
1639111 it was pretty exciting to get on the floor to see it live
1639112 i like the idea that republican house members are raising the questions i think energy is very important to the american people right now
1639113 i was surprised there was no media coverage there were no cameras on so people can understand whats going on in our government
1639114 my understanding is that its going to be 50 miles out and not something that is obtrusive on nature in terms of the environment so im for it

1639117 be brought before international justice designed for these kind of acts such as the international criminal court
1639118 the crime of impunity has gone on too long and the united states felt that it was time to stand up on this point of moral clarity and make clear that this permanent member of the security council will not compromise on the issue of justice
1639119 used to serve the narrow political interests of influential parties
1639120 tens of thousands of innocent iraqis and afghanis who have lost their lives as a result of a deliberate act of war against them by the united states
1639121 a significant step towards limiting the impunity exercised by government regimes in the arab world
1639122 that many within the arab region seeking or advocating for the immunity of sudanese officials
1639123 there were some people in the courtroom that were taken aback by it
1639124 those were the only words i heard him utter in the courtroom
1639125 he shook his head in response to questions from the judge some shakes of his appeared to be in the affirmative some of them appeared to be in the negative
1639126 i see this season as more of a transition i want to put my foot in the door and get more run outs
1639127 machines are tearing up the alpine in farnham creek headwaters as we speak
1639128 impaired driving driving with blood alcohol content over 08 and dangerous driving
1639129 we just heard a loud bang and somebody yelling screaming my head my head and then we saw flames in the ravine
1639130 what were left with is two people on the road and one decides his car is better than the other they either accelerate down the road or leave a stop sign together or just decide im going to get there before he does somebody runs out of control and you get a tragic consequence
1639131 in the past two years weve purchased 12 covert vehicles that are out on the road to deal specifically with aggressive drivers and you wont be able to tell them apart from the soccer moms or the drug dealers
1639132 this is a very artificial type of situation where you have human swimmers entering the water with the animals thats certainly going to have a behavioural impact on the animals themselves
1639133 theyll get a hug and a kiss from the sea lion its always popular the fishy kiss
1639134 it does look very promising we have two front players who will get goals and that is the key to it all
1639135 if we carry it on well be a difficult team to play against
1639136 the fans are right to have the confidence that we can go up thats for sure
1639137 there is a problem with the server please try again later
1639138 the typical bbc iplayer user is a man aged about 40 in a full time job with a partner but no kids he uses bbc iplayer at home over a fast broadband connection and accesses it on a desktop pc in the evenings usually on his own though sometimes his girlfriend watches something with him
1639139 when the mall first opened in 1969 it was called holly hill mall and was one of the largest malls in the state
1639140 it has used its massive public funding and resources brand potency unrivalled distribution network and cross promotional opportunities to become the most powerful media brand in the world and the lead uk player in television radio and on the internet
1639141 now it is seeking to extend that market leadership into the provision of local news and information
1639142 our goal is to bring even more people to the table and provoke thought facilitate discussion and inspire future design directions for firefox the mozilla project and the web as a whole
1639143 be bold be radical the crazier the better lets explore the future together
1639144 we just had a quick look and weve still got about 30 available for selection but that includes every available player
1639145 it includes a couple of players who havent played for us yet and it includes a couple of young players that arent in what we consider good enough form to be considered
1639146 its fair to say our 25 might have players that we dont think are in good enough form and not good enough form in terms of their last week but overall theyre going okay
1639147 its fairly thin but overall we could possibly go in with only one change this week with staker out so thats a bonus
1639148 josh kennedy tried to train on monday and push off and couldnt go flat out he couldnt run with the way his knee was
1639149 its a pretty bad injury that if he doesnt fix it now he risks having a thumb that doesnt work for the rest of his life
1639150 he will probably play the week after so it gives him one or two games at williamstown and then maybe one or two in the seniors before the finals
1639151 under an arthroscope the bone is still a bit soft but he cant do any more damage to it so hes just got to get through that pain barrier and we know hes a very tough individual
1639152 its just a matter of getting some games into him and having that match conditioning
1639153 higgins as a younger player hes needing longer than a scott west would
1639154 you feel for him because his injuries have been anything but minor hes more than frustrated and he was very upset on the weekend but the scan and prognosis is a lot better than we thought it would be so that should give him some hope
1639155 were not resting anyone i used the wrong word i suppose a better way of putting it is we have a no risk policy
1639156 anyone we think might be at risk on the weekend wont play but we wont be resting any player just for rests sake
1639157 you dont want to lose the last four games and then all of sudden you come into finals without any form behind you get the best of foxtel
1639158 so far dab has largely failed to catch on in cars more because its not widely offered by carmakers than because listeners dont want it
1639159 creates a soundfield that not only fills the room but also envelops listeners in breathtaking surround sound effects
1639160 i met them last night they are so friendly amp lt
1639161 most of my friends dont even know that there is
1639162 i met them last night they are so friendly amp lt
1639163 most of my friends dont even know that there is
1639164 provided he doesnt trip over a pothole or something like that hes pulled up fine and he moved well
1639165 its been a pretty cautious approach for gaz i think perhaps in years gone by you might have rushed a player back say last week but hes just making sure hes ticked all the boxes
1639166 garys form up until he got injured was as good as ive ever seen
1639167 probably since hes been injured jimmys form has been as good as garys was so it would be nice to sit there on brownlow night and see one of the boys win it
1639168 but theres so many good players out there and thats a really tough one
1639169 last year there was a whole lot of expectation and the unknown was really exciting and it was new it was fresh all those sorts of things
1639170 a lot of anxiety crept in about this time of year we were probably a bit gung ho to get towards the finals
1639171 our form not necessarily dropped off but fluctuated probably plateaued a little bit
1639172 this year im not thinking about winning a premiership like i was last year as such so its more of a level headed approach
1639173 just think soon your baby sister will be talking what do you think her first words will be what will she say to you
1639174 our customers asked for in flight connectivity and were responding by rolling out the most extensive wi fi network in the sky beginning this fall our passengers will have the ability to stay connected when they travel with us throughout the continental us
1639175 the advent of air to ground atg technology has made broadband connectivity in the cabin economically viable for the first time for commercial airlines
1639176 we are seeing ssd interest in a variety of applications where historically hard disk drives have reigned
1639177 for many the most logical place is in notebook computers but there is incredible value for ssds in enterprise server systems
1639178 as security threats become more sophisticated the global security community must combine its resources
1639179 the media seems preoccupied at the moment about peoples dna being stored centrally but the reality is that the database is really a one dimensional invasion of citizens privacy
1639180 not only do you have the numbers called and the locations called from but you have a time based diary from which you can extrapolate their movements
1639181 this has been a highly charged subject for years not least due to the progressive extension of the scope of the database culminating in recent proposals to include young children who might offend in the future or indeed everyone in the country

1639184 i love it i come into hair and make up now and its 10 minutes instead of two hours its way more fun to play frumpy then you can focus on story and character as opposed to having to always look great i feel like shes dealing with a lot of real issues
1639185 ninety per cent of over six trillion business emails this year will be spam
1639186 this volume puts it resources under an incredible strain to manage not only the spam but the ensuing backscatter just recently an isp was driven offline while trying to absorb 10 000 backscatter messages per second
1639187 eric told me his he is prepared to fist fight osu coaches jim heacock and tavier johnson for fellows
1639188 they almost caught me but i went hey melvin fell in the little hole they got there but he popped out and now hes a buckeye

1639193 looking forward to q3 we see that the environment is more challenging than we previously expected in general customers have adopted a cautious attitude due to the rising uncertainty in the global economy
1639194 umc will continue to focus on operational efficiency and cost control activities through an emphasis on teamwork and execution we will continue to invest in the development of advanced technologies that are critical to our future growth and profitability
1639195 we are investing heavily to improve our network and this investment is one step closer to our goal of becoming the best uk network for coverage and reliability by 2009
1639196 we are satisfied that google is putting in place adequate safeguards to avoid any risk to the privacy or safety of individuals including the blurring of vehicle registration marks and the faces of anyone included in streetview images
1639197 although it is possible that in certain limited circumstances an image may allow the identification of an individual it is clear that google is keen to capture images of streets and not individuals
1639198 images are not real time and there is a delay between taking an image and its publication so that it could not be used to make decisions about an individuals current whereabouts
1639199 i suggest the introduction of transmission rate caps which would allow users to purchase access to the internet at a given minimum data rate and be free to transfer data at least up to that rate in any way they wish
1639200 clicking on a link can take you to an unexpected streaming site or a major file transfer
1639201 broadband carriers should not be in the business of picking winners and losers in the market under the rubric of network management
1639202 i believe investment next generation access nga is essential for bt and it should generate a good return for decades to come
1639203 on the other hand if bt doesnt renew its local loop infrastructure its existing copper network will be worth only scrap value within 10 years
1639204 fibre in the local loop combined with bts 21cn twenty first century network project allows bt to provide a complete ip internet protocol based telecoms environment to the end user customers should get more flexibility for less cost and dreams like seamless fixed mobile convergence will become reality
1639205 by offering new and better services saving on operating costs and having a relatively low capital cost to recover bt stands to make good margins on this first phase of its next generation investment
1639206 we estimate they would need to earn only about 3 per month per household for a good return
1639207 of course even 3 a month would be a heavy extra burden to put on the price of broadband services but the 3 is for the partial replacement of what broadband customers are already buying not for something additional
1639208 one approach portrays the perpetrators as good people and the victims as evil ones who committed outrages during their travel through central and southern utah the second approach looks at the innocence of the emigrants and the evil of the killers who at best are described as followers of a misguided religion

1639216 you need to do this this and this or else this will happen
1639217 if we dont get a strong number oil prices will likely fall further
1639218 elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1639219 i expect prices to fall to between 100 and 110 by the end of the year
1639220 its a little scary at the start but sometimes that can be to your advantage because you feel like you have nothing to lose
1639221 i was playing catch up and had to find something to strike so i was lucky when i changed balls that i found something
1639222 off my hand that shot felt pretty good but i may have missed it a little bit at the bottom
1639223 i thought i made the spare but the headpin just wrapped around the 10 i made really good shots and you cant always say that when you bowl on tv so i have no regrets
1639224 i was a bit nervous in the first match because it was the first time ive been on tv in the states
1639225 in the second match i was a bit more relaxed and i touched up the surface of the ball i was throwing so that gave me a bit more room and allowed me to feel more loose
1639226 having your voice listened to is a privilege not a right and its a privilege thats earned in proportion to the contribution level not volume level

1639249 we would like to buy their share if the project is still profitable
1639250 we are currently negotiating with shell to buy their stake together with e on but if the project must be completed in time for the olympic games in 2012 then something must happen very soon and a decision must be taken shortly
1639251 it shows you how the music business remains a very questionable business over the next couple of years
1639252 it remains to be seen if it could be valuable or not
1639253 at the top we dont feel the artists are much affected
1639254 the artists that are likely to suffer are going to be the ones on the margin
1639255 these major developments are great news for stockport town centre despite all the talk of the credit crunch weve got developers who can see the great potential of stockport and were helping them move forward
1639256 the 30ft crane at st peters square is a highly visible symbol of our ambitious vision for the town centre our masterplan future stockport was designed to unlock the towns full potential and this landmark building will not only create an exciting new gateway into the centre but will also attract major employers to invest in the town creating new jobs
1639257 after all the ground works the crane is a significant milestone because the building will really begin to take shape now
1639258 it was violent and scary there were around 20 of them and they were all drunk i saw five of them lay into this one lad and another came up and smacked him with a bottle
1639259 he collapsed and his face was covered in blood he had a gash from his nose to his lip and you could see right through but he said he didnt want the police calling
1639260 it was all up and down the street and they were grabbing anything they could to be used as a weapon they were wild
1639261 i was told it was pre arranged and to close up on saturday afternoon im glad i did it was a disgrace ive only had to close three times in 22 years once for a gas leak and twice when city have played county
1639262 there was a group in here they finished their drinks stood up took their chairs and ran outside after another group they werent regulars we wont allow that sort of bahaviour
1639263 they were literally taking on agency staff every other day these people who were coming in were not trained absolutely no training at all by the end the security guard was marking papers
1639264 we were sat in rooms working with the curtains drawn because of the press
1639265 there were papers all over the floor from different packets of papers getting mixed up you literally had to step over them
1639266 no supervisors were there when you needed them the manager actually said and i quote if we dont get these done by friday im going to get fired so they took on anybody and everybody
1639267 everybody was coming from office angels most of them from stockport

1639295 as propaganda it is nearly as bad as the nazis in the second world war
1639296 to make a remark like that is completely out of order inappropriate and not in context
1639297 i find this comment very unfortunate i am surprised a councillor has gone down this route as it is offensive
1639298 it was an inappropriate phrase to use but it gmptas campaign is verging on propaganda
1639299 i went to a seminar about it by the time i came out i was almost convinced it was a good thing the general public are going to get completely the wrong idea
1639300 a better idea to get rid of congestion is to ban traffic from manchester centre or increase charges in car parks by 3 a day but that would hit businesses in the city centre
1639301 its something that certainly has a potential business application its printing related and its certainly novel
1639302 i was walking down the stairs when i heard a thud behind me and it took me a few moments to realise it was dad on the floor
1639303 he was in a really awkward position unconscious covered in blood and he wasnt breathing
1639304 training from a course i had been on just kicked in and i was giving my dad first aid until the paramedics arrived
1639305 i dont suppose he even thought about it for such a short trip to ireland it wasnt as if we were going half way around the world or for a long period of time
1639306 the irish medical care has been fantastic but theres a bed for him at the ormskirk unit

1639314 saya tetap mendaftarkan perkahwinan dengan wan ismail di mahkamah ini walaupun sudah diceraikan kerana mahu mahkamah berlaku adil terhadap nasib saya dan dua anak yang masih kecil hasil perkongsian hidup dengan suami selama lima tahun lalu
1639315 bagaimanapun saya reda dengan kejadian ini kerana mungkin sudah ditakdirkan jodoh antara kami habis tapi berharap wan ismail akan lebih bertanggungjawab terhadap dua anaknya yang masih kecil selain berharap kes ini selesai secepat mungkin
1639316 jangan disebabkan sudah ada pengganti wan ismail sanggup meninggalkan darah daging sendiri yang memerlukan kasih sayang dan pembelaan sewajarnya
1639317 discussions are ongoing but not between us and wolves between wolves and stephen
1639318 i dont think wolves boss mick mccarthy would deny stephen the opportunity to play league one football with us
1639319 were offering him that opportunity and i know stephens raring to go i would expect him to be in our squad for saturdays game
1639320 i know stephen would be very disappointed if he wasnt
1639321 we had to play them at some point but we can get them out of the way first
1639322 ill just have to make sure i walk into the right changing room it will be a bit strange going back
1639323 im just enjoying it and getting used to a different type of training than i was used to at newcastle
1639324 every conditioner puts their own stamp on how they want to do things and obviously steve walsh is slightly different to the guys who are back at newcastle
1639325 everyone here seems really friendly and now im looking forward to actually playing the games theres only so much training you can do
1639326 id looked round sale a couple of times before and i was encouraged by the ambition of the club and the chance to play in the heineken cup was massive as well its just a case now that all the lads as a team have got to perform to the levels were expecting from ourselves
1639327 fingers crossed well have a good season finish up there in the league and qualify for the group stages of the heineken cup
1639328 its obviously going to be fairly new for everyone involved so well have to see how it comes together
1639329 but i think everyone is pretty hopeful that with a bit more time together and a bit more preparation for games we can pick up some results after what was a disappointing summer tour
1639330 we had been banished out of the bar areas and into our living quarters
1639331 mel sneakily switched on the cameras to see what was going on
1639332 i saw them quite clearly at first i thought they were the television crew but then mel reminded me there were only two of them and they were both in the cellar
1639333 i hear the children crying in the night and i cant sleep it is driving me mad
1639334 i saw a stranger walk past me and into the gents
1639335 i followed him in but there was nobody there after that his presence became a common occurrence i am not scared
1639336 she is terrified and will not go near certain spots in the pub
1639337 one glass whirled around a ouija board without anyone touching it and another crashed to the floor with no human contact at all
1639338 the cellar is cold any way but there are spots that are so icy it makes your spine tingle it makes you shudder but mel says we should be more scared of the living than the dead

1639340 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1639341 its a bit opportunistic because all the mining shares have been so battered in the last six weeks or so
1639342 obviously xstrata has taken advantage of market weakness mining shares have got so ridiculously cheap i suppose its not impossible there will be bids for others
1639343 theyd say this has nothing to do with me or i dont know enough about this
1639344 they did not seem to be very involved politically at all

1639346 i was part of the process during that part of my life civil rights anti war protests
1639347 this is their country and this is their future we just want them to be participate
1639348 that was important to me that we open up a dialogue so that people leave talking about what affects them

1639355 the blue jays had the most winners it looks like were all doing a good job
1639356 there hasnt been any talk of me moving up quite yet
1639357 for me to move up someone ahead of me has to be moved up to the majors then a spot could open up for me its always a possibility to go to the majors at anytime i am hoping for my chance but right now i am happy to be here in lansing and be with the blue jays the organization has great people from top to bottom and i am really happy to be where i am
1639358 theyve been very loyal to me very fair to me right now my dream job would be to get to double a and the new hampshire fisher cats

1639361 thomas was working on his hitting and they needed a trainer to go watch and make sure he didnt get hurt
1639362 so for a week i worked with frank thomas he was the best just awesome hes a class act and a great guy just being able to see his work ethic was incredible hes a hall of fame hitter one of the best players
1639363 once he found out i was from maine he kind of took me under his wing
1639364 hes one of the best first class all the way
1639365 the best part of my job is helping players and the challenge of keeping players healthy so they can develop and eventually move up the system
1639366 the worst part is being away from home being away from my friends and family in york
1639367 theres really nothing about the job i dont like i dont even mind the long bus rides i want to thank my mother and father because without them i certainly wouldnt be where i am today they are my motivation
1639368 we had such a good time last year and the kids wanted to keep playing
1639369 there are a lot of club teams not town teams were stepping up the competition a little bit playing against these club teams it should be fun

1639384 its a bit of a worry but dominic trained on tuesday and paul will resume later in the week
1639385 if either player doesnt make it for saturday though then they will certainly be available for our two games next week against leicester
1639386 its not an injury crisis but its just a shame that all our three injury concerns surround midfielders
1639387 we looked a little flat in the first half but in the second we were really sparring with each other the game opened up and we had a right go dont forget we were up against 11 top quality players and seven more followed in the second half
1639388 i thought we acquitted ourselves well though and we deserved to win
1639389 there were plenty of good signs out there for me i was really pleased with our performance

1639430 the ultimate aim of writing lies in its ethical effects to improve society inform individuals expand knowledge assist communities and so on
1639431 whenever you write you borrow ideas phrases images sounds details from others and then you weave those pieces into a new cloth

1639462 i go to the beach very often and i see young children playing in the storm runoff
1639463 i wanted to post it so people would be aware
1639464 our cottage is close to a storm drain and some days the water will be pretty odiferous
1639465 you have to walk through that water if you want to walk along the beach
1639466 many folks dont think about the fact that what they do in upland areas can influence beach and ocean water quality
1639467 for instance when we do beach cleanups the no 1 item we pick up are cigarette butts these come mostly from storm drains not people throwing their butts on the beach
1639468 the water quality is very good at all of our beaches
1639469 typically speaking our beaches are testing clean all the time
1639470 we have been doing extensive testing in the outfall at short sands
1639471 we tested in the outfall and followed the brook testing seven places above it all of them passed
1639472 its brackish water coming out of swamps and across peoples yards and out of parking lots it heads for the lowest point which is the beach
1639473 we use it as an indicator as to whether or not there are issues somewhere else
1639474 the question now is what is the source is it a manure pile upstream or agriculture or a leaky septic system
1639475 we dont want issues on the beach when it is too late
1639476 we are headed for what might be a crisis situation this winter
1639477 it is unprecedented the speed with which it is increasing it is draining a lot of cash out of the economy
1639478 this is an unprecedented time where even experts dont know whats driving all the forces
1639479 there is no consensus on whether or not the price is going to go up or come down

1639484 we have a bucket on the counter for the york community food pantry and i had noticed there was some bills in there
1639485 i saw some bills and i opened the top and i saw a 50 bill so i pulled it out and i realized it wasnt one it was six six 50 bills i counted it once i counted it again i counted it three times
1639486 they came with the idea that they were going to do that the only way people would have known that is if they saw the article
1639487 three hundred dollars to us means we can buy about 1 200 of food from the food bank

1639494 kemudian beliau mengambil dua pelepah kurma yang masih basah kemudian membelahnya menjadi dua lalu menancapkannya pada masing masing kuburan itu seraya bersabda

1639501 artinya dan tidaklah kami menjadikan bilangan mereka itu melainkan untuk jadi cobaan bagi orang orang kafir supaya orang orang yang diberi al kitab yakin dan supaya orang orang yang beriman bertambah imannya
1639502 artinya dan apabila diturunkan suatu surat maka diantara mereka orang orang munafik ada yang berkata siapa di antara kamu yang bertambah imannya dengan turunnya surat ini adapun orang yang beriman maka surat ini menambah imannya sedang mereka merasa gembira dan adapun orang orang yang di dalam hati mereka ada penyakit maka dengan surat itu bertambah kekafiran mereka di samping kekafirannya yang telah ada dan mereka mati dalam keadaan kafir

1639516 a lot of companies we come across will not invest in anything that has a longer than three year return
1639517 many energy saving technologies such as new lighting or insulation can deliver big returns within three years but the larger projects such as chp combined heat and power smart building management systems and solar panels often require longer pay back periods

1639553 he gets called my dad my granddad you name it
1639554 i get it all the time and im sure people think thats why im in the team
1639555 ive been there since i was 12 and maybe he took a special interest because i was scottish but i know when i signed it didnt matter if you were scottish norwegian or whatever if you are not good enough you wont get in the team
1639556 ive been in the youth team with a lot of scottish players a lot of scottish players have been there and i dont think the manager would have had the success hes had if he only wanted scottish players in his team
1639557 i get a lot of people saying im only picked because im scottish and thats fine its water off a ducks back people will say what they want there is nothing you can do about that
1639558 we can talk about scottish football but at the same time hes talking to ronaldo and nani about the portuguese game
1639559 he loves his football that much that he goes home and watches all these games he will talk to me about celtic and rangers and the scotland game but at the same time he will talk about sporting lisbons game
1639560 you can say what you want i never came to manchester united because alex ferguson is scottish
1639561 i came to manchester united because they were the best team in the premier league and alex ferguson was the best manager
1639562 you want to learn from the best and if i didnt achieve it here i always said i could say i gave my best and if i came up short then fine
1639563 there is competition for places which drives you on but until you are at the stage when you are not needed then you have to move on
1639564 ive not felt like that but who knows what the future holds or when your time is up at united
1639565 the manager decides that or if you feel you are not helping the team or playing enough games and then it is time to go
1639566 but until that time comes im going to work hard and take every disappointment and use it as a fuel to get into the team
1639567 im starting to worry about whether we are going to have a team ready for the start of the season because nani is suspended anderson is at the olympics and i doubt if we will get rooney fit after the virus he has had
1639568 he picked it up in nigeria and its not a nice one its 12 days until the season starts and hes not been able to train
1639569 what are some examples of libelous and non libelous statements
1639570 some of the pre season games i have seen have been like basketball or netball matches with teams saying you have an attack and we will have an attack and very little contact
1639571 those kinds of matches do not prepare a side in the correct way and i anticipate that our next two matches against celtic tonight and ac milan on saturday will be nothing like that
1639572 now is the time that we are starting to look for performances from individuals and the team whereas up to this point it has to a certain extent been about getting fitness levels right and getting enough fitness into players legs
1639573 that is what we have been trying to do in early games but that will change from tonight onwards some players have really impressed me but others have a little bit more to do in that respect
1639574 i have been pleased with the work ethic the players have shown now we want to add to the quality of performance and hit the ground running tonight will be a big test
1639575 we will still split the squad so that not too much weight of work falls on too few players but we want to win the next two matches it helps momentum
1639576 there will be a special atmosphere tonight and there will be an edge i am sure celtic fans are renowned for turning up in vast numbers and having seen games up there before i know first hand that their support is unbelievable
1639577 in fairness i may take some of the younger players to sample the atmosphere because it is so unique and will stand them in good stead
1639578 we are an english club trying to win a european trophy to show the premier league in a good light but unfortunately we have become the victims of circumstance
1639579 we are deemed to be this countrys ninth ranked club in the european competitions and the numbers and draw would be wrong if they gave us a bye so we have been told we have to play in the second round the dates are not negotiable
1639580 the consequences of that are that we have to play four games in a week which is a big ask for anyone
1639581 if we could do that then maybe we will be able to look to give players a rest in the second leg but that is not a given
1639582 we cannot prioritise and we will not do that it promises to be an intense period but we are fit and strong and the squad should be able to cope with the demands
1639583 we accept that we will be a potential big scalp for someone in the carling cup and we will have to take each match on its merits

1639612 my hope is that as we stay consistent and focused and provide a respectful debate on the floor of the congress that more americans will see that there are members of congress that want to be working and are ready to role our sleeves up and achieve a bipartisan compromise that includes conservation new technologies fuel efficiency and more drilling

1639647 i am not jose mourinho so why compare me with him
1639648 but i am more modest than that i am from south brazil and in my culture i never say i will win this this or that
1639649 i want to make chelsea loved around the world like barcelona and manchester united
1639650 its a surprise for me that people say chelsea are unpopular because when we went to china they love chelsea there were many people there its a big surprise people dont like us in england here in russia in malaysia its even better but maybe not yet in brazil or south america
1639651 chelsea is a club that is a growing name before it was real madrid barcelona manchester united milan if we win one or two big competitions im sure well have fans all over the world maybe it wont be the same as madrid manchester or ac milan because our history is not the same and you dont make a history in two three or ten years maybe in 20 or 50 years chelsea will be on that level
1639652 i am not jos mourinho so why compare me with him
1639653 mourinho says i will win ten championships i dont say i will win ten i say i will try i am from south brazil were different ill say we will try to win all the competitions but in my culture ill never say i will win this this or that
1639654 im more modest maybe mourinho says i win and afterwards if he does not win it causes problems because the manager doesnt play its the players and if they make a mistake you then have to say it is the players who are bad and i will never do that you are the man who must take the responsibility
1639655 since i came to chelsea we have only spent 10million about 8million for deco
1639656 who else have we bought jos bosingwa was before me maybe they spend more money before but now they dont spend the same because they already have a base they need a coach to develop young players and i am that coach
1639657 if youre talking about penalties some players refuse to take one i need to change this mentality where some players are afraid of penalties because they dont want to be right or wrong

1639666 at the end of last season i thought we needed another top striker at the club and ive not changed that view because youve got to put the ball in the back of the net
1639667 ive told the lads we need to be more aggressive and play more attacking football and go at teams
1639668 we dont have to fear anyone or have respect for anyone we need to believe in ourselves

1639681 the tourism and travel industries are keeping us strong despite a slowdown in the national economy and we are adding new attractions to make sure this upward trend continues
1639682 this is the first time in my career which has spanned 33 years that i have ever seen a board of supervisors ever refuse to consolidate an election
1639683 im in the process of hiring outside counsel because we cant hire county counsel because they would have a conflict
1639684 we have a fairly decent chance of going into court and getting that reversed

1639687 the people of los angeles county should have the right to decide for themselves whether they want to invest in their future
1639688 there have been incidents of police but nothing like whats going on right now
1639689 for me i always thought it was a pretty good area
1639690 hes running as a fiscal conservative but then you look at how the campaign is being run the two dont add up
1639691 since the close of the financial reporting period five weeks ago
1639692 weve been working very hard and i think the results show
1639693 i think all of us sometimes choose to hear what we want to hear
1639694 but under the parameters we were given for the federal law we didnt have a choice
1639695 it was a tough decision for all of us because the state law and the federal law are at odds
1639696 virtually none of the evidence we wanted to present was presented
1639697 in that sense its not that surprising that the jury came to the decision it did
1639698 were pleased with the fact that the jury followed the law
1639699 because we had been successful with 100 pcr bottles in the u k we wanted to explore what could be done in the u s
1639700 when method came to us last year on this project we were hoping to get to 50 pcr content in our trials we tested 10 25 50 75 and 100 thats when we discovered that 100 pcr content was not out of the question but we knew we had a lot of work ahead of us before we could be confident that the bottles meeting all of the criteria could be produced at commercial rates
1639701 ideally you want the original pet bottles not to have been commingled with any other plastic type the best source from a material purity standpoint is pet carbonated soft drink bottles that have been collected from a deposit based program second best are bottles that have been curbside collected
1639702 additionally we needed to tap into a company that could provide the desired material quality on a consistent basis and who also has the technology to create pellets from the flake that results when these bottles are ground up
1639703 method and amcor engineers worked cooperatively with each other to overcome each of the material production and performance challenges that presented themselves throughout the project
1639704 not only has this been a learning experience for both amcor and method but resin suppliers have also benefited the end result is a bottle that is having a positive impact to the environment
1639705 a tide of safety and security is surging throughout the neighborhoods of our city
1639706 some frankly will take umbrage with that and im looking them in the eye and saying im moving forward im going to grow this police department
1639707 but more importantly is what we do with those cops what the hell difference does it make if i got 1 000 more cops if theyre not getting crime down so the public in this city every dime theyre spending on that trash fee is ultimately resulting in fewer victims of crime in this city lets get that straight
1639708 this isnt an administrative assistant were talking about a coo
1639709 and if he doesnt know that red flags will be raised about potential conflicts of interest in this case then i dont think he should be coo
1639710 clearly in the future we need to do something differently

1639739 over five million households without gas are paying double what they were last year to heat their homes
1639740 and this urban rural divide sadly also extends to two of the other essentials of life food and petrol or diesel
1639741 having to travel up to 20 miles to the nearest supermarket typically adds 6 in fuel costs so villagers are increasingly relying on the corner store
1639742 of course these shops cant buy in bulk like the major supermarkets so they have to charge more and they cant offer the same range of foods either
1639743 repossessions are an expensive business and should only be seen as the last resort
1639744 there are many potential short term solutions to plug the arrears gap that should be considered before going for repossession including the provision of special rates switching to interest only payment holidays or agreed payment plans
1639745 borrowers that are especially vulnerable at the moment are ones with impaired credit histories or those with only small amounts of equity
1639746 we urge all lenders to take the long term view when it comes to borrowers such as these and consider that the affordability squeeze is only temporary
1639747 our 2007 evidence report shows in some cases lenders have taken borrowers to court without exploring all the other options available to address the arrears resulting in excessive costs stress and worry for borrowers
1639748 this could be avoided if lenders had acted in accordance with the fsa rules that govern arrears management practices

1639770 we filed a petition today at 12 20pm against execution by firing squad as its considered torture
1639771 execution by shooting wont kill the convicts instantly the law states that if the first shot on the heart doesnt work they must be shot again to the head
1639772 the executions are one problem and the decision of the constitutional court is another problem there is no relationship
1639773 they have to wait until the court produces a decision otherwise the execution will be illegitimate
1639774 we know that all of the arctic states claim 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zones as theyre entitled to do

1639791 how many bowel movements do you have each day or each week
1639792 when i returned to the clinical practice of environmental and nutritional medicine after years of pathology work i began carefully testing the assertions of nutritionists naturopaths and clinical ecologist who claimed that various types of colitis a deterioration of your colon wall could be reversed with optimal nutritional and ecologic approaches to my great surprise i found that such professionals who are usually spurned by drug doctors were right after all my patients responded well to the unscientific therapies vehemently rejected by my colleagues in drug medicine
1639793 you must have roughage to make the bowels move freely concentrated food processed foods and constipation go hand in hand and then pills laxatives are used more constipation and more pills it is a vicious circle with bad results dont be afraid of cracked wheat cornmeal cut oats raw cabbage onions and celery they are far better than refined flour and the package foods that flood the market they may save some labor in the kitchen but they produce constipation
1639794 i made it plain i didnt want to be part of their covert activities after that i noticed that other senior officers at the council didnt come near me i felt on the periphery of an exclusive male club
1639795 the story is not the story the story is the drive by media turning on its favorite maverick and trying to take him out the media picked the gops candidate the nyt endorsed him while they sat on this story and is now with utter predictability trying to destroy him
1639796 this is what you get when you walk across the aisle and try to make these people your friends im not surprised in the least that the nyt would try to take out john mccain predicted this in fact way back in the early 2000s sen mccain courted the media cultivated them even bragged that the media was his base i cringed when i heard it because the media turning on mccain was as predictable as the sun rising in the morning
1639797 there are two kinds of change to choose from we can become the children of a europe like nanny state writ large with no america to protect us from ourselves or we can embrace a change that seeks to reduce government and embrace america exceptional ism

1639806 going to make it worse for us well have to fly from lax and the lines there are 10 times worse
1639807 they had pretty good fares and i could fly home nonstop i am going to have to find another way
1639808 the business community will take a bit of a hit here in its effort to get to destinations important to them
1639809 the big question is going to be how that affects fares
1639810 i want to be someone an injured marine can talk to

1639816 im in the process of hiring outside counsel because we cant hire county counsel because they would have a conflict
1639817 we have a fairly decent chance of going into court and getting that reversed
1639818 the taxpayers and voters will be the ultimate losers if the board refuses to place the mta measure on the general election ballot
1639819 a down payment toward the many transit and highway improvements this county needs to support our economy our environment the needs of the transit dependent and an overall high quality of life for the people we represent
1639820 the people of los angeles county should have the right to decide for themselves whether they want to invest in their future
1639821 uwaga miasto zap aci wam je li w nim zamieszkacie
1639822 encouraging employers to invest in skills can be the key to business success as research shows that companies which dont train are more than twice as likely to go out of business as those that do
1639823 this is a hugely complex issue and isnt something we can achieve in isolation we want to know whether people feel the current scale and type of employer investment in skills is right if its not why not and what can be done about it
1639824 when the marine and fisheries agency mfa caught the last three thames estuary fishermen with boats just over 10 metres long committing comparatively minor offences against the regulations it invoked a law designed to confiscate the assets of drug dealers and other serious criminals to punish the men so severely that they stand to lose all they possess
1639825 for a trivial offence a free man shall be fined only in proportion to the degree of his offence and for a serious offence correspondingly but not so heavily as to deprive him of his livelihood
1639826 a deal of this size at this stage is something of a brave move for adecco given the economic backdrop
1639827 when you talk to her youll see the things we saw in her
1639828 shes so vibrant and has such an outgoing personality i think the viewers will really kind of respond to her we think its going to be a home run

1639834 and should be with us on october 7 2008 since the last album the band have undergone something of a re jig
1639835 the band is heading in a direction that i would not feel comfortable following due to my personal beliefs my faith in god and my marriage to kerith are both higher priorities than i am ghost and i feel that if i were to continue in the band both of these would be stressed to compromise
1639836 can be excised from the album it has met with near universal dislike bordering on contempt from
1639837 our duck billed dinosaur grew three to five times faster than any potential predators that lived alongside it
1639838 by the time the duck billed dinosaur was fully grown the tyrannosaurs were only half grown it was a huge size difference
1639839 thats another added bonus when facing predators if you can keep reproducing youre set
1639840 we were shocked at how fast they grew if you look at a cross section of the bone of a nestling or even from within the egg there are huge spaces in which blood supply was going through the bone which means they were growing like crazy
1639841 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1639842 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
1639843 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1639844 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1639845 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded center contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1639846 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from m87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1639847 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of m87
1639848 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1639849 for decades the medial temporal lobe structures have been linked to both memory and spatial cognition
1639850 so we set out to test how these two abilities related to one another and to the temporal lobe area of the brain

1639858 with a possible recession looming and the threat of further regulatory intervention the outlook for continuing defined benefit provision seems rather bleak
1639859 events of the last year demonstrate the importance of assessing and managing pension risks and being prepared to take opportunities when they present themselves
1639860 they need to figure out how to educate and inform the rest of their workforce that is coming in possibly with an inferior pension scheme and keep them incentivised and rewarded so that theres a level playing field across the whole workforce which is a real challenge
