7620010 im not surprised the harper government is doing this because i think theyre very embarrassed the economy is softening and they have nothing to propose to canadians
7620011 i think its a charade harpers up to no good here
7620012 parliament is working parliament is not dysfunctional this is an invention by mr harper to trigger an election
7620013 most sensible people have realized that there is significant improvement on all the counts for which we have been criticized like our ability to do things our concern for the environment and for human rights
7620014 dont quote me but i really think china has made this possible precisely because of its centralized political structure
7620015 the olympic games will have a lot of positive effect the chinese government will care a lot more about the need for harmony in society i expect it to be more responsive to the problems of ethnic communities
7620016 the glory goes to the olympic family to athletes who have competed hard to volunteers from different parts of the world and to friends the world over who have been involved in the beijing olympic games in various ways
7620017 the most intangible legacy but also very important one is that through the games china has been scrutinized by the world has opened up to the world
7620018 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world i believe this is something that will have positive effects in the long term
7620019 the stocks of these companies are highly dependent on natural gas prices and shareholder acceptance of this deal will be predicated on what the valuations look like depending on how that changes
7620020 none of us are basing this deal on the price of gas in august

7620040 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7620041 it could be that the safety benefits of driving slower are proportionately greater than the fuel economy benefits
7620042 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7620043 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7620044 right now were in the middle of a cop sandwich

7620050 i noticed the cosmonaut seemed to be a slightly different type of person than the american astronaut
7620051 cosmonauts are primarily pilots and like test pilots they are very focused on getting the job done the current american astronauts are picked for things such as their speaking ability and social skills and most of them have advanced degrees but the cosmonaut struck me as an adventurous get things done type person like our original astronauts back in the 1960s
7620052 when we eliminate the need to launch off mars we remove the missions most daunting obstacle
7620053 but i dont think thats guaranteed any more than you would say climbing a mountain alone is a suicide mission people do dangerous things all the time and this would be something really unique to go to mars i dont think there would be any shortage of people willing to volunteer for the mission lindbergh was someone who was willing to risk everything because it was worth it i dont think it will be hard to find another lindbergh to go to mars that will be the easiest part of this whole program
7620054 i think people have forgotten how exciting the apollo program was and this would bring that excitement back
7620055 and it wasnt just here in the us the whole world was excited this enthusiasm would be the greatest effect of a program that places a man on mars over and above anything else whether it makes jobs or stimulates the economy or creates technology spinoffs were all humans and the idea of sending one of our kind on a trip like that would be a wonderful adventure for the entire world the whole world would get behind it
7620056 the astronauts on the international space station have an army of people on earth keeping track of what they are doing they really have no peace somebody is constantly planning and monitoring their activities i dont think being lonely will be much of a problem on a mission to mars
7620057 this person wouldnt be there by himself for very long its just returning home that would be impossible
7620058 i can remember during the early days of the apollo program there were even many more technical issues than we face today in going to mars
7620059 people dont realize that or have forgotten that fact several things were tremendous unknowns back then any one of which could have been a showstopper for a human moon landing
7620060 it was almost science fiction but someone thought it could be done in just a few years and sure enough the technology was perfected in time to make the mission possible
7620061 usually its the disenfranchised that are willing to take those kinds of risks
7620062 when our present situation no longer works for us we become more willing to take risks the difference between the folks who are interested and those who arent is their attachment to their current situation
7620063 they didnt get enough money to fix problems with the shuttle and theyve always been chronically short of money how we fund nasa is a big handicap since every year nasa has to go begging to congress for funds and justify their budget the chinese space program on the other hand has an advantage in that they budget their projects in five year increments if we really want to go somewhere well have to change how nasa gets its money
7620064 pay attention to me i am important and what i say counts
7620065 disabled american veterans dav has given mccain a 20 percent rating and barack obama 80 percent when supporting its issues
7620066 we believe such activities would seriously harm the davs ability to effectively represent disabled veterans before congress the white house the department of veterans affairs and other government agencies and departments it would threaten our tax exempt status to become involved in any way with the political process those members count on us to advocate their needs as disabled veterans and the dav concentrates its attention and resources on this single narrowly defined nonpartisan cause we hope this explanation is sufficient to answer your questions about the davs position on politics

7620073 not in compliance with the ceasefire and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7620074 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7620075 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7620076 should go back to the situation before the hostilities started
7620077 the idea is that yes for a temporary period some russian peace forces could stay on next to the border line of ossetia but its temporary it should be for patrolling and it should be until we have an international mechanism
7620078 it was clearly stated that this presence first has to be through patrolling no fixed presence and second should not have an effect on the freedom of movement on roads and trains in this place

7620098 holding the olympics was good in terms of china taking a more democratic path we believe this is an irreversible path
7620099 while the reformist open door policy is said to be making progress in china it is not always leaping forward
7620100 i think our friends in china have hosted a highly successful olympic games
7620101 lets remember that these games have been free of violence and this is a very uncertain world that we live in
7620102 i dont know of a single olympic games in recent history which has not generated controversy of one sort or another
7620103 we have to be clear here it is not about the medium pacers it is for the breed that bowls genuinely quick they have to be preserved and if it means they have to miss a few games it should not bother them
7620104 it is impossible for a baseball pitcher to keep doing it everyday and same for a sprinter he has to be given time to recuperate it is no different for a fast bowler it is impossible to keep doing it without a break
7620105 it is how a bowler improves over a period as they are all supposed to be rusty at the start of the season it is vital to have a good buildup to the season as there is very little time once the season starts the key is to reserve the best as no one wants to be bowling at their best during practice it is crucial a bowler is prepared
7620106 i got stymied behind the tree and i got lucky because i got a drop because of some gopher holes or whatever it was
7620107 to walk outside the gate of ones home feels like walking in a field of mines
7620108 since these wickets are slow the part timers can be effective but we don t have part timers like virender sehwag or sachin tendulkar who can really turn the ball and stay consistent so you have to see who s bowling well and continue with him
7620109 if he mendis bowls a bad ball you need to punish him only then will pressure build on him if you keep defending he ll stay on top till now he wasn t under pressure so he was bowling at his best
7620110 we had a good conditioning camp in mysore we are ready for the tour
7620111 there are a few players in the squad who have played there before we have experienced players i m sure we can give them a good fight and make our country proud
7620112 the significant structural and economic changes in the marketplace are prompting all automakers to further refine actions to respond to these pressures
7620113 at bmw were responding with a number of internal efficiency improvements to offset our increased costs so that we can keep this price increase modest

7620121 when prices were good i was able to build a house i got a wife and i was able to raise my family
7620122 then the buyers started dropping prices i was facing losses in terms of what i had invested in the farm in buying fertilizers pesticides seeds and labour i could not recover
7620123 in those days french beans would give you a good pay people were planting french beans all over
7620124 but the prices are preventing us from farming french beans they are getting lower and lower farmers are running into debt
7620125 prices were bad the whole of last year 60 of our production was not bought and we fed the cows with it
7620126 it has become more and more of a challenge to address all this the fuel prices the cost of inputs has gone up and at the same time there is a lot of competition from other countries
7620127 kenya strayed from sustainable farming and followed the temptation of exporting when its clearly preferable to produce and consume locally
7620128 with subsistence farming theres more or less always a market for your products but when french or european retailers no longer want beans then kenya will be left with nothing
7620129 kenya can try to cash in on exports to neighbouring countries but exports to europe are a lost cause due to the soaring cost of transport the issue of carbon emissions farmers should not waste time in shifting the focus back to indigenous crops
7620130 encouraging subsistence farming is another way of taking kenyan farmers out of the international market chain and confining them to poverty

7620147 the horrors of the second world war gave impetus to a quest for universal peace justice and human dignity with the united nations at the fore it is a disturbing commentary on our quest that as we commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights palestinians mark six decades of what they refer to as the nakba or catastrophe with many languishing in conditions of exile exclusion and isolation this is a testament to our collective failure to give meaning to human dignity for palestinians and to achieve a lasting just peace in the middle east we who serve palestine refugees believe that there is time to make amends exile for sixty years palestine refugees have been in exile from their ancestral lands nowhere is this more starkly visible than in the west bank where the illegal barrier hundreds of checkpoints and physical obstructions daily reinforce the exile and in gaza the policies of closure and indiscriminate punishment devastate lives causing mass despair threatening to destroy hopes for peace exclusion palestine refugees also face exclusion from the justice afforded by international law the aim of which is to offer the protection security and dignity taken for granted in a world where respect for human rights and the rule of law have become guiding principles of global governance embodied in the canons of international law are clear prohibitions against systematic attacks against civilian populations against deliberately depriving civilians of food against the intentional destruction of civilian infrastructure and against the transfer of an occupying powers population onto the land it occupies the violations of these and other provisions serve to underscore among palestinians a sense of exclusion from the protection of the international system

7620165 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7620166 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7620167 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7620168 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7620169 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7620170 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe

7620176 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7620177 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7620178 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7620179 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7620180 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7620181 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7620182 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7620183 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record

7620185 to ensure we would be in a position to get the settings right and provide continuity during a difficult period
7620186 nothing changed expect to the extent that when we extended mikes contract we believed and we were absolutely right that we were entering a very difficult environment
7620187 we wanted to have the option of security of tenure we also wanted mike to get the setting right for us as we got into the storm
7620188 we believe weve probably passed through the eye of the storm
7620189 weve had that continuity and weve now come to an agreement with mike that he step down

7620198 in many respects this finding is not surprising as we have heard for many months from leaders in the metal forming fabricating and welding industries that their biggest challenge today is finding skilled workers especially young people who can tackle the increasingly sophisticated tasks required in manufacturing today
7620199 in fact one keynote speech at the upcoming exposition by renowned inventor dean kamen will address this very issue and several seminars will explore the topic
7620200 those last three findings underscore the need for our educational system to step up and emphasize curriculum that can better prepare students for positions available today in manufacturing

7620245 the rate of grade 3 toxicity from 3dcrt with 78 gy in 2 0 gy fractions remains better than expected compared to historical controls however low grade late toxicity is significantly higher in dose level v than dose level iii these differences may be dose and or volume related
7620246 tolerance to three dimensional conformal radiotherapy with 74 gy in 2 gy fractions remains better than expected compared with historical controls the magnitude of any effect from fraction size requires additional follow up
7620247 this multicenter controlled phase iii trial failed to confirm the efficacy of betaseron in patients receiving definitive radiotherapy for locally advanced nonmetastatic non small cell lung cancer the use of beta interferon led to greater rates of both acute and late treatment related toxicity

7620255 results of this trial regarding psa response and clinical disappearance of disease are similar to historical controls and do not warrant further investigation of etanidazole as was done in this trial
7620256 patients with unresectable alpha fetoprotein positive hepatocellular carcinoma experienced improved survival and decreased toxicity when managed with post induction cycles of intra arterial cisplatin as compared with intravenous doxorubicin and 5 fu intravenous 131i polyclonal antiferritin did not improve survival when added to either post induction regimen but dramatically increased hematologic toxicities
7620257 the maximum tolerated dose of fractionated 2 50 gy hbi was found to be 17 5 gy the major dose limiting toxicity was hematological thromboleukopenia there was not a significant dose response effect on occult disease appearance of new disease or in the requirement for additional treatment although certain trends were noted for the higher doses when only patients completing assigned hbi from rtog 82 06 and 88 22 were compared there was no difference in the time to new disease or additional treatment in the treated field based on the investigative parameters of this study single high dose hbi was as effective as fractionated hbi
7620258 in patients with gleason score 2 6 carcinoma of the prostate a short course of androgen ablation administered before and during radiotherapy has been associated with a highly significant improvement in local control reduction in disease progression and overall survival
7620259 in a population of patients with unfavorable prognosis carcinoma of the prostate androgen suppression applied as an adjuvant after definitive rt was associated not only with a reduction in disease progression but in a statistically significant improvement in absolute survival the improvement in survival appeared preferentially in patients with a gleason score of 7 10

7620264 the study design could not credibly establish a safe dose for hepatic irradiation however it did succeed in determining that 33 gy in fractions of 1 5 gy is unsafe carrying a substantial risk of delayed radiation injury the absence of apparent late liver injury at the 27 gy and 30 gy dose levels suggests that a prior clinical trial of adjuvant hepatic irradiation in patients with resected colon cancer may have employed an insufficient radiation dose 21 gy to fully test the question
7620265 intravenous 131 i polyclonal antiferritin did not improve survival when added to either post induction regimen but dramatically increased hematologic toxicities
7620266 the results of the study indicate comparable efficacy using tumor clearance as an end point of des and megestrol although des appears more effective in suppressing testosterone it is also associated with a higher incidence of drug related toxicity
7620267 fraction size in external beam radiation therapy in the treatment of melanoma
7620268 these studies have demonstrated the toxicity and therapeutic activity of 131i antiferritin and the emerging role of radiolabelled antibody in cancer therapy
7620269 this clinical trial demonstrates that hbi has the potential to be used to treat systemic and occult metastases particularly if both halves of the body can be treated
7620270 present results suggest that further clinical studies with isotopic immunoglobulin are indicated
7620271 hbi achieves pain relief sooner and with less evidence of pain recurrence in the irradiated area than conventionally treated patients the most effective and safest of the hbi doses tested were 600 rad for the upper hbi and 800 rad for the lower or mid hbi
7620272 the results of the study revealed no statistically significant benefit of elective pelvic irradiation
7620273 periaortic irradiation was not associated with a significantly increased incidence of bowel injuries manifested by diarrhea no correlation between the total dose to the regional lymphatics ranging from 4400 to 5100 cgy and the incidence of bowel and bladder injuries could be established doses to the prostate in excess of 7000 cgy have not resulted in a significantly increased incidence of bladder injuries but have been associated with a significant increase in the incidence of bowel injuries manifested by diarrhea the techniques of pelvic irradiation did not seem to significantly influence the incidence of bowel or bladder complications the technique of delivery of the prostatic boost did seem to influence the incidence of bowel injuries this refers to the lateral boost technique and the perineal boost technique which have been associated with a higher incidence of diarrhea

7620421 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7620422 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7620423 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7620424 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7620425 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope

7620428 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7620429 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7620430 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day

7620445 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7620446 shes been as an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy and simon offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7620447 zondag was ik nog op de open dag van fc groningen en nu sta ik hier
7620448 ik heb al een heel goed gesprek met de trainer gehad en heb er ontzettend veel zin in ik had nog niet verwacht deze stap te maken maar dit is hartstikke mooi
7620449 ik realiseer me dat ik hier ben gehaald met het oog op de toekomst
7620450 ik moet naar mijn eigen ontwikkeling kijken en ga mijn uiterste best doen om het hier te maken
7620451 to be our best and perhaps only hope for a distinctively baptist witness
7620452 our conservative biblicism combined with our love for religious freedom our penchant for autonomous thought and practice combined with our passion for cooperation our disdain for hierarchical governance combined with our respect for accountability through congregational leadership our theological center of grace and grace alone combined with our innate suspicion of anything that smacks of legalism or creedalism all combine to make us especially adept for the challenge of the next century
7620453 the larger baptist voice in america has sold out to one political perspective for 30 pieces of silver
7620454 the church cannot serve a socio political ideology and christ at the same time
7620455 both the left and the right seem to be fighting for a place at the center of political power and any christianity operating from that position will be a controlling legalistic and spiritually oppressive force unable to distinguish the voices of political allies from gods voice
7620456 that is the very kind of institution that will wither under the weight of globalization it is therefore imperative that we remain distinctively baptist because we have the right recipe to be a prophetic voice speaking from the margins in a shrinking and dynamically changing world
7620457 we must preserve a distinctively baptist witness in texas and the world because the poor are depending on it
7620458 the poor are depending on our witness in the face of the strongholds of systemic evil in our state and nation
7620459 we have a shared tradition in common with all christians and we should glory in that
7620460 its essential that we teach baptist identity because theyre not getting it in their churches
7620461 some of the candidates you interview will look you in the eye and lie to you
7620462 does not have the leadership ability to be your pastor
7620463 pastors leave an educated laity who wont think of calling a fundamentalist pastor
7620464 dont let your legacy be destroyed because youre afraid of a little controversy
7620465 it used to be that be that the name baptist was enough of a network in itself
7620466 and we are planning a special surprise dinner for him for fathers day
7620467 he brings the children clothes food and lots of other things on mothers day he surprised the mothers who work here by taking them all out for dinner we were so impressed
7620468 especially with the aids epidemic there a lot of children have been left parentless someone told me this was the biggest orphanage in accra so i went
7620469 the first time i went back i took a small bag of goodies with me
7620470 that became one suitcase then more and more as the people i worked with gave me more things to take
7620471 antonios enthusiasm was contagious he made us want to help his cause
7620472 why not make a difference in the lives of some children who are not fortunate
7620473 the people at the orphanage had to be certain i wasnt a crazy person or a person trying to do something wrong to the children
7620474 a lot of us did not know the place before
7620475 even the word pizza some of us did not know
7620476 when i sit with them at dinner i feel so proud
7620477 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time

7620483 ac al intendente lo aplauden eso es lo que tiene la democracia donde lo aplauden lo votan
7620484 es muy dif cil los problemas son infinitamente menos graves que sus efectos la sensaci n que uno tiene cuando uno ve la ferocidad el odio la violencia del enfrentamiento es de estupor porque ciertamente no es un problema tan grave no sucede en un pa s colapsado sino en uno en crecimiento de manera que me llama much simo la atenci n el car cter feroz del enfrentamiento hemos tenido los argentinos problemas much simo m s graves que se resolvieron con mayor facilidad
7620485 un accidente en estados unidos o en europa es una fatalidad y aqu en vez de atender primero al accidentado buscamos los culpables coincido con alejandro que la situaci n de tensi n en obvia alusi n al conflicto con el campo nadie crey que cuando empez esto en el mes de marzo nos iba a tener en vilo a todos los argentinos en estos momentos
7620486 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7620487 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7620488 whether or not our next president and congress dismantle empire usa plus turning things around here at home
7620489 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7620490 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7620491 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
7620492 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7620493 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7620494 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t

7620500 en los dos primeros sets tuve alguna oportunidad de hacer break pero en el tercero no tuve ninguna me desgast mucho en las dos primeras mangas y luego levantar dos sets se me hac a muy dif cil mentalmente y abandon antes de lo que deb a
7620501 me quedo de este partido con el buen juego de los dos primeros sets con buenos peloteos golpes ganadoras y algunas subidas a la red
7620502 las cosas est n muy adelantadas en el transcurso del d a vamos a definir algunos temas que nos faltan por cerrar algunas cosas que quedan pendientes y seguramente lo m s r pido que podamos viajar a colombia
7620503 desde el principio de a o tuvimos contactos con las directivas del c cuta para dirigir al equipo pero por distintas razones no se pudo concretar nada despu s fue nombrado pedro sarmiento a quien aprecio mucho y por respeto a la profesi n y a l me desvincul del tema pero ahora con su salida entramos en contacto y tenemos un preacuerdo que seguramente concretaremos hoy
7620504 solo tengo muy buenos amigos en colombia as que regresar ser a como volver un poco a la casa de uno donde siempre se es bien recibido
7620505 tengo una carrera bastante amplia gracias a aquellos que confiaron en m y me dieron la posibilidad de poder trabajar
7620506 se de la brillante labor que hizo recientemente el estratega jorge luis pinto lo llev a una copa libertadores s lo que es el c cuta s de la importancia que tiene y de sus buenos jugadores
7620507 ahora quiero aprovechar esta linda oportunidad que me brinda colombia en donde espero hacer un trabajo integral como corresponde pensando en las bases en las divisiones inferiores pues la idea es tener un equipo que sea protagonista
7620508 estamos aqu porque a n no estamos clasificados para la liga de campeones de lo contrario no estar amos en polonia sino en barcelona entren ndonos
7620509 nos jugamos el a o en esta partido as que estar muy atento al comportamiento de mis jugadores en el encuentro de ma ana porque no es para tom rselo a la ligera
7620510 sigo pensando lo mismo que pensaba de ellos antes de la ida es un equipo que sabe a lo que juega tiene muy buenos jugadores sobre todo en la parcela defensiva y cosas muy interesantes los campeones de cualquier liga siempre me merecen mucho respeto

7620514 as ive traveled throughout texas this month i continue to hear from texas families and seniors about the challenges of affording health care and being able to access the kind of specialized care they need the number of uninsured individuals in texas is unacceptably high and our nations health care system is in serious need of broad reforms
7620515 unfortunately like many other pressing issues health care reform has taken a back seat to partisan games in congress
7620516 i strongly believe our first step should be strengthening and preserving the patient physician relationship
7620517 we should allow small business owners to pool their buying power and gain the same access to insurance rates that larger businesses enjoy
7620518 health care is a tough issue that requires all hands on deck working for the long term interests of patients and providers we need to make sure all texans have access to top notch health care facilities like the texas spine amp joint hospital
7620519 is this really happening will i have to make an announcement reminding everyone that the fists on the 06 and 07 rt posters should be interpreted metaphorically
7620520 performed at or above proficiency in reading as opposed to 67 7 of conventional public school students
7620521 there is no need to set up new threats to schools for not performing
7620522 despite desperate efforts to make the voucher debate about school choice and improving opportunities for low income students vouchers remain an elitist strategy
7620523 if there was any argument for vouchers it was lets see if the experiment works and if it does whatever my preconception you do what is best for the kids
7620524 that throughout his career he has voted against voucher proposals
7620525 public education should be defined as one in which our public support for a childs education follows that child into the school the parent chooses
7620526 school choice for all who want it and expansion of opportunity scholarships will all be a part of a serious agenda of education reform
7620527 i think the option we would have if we were not given the six months there is a really high likelihood that we would no bid the program
7620528 this is an airplane thats going to be in the inventory 40 years
7620529 what were asking for is an additional four months to have a meaningful competition
7620530 i would rather not turn in a losing proposal than turn in one thats not competitive
7620531 wanna be on national tv it helps if youre from westchester just ask kara dioguardi and bobby moynihan

7620539 cambio todos mis triunfos de la radio por un empate en el amor
7620540 que son cosas que pasan dos o tres veces en
7620541 el triunfo de la radio est bien pero no lo vivo con tanta intensidad como un amor exitoso que son cosas que pasan dos o tres veces en la vida
7620542 por qu no puede ser intenso digno un amor de siete dias
7620543 en contra de los amores de ocho meses porque es una duraci n m sera para ser un fuego artifical es demasiado largo y para tener pretenciones de perpetuidad es muy corto
7620544 ahora que existe la posibilidad de que alg n amor sea el ltimo y de no ser elegido valoro cada segundo que soy elegido
7620545 we do realize that there will be more failures but its something that we can manage
7620546 we have a pretty significant fund and we have the ability to replenish it
7620547 for a lot of banks the die has already been cast
7620548 the banking industry goes into this mess much stronger than it was
7620549 as the fdic incurs losses those losses will be passed back to the banking industry
7620550 we had one of the largest and certainly what we think will be one of the most expensive failures at the beginning of the cycle
7620551 although its going to be challenging its not going to be all that bad
7620552 if anyone has a deposit of less than 100 000 they can sleep as soundly as always
7620553 i was shocked that the fdic did not have indymac on its watch list until a month before
7620554 you may have an inexperienced team remember for the last 13 or 14 years the banking industry has been pretty benign
7620555 they knew their funds were insured they still lined up and took their money out
7620556 weve had three failures since indymac and they all went smoothly
7620557 i feel that we did recognize it and did what we could
7620558 mom can we do this next year i mean i know youre not a fan of camping but its been so much fun

7620560 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7620561 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7620562 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7620563 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7620564 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7620565 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7620566 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7620567 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7620568 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7620569 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7620570 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7620571 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7620572 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7620573 how do you feel about astilbe delphinium monks hood monarda
7620574 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7620575 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7620576 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list

7620594 i am from illinois and am leaning toward obama but what has he done for my state spent all of his time running for president
7620595 should we elect the most inexperienced presidential candidate of our times or was she right
7620596 mischa and taylor were at a table on the patio with several friends
7620597 she was chain smoking and enjoying a glass of white wine which over the course of two hours was followed by at least five more her speech became more slurred with each drink and her head began falling onto taylors chest
7620598 at one point she tried to move from her chair to a nearby couch but stumbled headfirst into the couch taylor was mortified he snapped at her mischa come on youre making a fool of yourself people can see how drunk you are he demanded that she stop drinking but she only mumbled incoherently

7620654 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7620655 launching the h3t is valuable to us whether we opt to keep the brand or not
7620656 communicat ing to the prospective purchaser that weve got a pickup truck
7620657 girls who smoke and read fanny hill while i was reading dtocqueville
7620658 they have this really wacky call like a crazy chicken crossed with a pigeon
7620659 if you get bored here then you dont know how to unwind
7620660 as long as the sex is good everything else will fall into place
7620661 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7620662 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7620663 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7620664 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7620665 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7620666 simultaneously with the guidelines changes the administration is stealthily unfurling a gamut of other regulatory changes to shift federal and local law enforcement dramatically from an investigative to an intelligence gathering role
7620667 how can any progressive look themselves in the mirror after the election if mccain wins and they have not devoted at least some time to the obama campaign
7620668 i promise to appoint more justices to the supreme court like roberts
7620669 when i was a child i thought as a child but when i grew up i put away childish things

7620678 open and frequent communication between parents and school staff is a key ingredient to keeping food allergic students out of harm it takes a partnership to establish effective avoidance strategies and emergency plans
7620679 parents should be aware of expiration dates and keep in contact with their allergist to insure that all medication especially self injectable epinephrine is replaced prior to expiration
7620680 the dogs were yelping and pawing at themselves and biting at themselves
7620681 nice piece 5 yrs old belongs to my gf and she wants to sell it
7620682 my client was contacted by the fbi at her job and was told a little bit about what her husbands activities were
7620683 she was completely blindsided she had no idea of the double life this man was leading
7620684 op die manier krijgen we snel een groot gebied boven peking helder
7620685 el baloncesto espa ol est arriba arriba no s lo porque sea plata ol mpica ni campeona del mundo y subcampeona de europa sino porque en todos los torneos internacionales desde hace muchos a os est arriba
7620686 hay alguna selecci n que consigue un gran xito en un momento determinado pero luego desaparece pero espa a siempre est ah
7620687 ha sido un partido muy bonito primero llegar a una final ol mpica es muy dif cil y luego jugar con estados unidos que es un estados unidos mucho mejor que anteriores campeonatos con posibilidades es para sentirse orgulloso
7620688 solamente cosas de tipo t cnico alguna vez presionar amos todo el campo y no todas las veces porque la no hab a tanta desventaja como para presionar siempre
7620689 si hubi semos metido un triple que se ha ido por poco hubi semos visto que hubiese pasado
7620690 la verdad que era una posibilidad ya hab amos hablado por una parte que no hab a que hacerse demasiadas ilusiones porque si te haces muchas ilusiones de ganar y no puedes igual te vienes abajo
7620691 ten amos estudiadas las dos posibilidades tambi n la de irse abajo y en un momento determinado salir adelante porque para eso ten amos el ejemplo de argentina que el d a anterior que el primer cuarto perd a por mucho y luego remontaron a nosotros nos sali mucho mejor
7620692 lo primero fue solidarizarse con l y en segundo lugar recuperar los jugadores que hab an roto su ritmo de preparaci n al final de la fase preparatoria en espa a por unas peque as lesiones ra l l pez que fue b sico en la semifinal y juan carlos navarro en la final
7620693 jose era el jugador m s f sico que tenemos para jugar con una selecci n como la de estados unidos igual estoy satisfecho por la puntuaci n de todos los dem s
7620694 es un nime no s lo desde espa a sino de todo el mundo que es un caso excepcional y ha jugado unos juegos fenomenales
7620695 si est s hablando de eso quitas lo que realmente es un xito est s llorando porque no nos han pitado los pasos y realmente creo que tenemos que estar sonriendo porque hemos unos juegos ol mpicos magn ficos
7620696 eso no lo sabemos porque la historia va cambiando a cada momento y vamos a ver como llegan los jugadores para la pr xima ocasi n
7620697 la verdad que es dif cil entrenar a la selecci n en s misma no por el hecho de sustituir a pepu porque ese reto lo ten a totalmente asumido porque lo bien que lo hab a hecho en la selecci n estaba ah y si no lo hac amos bien ahora me iban a caer encima
7620698 siempre es dif cil llevar la selecci n pero tambi n es relativamente f cil porque hay mucho talento
7620699 we put the bodies in the main mosque he told the associated press by phone sometimes pausing to collect himself as he wept
7620700 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7620701 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7620702 it is a long term call on the common stock
7620703 without such a plan like this shareholders might get zero you want zero or ongoing companies
7620704 common holders will face dilution but it would be down the road with this plan
7620705 the equity is virtually worthless and will continue to be
7620706 if the treasury buys preferred stock though i would assume that would validate that class of equity during any liquidation reprivitization
7620707 the election season and the relatively recent passage of the treasury authorization argue for delay as long as possible
7620708 das kann ja dann nicht so schwer gewesen sein sonst w rst du ja noch nicht fertig was hast du noch studiert
7620709 siehste germanistik das ist doch humbug da muss man ja auch nichts k nnen bwl hingegen das muss man verstehen wei t du da braucht man grips da kann man nicht nur ein buch lesen und sagen jaaa sch n das gef llt mir in bwl muss man richtig was k nnen
7620710 ich suche im moment nach einer stelle die mir zusagt
7620711 were probably going to lose somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 billion this year
7620712 if we dont act well lose 2 billion or more the following year
7620713 i believe very strongly that our rural communities are a whole lot more than a 5 digit or 9 digit zip code
7620714 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7620715 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7620716 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7620717 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7620718 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7620719 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7620720 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7620721 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7620722 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7620723 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7620724 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7620725 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7620726 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7620727 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7620728 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7620729 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7620730 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7620731 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so
7620732 britney spears will not be performing at the vmas this year im telling you officially and unequivocally
7620733 the cost of obtaining a u s degree is among the highest in the world and rising which may discourage international students
7620734 okay youre back in but only now that the primaries are over and cant pick up any momentum from them plus weve artificially skewed the results
7620735 modern science has advanced since and this is an opportunity to apply modern science to evaluate these products
7620736 this is the beginning of getting drugs that are widely used in children in the over the counter world using the same modern approach weve started using for prescription drugs
7620737 thats the booker prize for you a grand folly on the horizon of each literary year
7620738 after forty years making the headlines in the literary world it is good that the man booker prize is now also taking a lead in the world of new technology
7620739 thats the booker prize for you a grand folly on the horizon of each literary year
7620740 were very happy to be working with comic and anime stores around new york city to offer fans another way to purchase tickets to the 2008 new york anime festival
7620741 weve been working with some stores for years now and this is the first time were partnering with many more were always excited to make local shops part of the new york anime festival family

7620743 consideramos asegura arranz que tuvo que abandonar el coche con toda la documentaci n y objetos personales porque tuvo que cambiar de planes para llevar a cabo el presunto asesinato
7620744 puesto que creemos que volvi de letonia con la intenci n de encontrar a su ex pareja en el momento del hecho iba disfrazado adem s de que hab a alquilado un coche a un particular que luego tuvo que dejar abandonado

7620746 fashion is always something thats fun for me in the near future ill be designing my own clothes as well so im looking forward to that
7620747 since august 2007 the euraud has traded in a tightening range but with a bullish bias the higher lows since 1 5491 and the multiple tests of resistance just shy of 1 75 favor a bullish break now is the time to position for a break through 1 75
7620748 islandia que no era favorito se ha llevado la plata y todos los dem s alemania dinamarca rusia se han quedado fuera en las primeras de cambio
7620749 yo soy autocr tico y cuando no hicimos las cosas bien yo lo dije desde el principio
7620750 en cambio este ltimo partido creo que ha sido el que mejor se ha jugado desde t nez incluso mejor
7620751 al final hemos levantado el tema defensivo y estamos muy contentos con el bronce en la mano hemos ganado a la campeona ol mpica de seis y con un sabor de boca muy bueno porque este bronce nos ha sabido a oro estoy incre blemente contento
7620752 ramos uno de los mejores equipos lo que pasa es que cuando las cosas no salen no salen pero f sicamente si ahora tenemos que jugar otros tres partidos para luchar por el oro ahora mismo los juego
7620753 estuvimos muy cerca llevarnos el t tulo ante un equipo que jugaron a un grand simo nivel durante todo el campeonato y estamos satisfechos de la entrega del resultado y de las situaciones
7620754 hemos sufrido con el equipo para llegar hasta ah y al final hemos podido tener un resultado muy positivo y acabar con muy buenas sensaciones
7620755 por fin ya que las necesito como el aire que respiro
7620756 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7620757 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7620758 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7620759 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7620760 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7620761 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7620762 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7620763 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7620764 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7620765 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7620766 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7620767 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7620768 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7620769 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7620770 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7620771 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7620772 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7620773 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7620774 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7620775 ive given much thought and prayer to this issue let me first say that i prefer the original hebrew and greek however i also realize that the common man cannot read those languages therefore the issue is which of the english translations best renders the meaning of the originals
7620776 although i have preferred other translations in the past my current favorite is the new living translation in fact from this day forward i will hold an nlt only position
7620777 my reasoning after much prayer and fasting is that the nlt has come from a thought for thought or idea for idea philosophy of translation this stands in opposition to the word for word translations such as the kjv nkjv nasb esv hcsb etc because the nlt uses a thought for thought approach this translation cannot be as exact as some of the others this allows me to claim to like the bible while still holding to blatantly unbiblical positions such as supporting partial birth abortions and same sex unions
7620778 my faith is very important to me i have faith in god thats why i carry the nlt i also have faith in acceptance tolerance and diversity thats also why i carry the nlt with this loose translation as my guide along with several trans gendered communists i will lead this country to places it has never been
7620779 with this translation and fred phelps at my side we will smiteth our enemies and rid the land of noisome pestilences
7620780 u s recession and recovery u v or w shaped
7620781 theres been debate about whether its v shaped or u shaped
7620782 trying to make a desperate situation look sort of technical its not that much of a fuss the big boys can take care of it dont you worry
7620783 except the big boys here their trousers are getting a little short im afraid
7620784 this could extend itself well into 2009 with repercussions that could keep the country stagnant for two or three years
7620785 were not expecting this to be a hockey stick in the true sense of a hockey stick of a year at all
7620786 were closer to the end than we are to the beginning
7620787 the great recession game of 08 what inning are we in
7620788 the future of the hive does not depend on full employment for all the worker bees
7620789 in fact an accident can put many bees out of action without compromising the hive as a whole
7620790 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7620791 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7620792 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7620793 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7620794 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7620795 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7620796 the removal of legal and social sanctions against homosexuality has positive ramifications that go beyond concerns of public health and which strengthen the foundations of a democratic polity
7620797 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7620798 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7620799 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7620800 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7620801 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7620802 the treasury is most concerned with supporting the 7 56 billion of fannie freddie debt and mortgage guarantees outstanding so its reasonable to assume that debt and mortgages remain secure
7620803 while were fairly confident that senior obligations will be supported by any government rescue what happens after that particularly with regard to the 16 billion of subordinated debt and 36 billion of preferreds is open to a great deal of uncertainty
7620804 with the stock and preferred performing so poorly and the debt hanging in there thats a market indication that the consensus is that theres going to be some sort of takeover
7620805 pe o desculpa aos adeptos do aek mas era imposs vel recusar esta proposta na fase final da minha carreira
7620806 ele um atleta que d alegria sheva um grand ssimo jogador e espero poder ajud lo como espero poder ajudar todos do milan

7620811 om godt to uger skal m ndene atter dyste om h ndboldguldet men turneringen skifter navn fra tele2 ligaen til cbb mobil ligaen
7620812 vi kunne godt t nke os at v re lidt mere kendte og der synes vi faktisk at herreh ndbold har s bred en opbakning i den danske befolkning at det vil vi gerne lukrere en lille smule p
7620813 vi har set historisk at det giver en st rre loyalitet hvis vi rammer folk p deres f lelser som der selvf lgelig ligger i den lokale klub
7620814 vi vil kaste os fuldt ind i det her og give det s meget vi kan s b de vi og klubberne f r s meget ud af det som muligt hvis begge parter kan se at det faktisk giver en merv rdi jamen s vil vi overveje ud fra et forretningsm ssigt synspunkt om vi skal forl nge med to r mere
7620815 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7620816 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7620817 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7620818 go through a number of levers in the iraqi political system before we actually have an agreement from the iraqi side
7620819 until we have a deal we dont have a deal
7620820 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7620821 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7620822 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7620823 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7620824 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7620825 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7620826 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7620827 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7620828 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7620829 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7620830 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7620831 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7620832 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7620833 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7620834 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7620835 whenever i appear before immigrant audiences i can count on some good natured ribbing from my staff after my speech according to them my remarks always follow a three part structure

7620868 these abnormal features of tumor vessels impair delivery of circulating chemotherapeutic drugs to the actual tumor site
7620869 because high cell density increases contractility across the entire cell layer these findings suggested that tumor capillary cells are inherently hyper contractile
7620870 in this study weve uncovered a previously unrecognized role for tumor capillary cell mechanosensing and contractility in the formation of irregular tumor vessels and have identified potential new targets for vascular normalization therapy that might be implemented in the clinic someday
7620871 a vote for obama is a vote for dead children
7620872 a vote for mccain is a vote for dead soldiers
7620873 giving america back to the working people who built it

7620882 i think they should congratulate him and leave him alone
7620883 it adds quite a bit of personal interest to the race even my father has gotten excited about this when he saw joe jog up to the stage on saturday and its not easy to get my father excited
7620884 if i thought about it a little more i might considering that we might have our best delawarean in office
7620885 its extremely cool to have someone from your hometown going up for that position but i wouldnt let that sway my decision i would still base it on the issues
7620886 i think senator biden gives also that balance to say look i have a person on my team that knows how to get things done so i think its going to help instill the type of confidence necessary to win in november
7620887 changed our minds about what were going to do about voting now because we love joe
7620888 the selection of senator biden is smart and strategic he is extremely capable on matters of foreign policy and international affairs and his ability to frame the complex issues facing america in simple terms is a gift as importantly he will be helpful to the campaigns effort to win the adjacent states of pennsylvania and new jersey i was privileged to work with him in his first presidential campaign and am confident that senator obamas decision to choose him as his running mate will produce the kind of change our nation so desperately needs
7620889 today is a great day for democrats we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president this campaign is going to make history not only will we put barack obama and his running mate joe biden into the white house but were going to elect a filibuster proof senate majority that can and will pass the democratic agenda this is the once in a generation chance weve been waiting for our party has never been more energized or more dedicated across the country we have set records for voter registration and primary participation in just a matter of hours well gather in denver for a democratic convention that will demonstrate our amazing and growing strength for the final stretch before election day barack obama and joe biden are on a path to bring sweeping change to this great country each and every committed democrat stands proudly with them today and right on through election day together we will take back the white house and elect the filibuster proof senate majority we need to bring that change
7620890 i want to congratulate senator obama on his selection of senator biden as his vice presidential nominee in addition to the tremendous foreign policy credentials that senator biden brings to the democratic ticket he also has a deep knowledge of the issues important to families in maryland and the delmarva peninsula in maryland senator biden will be a critical ally and partner working with senator obama the next president of the united states as we work to restore the health of the chesapeake bay and expand opportunity for our families senator biden is a friend and colleague and i look forward to working with him in the months and years ahead to move our state and our nation forward

7620958 we would buy preferred stock subject to significant treasury participation and an attractive yield
7620959 it is a long term call on the common stock
7620960 without such a plan like this shareholders might get zero you want zero or ongoing companies
7620961 common holders will face dilution but it would be down the road with this plan
7620962 the equity is virtually worthless and will continue to be
7620963 if the treasury buys preferred stock though i would assume that would validate that class of equity during any liquidation reprivitization
7620964 the election season and the relatively recent passage of the treasury authorization argue for delay as long as possible
7620965 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes
7620966 if fannie and freddie fail it would be a tremendous body blow to the economy you probably could not get a mortgage out there they are too central to the housing market
7620967 debt collection can be a stressful terrifying experience know your rights to protect yourself
7620968 i think what barak obama and running mate joe biden have to do at this convention is to do what the campaign for change has been been doing for lo these many months which is to remind people what a difficult situation the united states of america is in not only domestically but internationally
7620969 everybodys looking to have a good time as long as people keep it under control and safe its usually great
7620970 its a concern because thats where we deal the most with the major injuries alcohol related injuries and crimes when people are highly intoxicated

7620981 thats my friend abubakr hes from the african tama tribe
7620982 there are problems in darfur but they are not between people they are related to the government and to politics
7620983 no single tribe in sudan can claim it is purely african or arab
7620984 the government made use of the conflict in darfur in a kind of non thoughtful way
7620985 it was not sensitive to the tribal relationships the tribal history of the area and the resources
7620986 the disputes between the arabs and people in darfur originate from different reasons grazing pastures natural things they are not rooted in race
7620987 the arabs that are here have nothing to do with this
7620988 who supported them who gave them the guns wasnt it the government
7620989 i can interact with arabs at work or in general ways but when it comes to close relationships i feel there is a wall between us
7620990 we were still looking for dichotomy of some kind something that would explain what was going on easily and simply we latched onto the arab african dichotomy which did vast damage then as the conflict developed it became a reality on the ground it became something by which people explained the conflict themselves
7620991 i would love to stay home with my boys liam 3 and aidan 1 but i really have to work
7620992 the higher cost of living is having an impact on peoples lives

7620995 we know of three children aged 16 14 and eight who spend a couple of hours at home by themselves every day the parents have to do it because they are at work
7620996 the rate rises are not an issue for us luckily but petrol prices with two cars are
7620997 my husband drives more than i do and he uses the toll roads and they do add up
7620998 the trains are always on time but they are going to increase in price too and i dont think thats worth it
7620999 they are very busy and overcrowded especially in peak hour

7621025 when we started as guerillas we walked from sudan to ethiopia carrying food and ammunition on our heads
7621026 now with the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement the spla has been transformed into a conventional army there is a tremendous change
7621027 during the war we were thinking of fighting now we are thinking of human resource development
7621028 this is what we have been dreaming of it was difficult it was hard but we are on that track
7621029 there are repeated reports of a lack of discipline by certain members of the spla
7621030 this is well known within the spla and senior leadership as well and something they would like to bring better under control
7621031 they need to move away from a situation where some people fear either the police or the army
7621032 in the west they say rome was not built in one day
7621033 for 21 years the spla has been a guerilla army you cant expect it to change in six years
7621034 that alone to be achieved within three years is really incredible
7621035 we want to win the election of 2009 as sudanese and capture power in khartoum through elections

7621038 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7621039 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7621040 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7621041 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate

7621046 obamas stadium address on thursday the 45th anniversary of rev martin luther king jr s i have a dream speech will result in effusive and overwhelming press coverage this coverage will be impenetrable and will undoubtedly impact the polls
7621047 the one returns this time to lead us to the road to denver
7621048 we will encourage voters to look beyond the glamour of barack obamas celebrity status to his inexperience and lack of accomplishment
7621049 even democrats in ohio are calling on senator obama to offer something more than a lofty speech ohioans are beginning to wonder if theres anything more to barack obama than his trusty teleprompter
7621050 i think that within 10 years this type of interactive targeting of potential partners could well be influencing migration flows even if only at the margins

7621180 therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear is not life more important than food and the body more important than clothes look at the birds of the air they do not sow or reap or store away in barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not much more valuable than they who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life and why do you worry about clothes see how the lilies of the field grow they do not labor or spin yet i tell you that not even solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these if that is how god clothes the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire will he not much more clothe you o you of little faith so do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear for the pagans run after all these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own
7621181 its no big deal dad hes probably more likely to get killed in a car accident by one of the crazy drivers here than something happen while hes in india
7621182 yeah well something could have happened when we all flitted off to grand cayman last year too are you saying none of us should go anywhere anymore because of the dangers or does it only apply to mission trips
7621183 do you guys think you are helping me do you think i dont worry enough on my own without you adding to my burden im not stupid i know the dangers of my husband going to a foreign place or my kid being left alone in the bathtub or insert any other worry inducing situation i know what could happen to him for trying to bring the gospel to a hostile area i need you guys to be supportive for me i know it doesnt make sense to you i understand you are concerned and i appreciate that but i am not the person to tell these concerns to you are my parents you have always been there for me and you have always been strong for me i need you to be like that still dont tell me what we do is a mistake its our choice if you feel you cant be supportive then please dont say anything at all
7621184 on monday morning the republican candidate got some new gasolina when he appeared with reggaeton star daddy yankee at central high school in phoenix arizona
7621185 the choice of central high school whose students are three quarters latino in a state where immigration has been an especially contentious issue seemed clearly calculated to boost mccains profile in a population that could be key in several battleground states
7621186 hes been a fighter for the hispanic community hes been a fighter for the immigration issue
7621187 is it hypocritical for obama to use a gesture from a rap star whose lyrics are so street they cant be reproduced in a blog meant for a general audience whose lyrics amount to the type obama has criticized in the past as demeaning to african americans and women
7621188 indeed the dirt off your shoulder lyrics repeatedly include the n word
7621189 embrace is a mixed blessing politically anyway for the candidate as the media firestorm over ludacris mixtape freestyle about obama showed dramatically ludas lyrical jabs at hillary clinton john mccain and george bush were vilified by some media outlets leading obamas camp to issue a statement saying luda should be ashamed of his words
7621190 rappers need to be quiet super quiet on barack all it takes is for a mutha er getting out there being real ghetto and people will be like we dont wanna f with obama theyll wanna smash on him because of what somebody else said someone speaks for himself and its baracks fault what did luda say thats baracks fault is it baracks fault what im saying i dont wanna be the reason he dont get the presidency
7621191 points up the dilemma facing the nations potential first black president who wants the support of the influential hip hop community but needs to steer clear of the controversy so commonly associated with its music
7621192 although the media has finally exposed barack obamas ties to the unhinged pastor his support from rappers who propagate equally pernicious nonsense has gone almost entirely unnoticed
7621193 have any rappers donated to his campaign will he return the money why has he not renounced support from rappers is this going to take 20 years like it did with reverend wright
7621194 having a thug like ludacris anywhere near your campaign is not a good thing and obama knows it
7621195 in reality i dont worry about that cause im really sure that all of those rappers that diss me aint gangsters laughs you understand i dont worry about none of them cause i know none of them are gangsters and none of them are gonna do anything to me cause they know im a boss
7621196 that may not seem impressive compared to package titles that sell in the millions but compared to other digital titles that is a friggin juggernaut
7621197 and while its great to have my first title be not only a critically acclaimed one but also a financial success there is a bigger picture at play here that we need to look at consumers voted with their dollars they basically have sent the message loud and clear

7621220 legislation is working its way through the state capitol that would allow cities with voter approval to levy higher car registration fees and gas taxes
7621221 the bill would allow regional transportation agencies to increase vehicle license fees up to 90 depending on the fuel efficiency of the vehicle agencies would also be allowed to propose a 3 percent increase to a gallon of gasoline
7621222 local streets and roads the state highway system sidewalks or bicycle routes
7621223 any increase proposal would have to go to the voters in a regular election but because the increases are considered fees a simple majority would be needed to pass an initiative rather than the two thirds majority needed to pass a new tax

7621294 while this billboard itself wasnt sexualising children it was placing sex before them
7621295 given what was happening in the community and the senate inquiry into the sexualisation of children in the media we considered that there had been a definite shift in community standards
7621296 there will always be certain hot points within the community that are of concern
7621297 the boards role is to walk the line between advertisers being able to advertise their product and the community not being offended
7621298 now its been brought to a head and we have to find a new message
7621299 every single person in el paso i dont feel is going for barack obama i am going to register for the vote someone to replace them the rest of this pettiness let them wallow in it because i am moving on my gut reaction is that a good democrat will do what good democrats will have to do in the very end i am going to give them some credit
7621300 regardless of what he does or what he says they republican are going to try to use it against him
7621301 regardless of why he picked him had to pick someone he felt comfortable and meets all the criteria he mentioned joe biden fits what he was looking for its a team so he should be given credit for making a wise choice
7621302 every single person in el paso i dont feel is going for barack obama i am going to register for the vote someone to replace them the rest of this pettiness let them wallow in it because i am moving on
7621303 i cant wait to hear hillary clinton talk about the future and am excited that her candidacy is unifying our party
7621304 the obama campaign is leaving little to chance it has created a rapid response team led by craig smith a former top operative in the clinton world to head out to the convention floor at the first sign of any trouble from clinton supporters
7621305 i cant wait to hear hillary clinton talk about the future and am excited that her candidacy is unifying our party
7621306 when i support somebody i support them no mickey mouse stuff
7621307 texas and the southwest are deeply indebted to clinton because of the great work he did for mexican americans i dont think obama knows anything about mexican americans
7621308 never in the political process did he obama mention cesar chavez or the plight of farmworkers
7621309 appointments to mexican americans will diminish our education rates are low and theyre going to use that excuse and go after appointments from illinois or detroit
7621310 im going to vote straight democrat what im saying now is not meant to poison im just just telling you facts and truths that will not be erased easily
7621311 norma i never liked her its known i cannot stand norma and she cannot stand me
7621312 one senior obama supporter said the clinton associates negotiating on her behalf act like japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7621313 historians of party conventions point out that their two primary purposes are to set a course for the general election and to demonstrate party unity to the nation
7621314 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7621315 and he has not demonstrated that he accepts the clintons and the clinton wing of the party
7621316 forty two percent of mrs clintons pledged delegates surveyed say they would vote for her but 43 percent say they would vote for mr obama while another 15 percent have not decided what they will do when mrs clintons name is put into nomination the poll of 970 democratic delegates selected at random of the 4 439 total delegates was conducted july 16 aug 17 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points
7621317 ive always been a big hillary supporter but for party unity id have no problem going with obama
7621318 i got over that real quick i mean what can you do i looked at the other choices and thought biden would be excellent
7621319 thats what i dont understand i have to wait and see what she says shes been supporting obama all this time after she conceded why didnt she release us
7621320 regardless of what he does or what he says they republican are going to try to use it against him
7621321 regardless of why he picked him had to pick someone he felt comfortable and meets all the criteria he mentioned joe biden fits what he was looking for its a team so he should be given credit for making a wise choice
7621322 every single person in el paso i dont feel is going for barack obama i am going to register for the vote someone to replace them the rest of this pettiness let them wallow in it because i am moving on
7621323 my gut reaction is that a good democrat will do what good democrats will have to do in the very end i am going to give them some credit
7621324 the obama campaign is leaving little to chance it has created a rapid response team led by craig smith a former top operative in the clinton world to head out to the convention floor at the first sign of any trouble from clinton supporters
7621325 i cant wait to hear hillary clinton talk about the future and am excited that her candidacy is unifying our party
7621326 when i support somebody i support them no mickey mouse stuff
7621327 texas and the southwest are deeply indebted to clinton because of the great work he did for mexican americans i dont think obama knows anything about mexican americans
7621328 never in the political process did he obama mention cesar chavez or the plight of farmworkers
7621329 appointments to mexican americans will diminish our education rates are low and theyre going to use that excuse and go after appointments from illinois or detroit
7621330 im going to vote straight democrat what im saying now is not meant to poison im just just telling you facts and truths that will not be erased easily
7621331 norma i never liked her its known i cannot stand norma and she cannot stand me
7621332 i cant count too well but i know the millions of votes she got can be very helpful to the democratic party or very detrimental
7621333 im a puma but that doesnt mean anything because pumas might not be around after the convention
7621334 we agree and disagree thats what democrats are about at the end we might come together we might not when you get behind the curtain you can vote for president or skip that race
7621335 but what has obama done has he even proven hes an american citizen no
7621336 a mexican american would have been crucified if he could not provide his birth certificate
7621337 have the blacks ever stood up on our behalf on immigration for example yet we always vote to support them
7621338 dont get me wrong i have very good friends who are black theyre different from the black political leadership
7621339 historians of party conventions point out that their two primary purposes are to set a course for the general election and to demonstrate party unity to the nation
7621340 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7621341 and he has not demonstrated that he accepts the clintons and the clinton wing of the party
7621342 forty two percent of mrs clintons pledged delegates surveyed say they would vote for her but 43 percent say they would vote for mr obama while another 15 percent have not decided what they will do when mrs clintons name is put into nomination the poll of 970 democratic delegates selected at random of the 4 439 total delegates was conducted july 16 aug 17 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points
7621343 ive always been a big hillary supporter but for party unity id have no problem going with obama
7621344 i got over that real quick i mean what can you do i looked at the other choices and thought biden would be excellent
7621345 thats what i dont understand i have to wait and see what she says shes been supporting obama all this time after she conceded why didnt she release us
7621346 youre seeing people who are for obama who are for hillary people arent speaking im not going to have any of that wednesday will be when we all make our final decision some of us will support sen obama i have always voted democrat not always straight ticket but i will not cross over to the republican side
7621347 mr obama likes to say hes skinny but tough but with all due respect he hasnt yet demonstrated the degree of toughness needed to prevail in a presidential campaign there is nothing genteel about these contests
7621348 maybe you consider yourself a radical maybe a democrat maybe youll vote for obama or maybe you think the whole system is corrupt and maybe you think obama can end the war and maybe he can one thing is certain though the war wont end without all of us demanding and forcing it it doesnt matter what ideologies are held if some of us are planning to vote for obama or vote no to the entire system were coming together in denver this august to tell sen obama and the democratic party that if they dont end the war we will

7621363 i didnt say that but im very disappointed that you would come out and interview us and ask for confirmation and we said we would not confirm
7621364 an equity investment from a top tier venture capital firm
7621365 i have been a resident of santa clarita for five years and i am honored to be involved with the santa clarita valley youth project
7621366 its an honor to be able to lend support to a group that works hard to help our youth and our community
7621367 we are thrilled to have the addition of tony potts to our fundraising event
7621368 we expect this event will once again be a sell out at the tpc and are confident that our guests will enjoy a night of fun that will hopefully mean big money for the youth project
7621369 jaipur police had come to lucknow today they took the help of ats and they had the production warrant for a person called shahbaaz the warrant was from thana manik chowk
7621370 i dont know how they can possibly reschedule it because you have to have a window of opportunity for the cricketing nations to be available at a given stage next year
7621371 we feel that our team is in dire need of exposure in foreign conditions and with this postponement we believe we can now have an offshore series
7621372 the south africans have responded well because i think most of the countries realise that pakistan cricket has suffered a big setback
7621373 professional risk assessment says the risk is acceptable in some places at the moment its not acceptable in pakistan
7621374 we are facing a critical situation when many other states have offered the tatas to shift their small car plant from singur
7621375 we are facing a critical situation when many other states have offered the tatas to shift their small car plant from singur which we cannot afford to lose

7621378 the seat sharing talks between sp and congress are making no headway there is no formal talk since you reporters are insisting i met the prime minister and soniaji the day before yesterday and i have said that it is unnecessarily delayed for long
7621379 china puede sentirse orgullosa por la organizaci n de unos juegos ol mpicos espectaculares que unieron a atletas y pueblos de todo el mundo para celebrar el esp ritu ol mpico la cooperaci n y la buena voluntad
7621380 el secretario general felicita al gobierno y el pueblo de china por un empe o sin precedentes y por el xito logrado en la organizaci n de los hist ricos juegos ol mpicos de pek n
7621381 proporcionaron una oportunidad importante para la promoci n de la paz internacional y la armon a mediante la profundizaci n del di logo y el entendimiento mutuo en la comunidad internacional
7621382 los chilenos a n no dimensionan lo que marta ha realizado en tan poco tiempo con el f tbol femenino
7621383 con absoluta sinceridad les comento que la s ntesis de la entrenadora es lo que m s he podido valorar porque es mi especialidad
7621384 y si bien estoy llevando un ciclo que se asemeja al que ella est realizando tengo la certeza de que lo que hacemos no tiene la dimensi n de lo que ella logr hacer en este tiempo por lo cual testimonio por ese trabajo
7621385 lo que he visto en el trabajo del f tbol femenino y la organizaci n del mundial me lo han ratificado
7621386 a nosotros nos gustan los grandes desaf os y que vengan muchas actividades de este nivel
7621387 es mucho nervio mucha adrenalina y ojo que cuando termina ya tenemos el sudamericano sub17 encima eso nos gusta y nos satisface trabajar por el bien del f tbol chileno
7621388 los estadios estar n listos y dejar n sin palabras a los m s pesimistas
7621389 no puedo garantizar resultados pero s que llegaremos con opci n de tener xito
7621390 nosotros nos reunimos y tomamos la decisi n sobre la salida de sarmiento porque nos cansamos de ver al equipo jugando mal algunos nos critican porque nos demoramos en tomar correctivos
7621391 estuvimos muy cerca llevarnos el t tulo ante un equipo que jugaron a un grand simo nivel durante todo el campeonato y estamos satisfechos de la entrega del resultado y de las situaciones
7621392 hemos sufrido con el equipo para llegar hasta ah y al final hemos podido tener un resultado muy positivo y acabar con muy buenas sensaciones
7621393 por fin ya que las necesito como el aire que respiro
7621394 me dese felicidades por mi actuaci n por el partido y por el resultado y que nos vemos en los ngeles
7621395 quiero agradecerles a todos los aficionados y la gente que nos sigue nos apoya y nos da todo este cari o y al final merece la pena todo

7621398 when mendis bowls a bad ball you have to punish it so that you can put pressure on him its very important to get runs out of bad balls

7621404 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7621405 so goes the dollar so goes the energy complex these days
7621406 the storm is trying to pull the market higher but its not getting much of a boost
7621407 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7621408 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7621409 in doing so this company has fallen far short of meeting the high business standards that iowans expect
7621410 there will be no industrial jungles in iowa on my watch
7621411 in the end we are certain that the governor will see firsthand that our plant is anything but a jungle and that when all the bitterness of the last few months is taken out of the equation that we are indeed on a course to being on an even higher road
7621412 i feel completely blessed and grateful about whole bakers partnership with pacmoore
7621413 im certain that whole bakers and pacmoore will ensure the highest quality gluten free baked good products around
7621414 we have been amazed at the demand growth for gluten free products but are also aware that it has been an ongoing struggle to produce gluten free items that deliver great taste whole bakers has done just that and we are excited to partner with them to help grow this extraordinary product line
7621415 even though these infringements occurred in one of our companies prior to our ownership we cooperated with the bsa to get this matter resolved and are committed to making sure the appropriate licensed software is used in all author solutions companies
7621416 bsas settlement with author solutions illustrates that even a well managed reputable company needs to be fully attentive to software licensing requirements
7621417 its necessary for businesses to purchase licenses for all software installed on their computers they need to pay as careful attention to their software management as they do to other aspects of their business the lesson can sometimes be a hard one its cheaper to purchase legal software and invest in software management than get caught by the bsa
7621418 when i contacted bsa i was simply looking to do the right thing
7621419 im just glad theres a resource for people to turn to in order to report software piracy
7621420 the united states may have the lowest pc software piracy rate in the world but still one out of every five pieces of software put into service is unlicensed
7621421 not only is this a problem for the software industry but piracy also creates major legal and security risks for the companies involved the saddest aspect is that the lost revenues to tech companies and local governments could be supporting thousands of good jobs and much needed social services in our communities
7621422 were looking forward to working alongside the iedc in representing indiana as the preferred place to grow a business
7621423 business development missions give us the chance to build stronger relationships with our colleagues at the iedc as well as with national and international consultants who assist companies with expansion and relocation decisions
7621424 my thinking is that we should actually try to do things with a social network that is we should consider the social network the model by which we do things
7621425 the dollar wants to pull oil lower and the storm wants to pull it higher its a bit of a tug of war right now
7621426 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7621427 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7621428 i think the key here of course is that the retail banking operations of these banks at least remain stable because that to me is the backbone of these banks
7621429 a lot of the problems that have occurred have been more on the investment banking side and so retail banking is going to be something which should be focused on
7621430 this ruling actually gives us the opportunity to bring in the argument that this could impact electric power reliability in new york that the actual construction challenges may make it unfeasible
7621431 we still have to determine if building cooling towers is in the public interest
7621432 given that the insurgency remains particularly rural it is garda worlds assessment that there is little evidence to indicate the current trend will change over the short to mid term
7621433 it becomes clearer therefore that the recent august 2008 attacks are less part of a worrying strategic shift in increased terrorist activity but more part of a periodic peak similar to those highlighted above
7621434 the non compete basically tied them up from operating in any of the high growth highly attractive international areas like colombia mexico venezuela and libya
7621435 our board entered into the definitive agreement with precision only after we were satisfied that it represented the best possible alternative for our shareholders with the greatest certainty of both value and prompt completion
7621436 so goes the dollar so goes the energy complex these days
7621437 the storm is trying to pull the market higher but its not getting much of a boost
7621438 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally

7621450 welcomes the opportunity to explain in detail to the american people and members of this committee the importance of our efforts to revise amp harmonize the attorney general guidelines
7621451 evolved from its traditional law enforcement role with some intelligence community activities into a flexible and efficient member of the intelligence community capable of fulfilling its mandate to be an intelligence driven agency the effort to bring together different sets of attorney general guidelines including those that govern criminal investigations national security investigations and the collection of foreign intelligence is critical for the department of justice all interests would be best served by the fbi having one consolidated amp harmonized set of guidelines providing clear and consistent guidance to agents

7621493 i am deeply humbled by this great honor the years i spent as a nurse were among the most challenging and rewarding of my life today nursing continues to be a passion of mine as i work to raise awareness of important public health issues facing our state and nation including the critical nursing shortage
7621494 it brings me great pride to know that future generations of nurses who graduate from this school will answer this call to service and have the opportunity to make a difference in their communities and our great state

7621517 there would be no chance for mr heim to take control of his fathers money as long as there is no hint or proof for mr heims demise there is no legal basis for german authorities to declare him dead
7621518 i do not see any way the kids can inherit the bank account of their father
7621519 as long as we dont know he is dead we have to assume hes still alive
7621520 we are staying tuned to his case as we are talking about very cruel crimes
7621521 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 20 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
7621522 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7621523 those basic principles have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
7621524 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs

7621526 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7621527 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7621528 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7621529 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7621530 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up
7621531 i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here instead of taking the motorway we took the road up through the brecon beacons i feel at home here
7621532 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
7621533 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7621534 shes been an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy jackson and simon cowell offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7621535 peter nagy was very agitated with the non inclusion of husains works in the summit so just a day before the summit started he called me and asked me to frame a photograph of husain to silently protest against the decision of the organisers of the summit to advice galleries not to display husains works
7621536 it is quite sad that a senior artist like husain is forced to stay out of the country we have been organising events supporting husain since the last 10 years and will continue to do so
7621537 somewhere theres a town where the roads are covered in red and violet roses the people sleep through a thousand years of sadness lord you couldnt wake them if you wanted to
7621538 go for it give it your best try and see how it suits you

7621548 we had just let him out for the morning and he ran into the yard and started barking his head off
7621549 i saw flesh and body parts flying through the sky
7621550 the walls covered with blood even the teacups filled with blood
7621551 i blame the iraqi government for this security deterioration because it started to chase sahweh leaders out of the city

7621559 eu quero apenas deixar isto totalmente claro n o podemos arcar com mais quatro anos das pol ticas falidas do presidente bush
7621560 estou ansiosa para estar presente na casa branca quando o presidente obama assinar uma lei que crie um sistema de sa de barato e de qualidade para todos os norte americanos

7621564 daddy gave me this elmo band aid last night and it is special to me
7621565 this specialty pencil goes by many names such as wax pencil grease pencil or china marker it provides a good solution when you have to write or draw on a smooth surface to which most other writing tools do not adhere such as glass metal polished stone ceramics plastic and mylar it is easily removed from such surfaces with a dry tissue
7621566 i dont know how much this trade will cost me
7621567 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7621568 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying
7621569 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show
7621570 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7621571 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the screen would be amazing
7621572 it would take dr who to the next level so should be very successful
7621573 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too
7621574 comenzar a afectarnos a partir de esta tarde y esta noche con fuertes aguaceros tormentas el ctricas y r fagas de vientos principalmente las regiones noreste sureste y suroeste

7621579 i think he wants to fight those big mega fights because thats the kind of fight we want to be involved with right now
7621580 i think its a combination of seeing what the potential opponent is and also seeing what karo joins the quinton club
7621581 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7621582 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7621583 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7621584 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7621585 come face to face with models of insects and other invertebrate animals up to 400 times their actual size
7621586 spent 12 hour days in a canvas blind 90 feet above the forest floor he was a virtual lightning rod as thunderstorms approached the wildlife photographer struggled to remain motionless in the intense humidity while sweat bees drank from his skin down on the forest floor he crouched in water holes for days on end waiting for the perfect moment while fungus sprouted on his equipment and leaf cutter ants ate through his tent
7621587 on the 100th anniversary of john james audubons death a fifth grader in des moines iowa discovered his calling in life
7621588 im continually amazed with the flexibility and power of the system when i made my purchase i hadnt even considered many of the benefits that today i couldnt do without
7621589 i wanted to let you know that your products saved me big time i was heading out of town for the weekend when about 20 miles from home i got a text message from my grow saying that a flood was detected i immediately realized that i hadnt replaced the return tube from my system back in the reservoir i hopped right off the freeway and headed back home i have everything setup so that before it even sent me the text message the feed pump was turned off when i got home less then a gallon of my 55 gallon reservoir had leaked onto the floor it only took 1 towel to clean it up i spent alot of time last weekend thinking about what would have happened if the entire 55 gallons went onto the floor so needless to say buying was the best money i ever spent on my grow and you can quote me on that
7621590 i was a skeptic at first about the benefits of automating my grow but i am no longer ive just finished my most productive harvest to date and im giving here is what maximum yield had to say may june 2007 page 104 automation system provides the highest degree of cutting edge control over your growing environment
7621591 the possibilities are staggering the system allows for a level of control flexibility and peace of mind that cannot be realized with conventional methods
7621592 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
7621593 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discreet charm
7621594 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case anymore
7621595 they themselves have claimed responsibility of several suicide attacks and the government cannot engage in a dialogue with such people
7621596 pakistans leadership has clearly stated their commitment to pursuing and eliminating terrorism and securing pakistans borders for the benefit of its own citizens
7621597 our organization is neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7621598 i am very certain that people at fifa and the confederation of african football caf are understanding enough not to sanction such a match
7621599 if anything we will still be mourning our president since the period has now been extended to 21 days
7621600 its our prayer as government that our request will be heard
7621601 the united nations urges restraint and calls for the immediate establishment of a humanitarian corridor so that the injured may be evacuated
7621602 severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection under international humanitarian law
7621603 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp
7621604 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7621605 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp we have 27 confirmed dead including five women and two children
7621606 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7621607 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7621608 our people are inside kalma we are taking a leading role in coordinating organising a convoy of the wounded negotiating with the government and working to ensure a positive outcome to this crisis
7621609 we are in contact with all the parties to find a lasting solution
7621610 its going to be a heavy lift it takes time in our system
7621611 anything that raises the price of electricity is going to be a political problem
7621612 although he was on the top of the company he always was part of a team with us
7621613 he went doing what he loved to do in a blaze of glory he loved living on the edge
7621614 this year he moved up to twin 750s and moved up a class
7621615 so they should be able to breathe a minimum of eight minutes
7621616 its hard to understand why this happened because with todays safety standards it really shouldnt have happened
7621617 i dont understand why it has an eight foot gash on the starboard gunwale unless it violently hooked because great south bay is calm
7621618 these boats are made to run in the ocean so this thing should not open up or crack in great south bay its considered a pond
7621619 we were enforcing the security zone around the race and i noticed the water going everywhere the other 25 foot boat crew was already at the wreck with two coast guardsmen in the water trying to do what they could to get the people out one of the race helicopters dropped a diver who was able to get the emergency hatch open and pull the victims out
7621620 a couple of his teammates in a fit of high spirits took a photo of him sitting on a toilet and in what they saw as a prank circulated this photo to other team members
7621621 this was inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign for which the team members concerned have been suspended from the team
7621622 all three swimmers are very remorseful and have apologised to team management for what was poor judgement on their part and accept the punishment handed down
7621623 its something that both swimming new zealand and the nzoc will have to address its not something that can be ignored
7621624 any time protocol isnt followed it has to be addressed they know that and well look at it in greater depth when we get home
7621625 we only have one rule in the olympic team that we respect one another
7621626 security forces had to open fire when protesters attacked them with stones and sticks
7621627 discourage separatist rallies during which residents have openly paraded green islamic flags and chanted pro militant and anti india slogans
7621628 we are not even being allowed to peep out through windows
7621629 we have called in the army to assist the police in enforcing curfew
7621630 it is very tense out here there are only policemen visible on the streets
7621631 we appeal to the world to rise and save kashmiris
7621632 once attended an auction to buy a thoroughbred and came away with a mule which he rode home even after the mule threw him off and broke his arm
7621633 if we pass this bill which the democrats irresponsibly oppose well solve this problem
7621634 if we bring a new attitude of hopefulness and respect for the world well make the seas higher and the fish more numerous
7621635 our choice wasnt between a benign status quo and the bloodshed of war it was between war and a greater threat dont let anyone tell you otherwise and certainly not a disingenuous filmmaker who would have us believe that saddams iraq was an oasis of peace
7621636 well brian i think looking back there is something to be said for the idea that i will be a better president now than frankly i would have been four years ago
7621637 did you attend a rally in support of stephen pearcy and his hanging of us troops in effigy
7621638 anti war activist stephen pearcy who gained attention from his sacramento home in february when he hung a human shaped form dressed in a military uniform and adorned it with anti war messages charged that the retired air force officer is distancing himself from the protesters who had come to regard brown as one of them
7621639 he was initially holding himself out as an anti war candidate someone who vehemently opposed the war and supported immediate withdrawal now i am not so sure he supports that this is an example of the kind of democrats weve had who have acted basically in a spineless manner
7621640 republicans fund the liberatarian constitutional green s to push the l c g s candidates
7621641 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7621642 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7621643 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7621644 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7621645 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster
7621646 russia needs to respect the territorial independence and sovereignty of georgia
7621647 the status of those two regions in georgia are not a matter for any one country to decide theyre a matter for the international community through the mechanisms at the united nations
7621648 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7621649 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
7621650 we are looking at a number of things we might do
7621651 moskva has today departed toward the black sea fleets naval training range to check its radio controlled weapons and onboard communications systems
7621652 the fact that there are nine western warships in the black sea cannot but be a cause for concern they include two u s warships one each from spain and poland and four from turkey
7621653 after careful review and consideration we are pleased to inform you that we have stopped collecting new york sales tax effective august 21 2008 newegg spokesman bernard luthi wrote in a friday e mail to customers

7621656 we care about our students and want to do everything we can to have a safe and healthy school year
7621657 im asking everyone to try to integrate safe habits into their everyday lives
7621658 brooke and i are thrilled shes the best stepmom a could ever hope for seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mom unless i bat 100 percent perhaps a boy awaits us

7621661 fairest of the months ripe summers queen the hey day of the year with robes that gleam with sunny sheen sweet august doth appear
7621662 the greatest drawback is the way in which it is necessary to eat it it looks awkward enough but what is to be done surrendering such a vegetable from considerations of grace is not to be thought of
7621663 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7621664 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7621665 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7621666 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7621667 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7621668 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7621669 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7621670 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7621671 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7621672 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7621673 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7621674 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7621675 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7621676 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7621677 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7621678 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7621679 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7621680 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7621681 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7621682 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

7621696 acho que se trata de uma falta grave de uma tentativa de mudar as fronteiras da europa por meio da for a ter resultados desastrosos inclusive para a r ssia

7621703 the older generation feels very private about their financial concerns
7621704 its a challenge to overcome that fierce sense of privacy
7621705 its a good way to get the money conversation started
7621706 were trying to get people to understand that costs are going up dramatically and that we are in better position than they are to control costs
7621707 the so called life care contract is not as popular
7621708 people have made a choice that this is the last place they plan to live
7621709 clearly those of us who sell life care contracts are taking a risk
7621710 the southeastern conference has entered into an historic 15 year agreement with espn that makes the sec the most widely distributed conference in the country
7621711 well show over 5 500 events over the next 15 years including every football game every conference mens basketball game as well as unprecedented numbers of womens basketball games and olympics sports
7621712 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7621713 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7621714 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7621715 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7621716 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7621717 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7621718 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7621719 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7621720 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7621721 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7621722 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

7621760 i used to tell people that obama not hillary was the real clinton
7621761 up to now the slightest criticism of radical islam on campus has been slammed as islamophobia while muslim groups and their radical fellow travelers have been allowed to say the most hateful things imaginable about christians and jews without any reaction from university administrators whatsoever
7621762 provost nikias has called the hadith on the msa website for what it is despicable given the atmosphere that prevails on most campuses today it was an act of integrity on his part to make this call and to demand that the msa live up to basic standards of civility that should govern the university
7621763 abu huraira reported allahs messenger may peace be upon him as saying the last hour would not come unless the muslims will fight against the jews and the muslims would kill them until the jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say muslim or the servant of allah there is a jew behind me come and kill him
7621764 the passage you cited is truly despicable and i share your concerns about its being on the usc server we did some investigations and i have ordered the passage removed
7621765 the passage in the hadith that you brought to our attention violates the usc principles of community and it has no place on a usc server
7621766 no one has the right to denigrate another human being on the basis of race sex sexual orientation national origin etc we will not tolerate verbal or written abuse threats harassment intimidation or violence against person or property
7621767 we commend usc for having the moral courage to stand up against those who hijack speech and religious freedoms and the goodwill of the campus community in order to spread hate and extremist violence
7621768 it also shows what kind of an organization the muslim students association is which is why the freedom center has launched a nationwide campaign stop the jihad on campus week which will culminate the week of october 13

7621873 there is no need for us to be provoked by our feelings or be provoked to defend our own ideologies by the means of threatening or hitting anyone these acts are not healthy for the development of democracy in malaysia
7621874 that place is small and if anything happens it could interfere with the journey of people who are going there to vote
7621875 that is why the police have released a statement to all those who are not voters to not come into permatang pauh on by election day as to prevent any traffic congestion or any untoward incidents like the one on nomination day
7621876 so my hope is for the people who love and appreciate our democracy to evade the incidents from recurring by coming in huge crowds in order to disrupt the situation in permatang pauh
7621877 in this by election alone so many issues have already been brought up there are 26 cases involving the use of violence verbal insults threats stopping people from going to campaign and removing campaign posters and uttering seditious claims

7621888 while this billboard itself wasnt sexualising children it was placing sex before them
7621889 given what was happening in the community and the senate inquiry into the sexualisation of children in the media we considered that there had been a definite shift in community standards
7621890 there will always be certain hot points within the community that are of concern
7621891 the boards role is to walk the line between advertisers being able to advertise their product and the community not being offended
7621892 now its been brought to a head and we have to find a new message
7621893 the challenge is for us to come up with something clever
7621894 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
7621895 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
7621896 to date the cftc has found that supply and demand fundamentals offer the best explanation for the systematic rise in oil prices
7621897 regardless of their classification the cftcs market surveillance group scrutinizes daily the positions of all large traders both commercial and non commercial to guard against market manipulation
7621898 when the cftc granted the 1991 hedging exemption to j aron a division of goldman sachs it signaled a major shift that has since allowed investors to accumulate enormous positions for purely speculative purposes
7621899 legitimate businesses that hedge and take physical delivery of oil are being trampled by the speculators who are in the market purely to make profit

7621928 ten thousand commandments an annual snapshot of the federal regulatory state gives us the following information
7621929 we elected one hundred senators 435 congressmen one president who collectively appointed nine supreme court justices who are directly legally morally and individually responsible for the domestic problems that we face in this country today
7621930 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7621931 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7621932 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7621933 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7621934 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7621935 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7621936 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7621937 who are open to doing something on the production side
7621938 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7621939 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7621940 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7621941 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7621942 which existing supreme court justice would you not have nominated

7621977 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7621978 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7621979 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7621980 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7621981 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7621982 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7621983 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7621984 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7621985 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7621986 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7621987 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7621988 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7621989 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7621990 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7621991 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7621992 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7621993 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7621994 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7621995 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7621996 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7621997 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7621998 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7621999 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7622000 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7622001 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7622002 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7622003 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7622004 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7622005 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

7622011 it is unfortunate that upadhyay is unnecessarily trying to create confusion and indirectly labelling allegations on the chief ministers office without doing his homework on the issue
7622012 the officials marked the area with a pen and mentioned the name of the lady coincidentally when the chief secretary directed mdda to post the map on its website to invite suggestions from the public the same map was uploaded to the site in november 2006
7622013 upadhyay should have taken full information about the issue before making such irresponsible remarks in front of media persons he should accept his mistake and apologize immediately

7622021 the railways had allowed 19 shoeshine boys at the cst and up to six each at masjid bunder and sandhurst road said officials in the know who requested anonymity for lack of authorisation to speak to the media

7622078 many of these new phones are not on the list of nokias voip compatible handsets
7622079 it is not clear how the older phones are going to be impacted a reader tipped us off about this apparent change in the latest n series phones
7622080 much of this growth will be driven by rising subscriptions with 16 6 million people expected to sign up to a voip service this year
7622081 this represents a 21 2 per cent rise in subscribers from 2007 the number of businesses choosing voip technology for their telephony will also rise by 44 5 per cent to 2 190 establishments nationwide ibisworld senior analyst george von horn said by 2012 revenue from the voip market is expected to grow 90 2 per cent to top 4 88 billion
7622082 from truphones perspective nokia has removed the voip client from all the n series phones for the planned future we are putting in a replacement client functionality so that existing customers are not orphaned
7622083 since vowlan is more popular with the corporations nokia cant afford to remove the voip functionality
7622084 it is one feature that makes the phones more competitive with say blackberry

7622100 surprisingly the median household is just as good as the average professional economist

7622200 in cricket the captain is expected to put his stamp on the team
7622201 he has to drive that while trying to keep his own game in shape it takes up a lot of mental energy there is a maximum time you can do the job and five years which is what michael vaughan did is about the limit
7622202 i scored a test hundred just before i took the job and the next one i made came a day after id decided to quit thats a powerful coincidence
7622203 id grown up wanting to play cricket for england at test and one day level and the test bit was about to be taken away from me because i wasnt scoring runs
7622204 the captaincy never really allowed me to get away from the game and recharge my batteries which i used to be able to do when you come close to losing your test spot it hits you hard so thats why i made the decision
7622205 i knew i was going on the thursday but when he said to me he was off too i thought bloody hell two captains going at once doesnt look too good but it was pure coincidence i made the decision and then went out and scored a hundred on the friday the weight off my shoulders just freed me up
7622206 the incident at the oval did take a lot of energy out of me because it doesnt just go away overnight
7622207 decisions like that do haunt you for a time afterwards which adds to the drain on mental energy

7622230 we are eager to deliver this product into the market at this time we believe the chexpress product with its advanced capabilities and reasonable price point will help accelerate the adoption of remote deposit capture applications by financial institutions and their merchant and small business customers

7622344 now that the state of massachusetts is paying for the care they realize and admit that mandates are burdensome and expensive
7622345 delaware needs to go in a new direction people should not be forced to pay for coverage they will never use they should be given the choice of the coverage they desire including covering their own specific needs the state shouldnt mandate a one size fits all solution that drives up the cost for everyone
7622346 at the core of the lee copeland health care plan is a provision allowing anyone in delaware who purchases health care to purchase a plan from any state in america provided that the state where the plan is offered has approved that plan

7622419 shamrock is by far the toughest test of kimbos young career
7622420 he is no stranger to big tough fights ken realizes this is his opportunity to add a storybook finish to an illustrious career he says hes seen holes like swiss cheese in kimbos game
7622421 we see a tremendous fight for the casual mma fan that has caught on to guys like kimbo while at the same time appealing to the hardcore fans who have grown up with ken shamrock
7622422 we feel this will test kimbo and the maturation of his mma game ken being a veteran of the game is going to look to expose kimbos weaknesses its time for kimbo to show his continued growth and the knowledge that he now has and put himself in a situation for the biggest victory of is career
7622423 its pretty simple for kimbo slice he wants to become the worlds most dangerous man and he wants to become the future elitexc heavyweight champ the only way for him to achieve those two things is going through ken shamrock
7622424 if ken shamrock wins this fight hes on top of the world again hes once again proven that he is the most dangerous man in the world he beat the guy that many consider one of the most unpredictable and dangerous strikers in the heavyweight division
7622425 help me out here madame speaker when does life begin
7622426 and if two men strive and smite a woman with child and her child be born imperfectly formed he shall be forced to pay a penalty as the womans husband may lay upon him he shall pay with a valuation 23 but if it be perfectly formed he shall give life for life 24 eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot
7622427 sometimes indeed this lustful cruelty or if you please cruel lust resorts to such extravagant methods as to use poisonous drugs to secure barrenness or else if unsuccessful in this to destroy the conceived seed by some means previous to birth preferring that its offspring should rather perish than receive vitality or if it was advancing to life within the womb should be slain before it was born
7622428 but if it has been formed he shall give soul for soul
7622429 some go so far as to take potions that they may insure barrenness and thus murder human beings almost before their conception
7622430 seeds are gradually formed in the uterus and it is not reputed homocide until the scattered elements receive their appearance and members
7622431 precisely for this reason over and above all scientific debates and those philosophical affirmations to which the magisterium has not expressly committed itself the church has always taught and continues to teach that the result of human procreation from the first moment of its existence must be guaranteed that unconditional respect which is morally due to the human being in his or her totality and unity as body and spirit
7622432 a woman who deliberately destroys a fetus is answerable for murder and any fine distinction between its being completely formed or unformed is not admissible among us

7622504 this new law allows kind hearted individuals to offer assistance to animals during emergency situations without fear of retribution
7622505 disasters can happen at any time and good people should not be in fear of punishment for offering their help in a time of need

7622586 i can assure you that if i am president advancing the cause of life will not be above my pay grade
7622587 id love to see a point where it is irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary
7622588 but certainly in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe v wade which would then force x number of women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
7622589 but now as the mccain campaign seeks to woo disaffected clinton supporters the campaign appears to be playing the other side of the coin
7622590 but certainly in the short term or even the long term i would not support repeal of roe v wade which would then force x number of women in america to undergo illegal and dangerous operations
7622591 we are going into the future what did i walk into a time capsule

7622603 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7622604 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7622605 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7622606 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it

7622617 elephant numbers in the 790 000 hectare 1 9 million acre park have dropped from 2 889 in 1960 to fewer than 200 today
7622618 it has been another bad month for elephants in virunga national park in the past few weeks at least seven elephants were killed in the rwindi area including the two that i blogged about earlier this month we dont have a photos yet but hopefully the rangers on the ground in rwindi will send us some in the next couple days there have been several press reports about the more recent killings including on bloomberg it is clear that we must find a solution that will remove the armed groups from the interior of the park unless we do something soon there will be no elephants left
7622619 our constituents have had some concerns about the program for a while
7622620 however the expansion of the program by geoff plant and the upcoming olympics has pushed us to try to clarify the rules around private security guard conduct in relation to the homeless
7622621 geoff plant knows the populations that are getting moved along by the ambassadors
7622622 hes commissioned a panhandler study that surely says exactly what we allege that aboriginal people and disabled people are targeted by this program disproportionately hes a lawyer he knows thats discrimination

7622648 about 2 oclock in the morning saturday morning we got a call that the surgery was not going well
7622649 so my husband and i went back to the hospital and it was pretty clear at that point he could not be saved
7622650 through their grief the thought his parents keep coming back to is he died doing what he loved
7622651 the doctor explained it like this theres no way to explain it
7622652 he was really great i remember he always used to make me laugh
7622653 it was a bittersweet start unlike anything ive ever experienced
7622654 we just want to help them to express their feelings and make sure that they know no matter what they feel whether its anger or pain or confusion its all okay
7622655 this is a child who trained daily and there are a list of goals on his door the first one is to start on the football team at reynolds high school and he did

7622658 shes the best stepmom sam lola and cassandra could ever hope for seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mom unless i bat 100 percent perhaps a boy awaits us
7622659 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7622660 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
7622661 cutting off support that will save the lives of thousands of american troops
7622662 and look tim if you tell me ive got to take away this protection for these kids in order to win the election some things arent worth it some things are worth losing over that would be worth losing over hundreds of lives are being saved and will be saved by us sending these vehicles over which we are funding with this supplemental legislation and i want to ask any of my other colleagues would they in fact vote to cut off the money for those troops to protect them thats the right question this isnt cutting off the war this is cutting off support that will save the lives of thousands of american troops
7622663 i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7622664 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of each of those countries within the first year i was elected president absolutely positively no
7622665 the last thing you want to do is telegraph to the folks in pakistan that were about to violate quote their sovereignty
7622666 a nd im told senator obama announced today senator lantos sic and i wrote into law the requirement that the aid to pakistan be conditioned upon their support of us going after al qaeda in their western province it already is a law the question the way to deal with it is not to announce it is to do it the last thing you want to do is telegraph to the folks in pakistan that were about to violate quote their sovereignty putting musharraf in a position that makes it virtually impossible for him to do anything other than what hes done basically cut a deal with the warlords along that border to our great detriment so its not something you talk about
7622667 cher is nolans first choice to play catwoman he wants to her to portray her like a vamp in her twilight years
7622668 the new catwoman will be the absolute opposite of michelle pfeiffer and halle berrys purring creations
7622669 the significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them
7622670 only when the last tree has died and the last river has been poisoned and the last fish has been caught will we realize we cant eat money

7622672 helix will be available today for the fairly reasonable price of 1000 wii points but for those who dont know how much that is its roughly 800 microsoft points hope that makes things clearer for you
7622673 given that the insurgency remains particularly rural it is garda worlds assessment that there is little evidence to indicate the current trend will change over the short to mid term
7622674 it becomes clearer therefore that the recent august 2008 attacks are less part of a worrying strategic shift in increased terrorist activity but more part of a periodic peak similar to those highlighted above

7622769 hace casi ya tres a os empezamos a ver qu tipos de proyectos pod amos comenzar a desarrollar y nos encontramos por cosas del destino con esta iniciativa que se estaba desarrollando hace mucho tiempo con mucho xito en estados unidos y en europa y de la que no exist a ninguna experiencia ni en chile ni en sudam rica
7622770 en noviembre del a o 2005 nos invitan a participar a una jornada mundial de los bancos del tiempo en barcelona vamos y nos damos cuenta que esto es un movimiento s per potente a nivel mundial y que es muy exitoso
7622771 principalmente estaba el mito de que la gente no participa que no est ni ah
7622772 pero no es que no participe sino que no existen muchas oportunidades pero cuando tu le llevas una instancia la gente est vida de hacerlo pero hay que ir armando y tejiendo esas instancias
7622773 si bien este no es un banco comercial funciona bajo la din mica de los bancos pero la diferencia es que aqu los vecinos y vecinas en vez de acercarse y depositar plata lo que depositan es tiempo habilidades servicios
7622774 la contraprestaci n que ellos reciben es que tienen a su disposici n las habilidades y los servicios del resto de los vecinos y vecinas que se han inscrito
7622775 en europa lo que se hace es que quedan al alero de las municipalidades por lo tanto se instala en el interior de la municipalidad est un poco monitoreada por esa municipalidad y esa municipalidad tiene injerencia sobre ella es decir es una cosa mixta
7622776 nosotros si bien hacemos alianzas con distintas organizaciones con municipalidades y organismos del estado en el fondo es para que ellos sean coadyuvantes de proveer de los fondos necesarios para la implementaci n que nos ayuden en el trabajo territorial pero hemos hecho la apuesta jugada de transferir las sucursales completamente a la comunidad y que despu s queden completamente administrada por ella para que dure lo que ellos quieran que dure esta experiencia en esa comunidad
7622777 hoy d a est n funcionando con mucho xito con mucha participaci n de parte de los vecinos existen m s de 100 cuentacorrentistas es decir vecinos y vecinas que se encuentran inscritos en las sucursales y adem s hay un alto n mero de horas de servicio efectivamente transado
7622778 por ejemplo si eres vecino de la sucursal el belloto sur en quilpu tu vas conversas con quien es el responsable por ejemplo gladys que es agente de esa sucursal y le dices mira yo quiero ser miembro del banco del tiempo
7622779 ella te va a contar en qu consiste t vas a llenar una peque a ficha de inscripci n vas a firmar el reglamento que son doce principios de c mo funciona y en el que te comprometes a respetar el funcionamiento
7622780 por lo tanto cuando tu necesites un servicio vas a ver tu listado y vas a llamar por tel fono directamente a la persona
7622781 se ala dorfman de este modo los agentes tambi n pueden llevar un control de las horas que se transan en la sucursal
7622782 esperamos inaugurar de aqu a 30 d as tres sucursales m s en virtud de una alianza que hicimos con el injuv que tiene una red de infocentros a nivel nacional
7622783 aqu las instalamos en el inforcentro que tiene en injuv en puente alto en el sindicato n mero uno de la ex papelera en macul en el infocentro que est dentro del club deportivo santa julia y en la unidad vecinal n mero 32 de conchal
7622784 hay dos cosas importantes la molestia que sienta l medel por la fractura en si que ha sido m nima y lo otro fue la tolerancia que tenga a la m scara que se le confecci n pero tambi n ha sido buena trabaj en cancha y no tuvo inconvenientes ni en la parte visual ni el peso
7622785 la idea es que siga toler ndola bien para que pueda jugar el jueves
7622786 siempre hay un riesgo cuando existe una fractura en evoluci n pero son m nimos cuando han pasado d as y ya hay un callo que es una cicatrizaci n inicial del hueso y jugar a con una protecci n bastante firme que le protege la zona
7622787 uno cuando no suma de a tres y si los otros resultados no se dan a tu favor obviamente que pierdes puntos pero nosotros ya quedamos libres y por eso tenemos que estar tranquilos tratar de seguir sumando ganar el domingo y mientras estemos arriba va a depender de nosotros
7622788 no podemos venirnos abajo ni nada por el estilo fue un empate y sirvi para ganar un punto
7622789 fue un partido feo para todos nadie se tiene que caer porque a todos les puede pasar el equipo no anduvo bien y sebasti n tiene muchos a os en esto tiene las condiciones de un gran jugador y esto es pasajero
7622790 la verdad es especial nunca jugu en este tipo de canchas es un pasto bastante bueno pero creo que no son las condiciones ideales para nosotros

7622852 i was choking on my teeth and my bones and i was spitting them out i knew that i was in bad shape
7622853 i just didnt know how bad i did a quick self assessment by taking my hand and feeling the back of my head to see if the bullet went through it didnt

7622867 when as children we visited my grandmother part of the fun was making faces at mrs wilcoxs grandchildren one banner day we put a snake into the wilcox rain barrel my grandmother made token protests but we sensed tacit sympathy
7622868 dont think for a minute that this was a one sided campaign mrs wilcox had grandchildren too grandma didnt get off scot free never a windy washday went by that the clothesline didnt mysteriously break with the clothes falling in the dirt
7622869 i dont know how grandma could have borne her troubles so long if it hadnt been for the household page of her daily boston newspaper
7622870 when i was about sixteen mrs wilcox died in a small town no matter how much you have hated your next door neighbor it is only common decency to run over and see what practical service you can do the bereaved grandma neat in a percale apron to show that she meant what she said about being put to work crossed the lawn to the wilcox house where the wilcox daughters set her to cleaning the already immaculate front parlor for the funeral and there on the parlor table in the place of honor was a huge scrapbook and in the scrapbook pasted neatly in parallel columns were grandmas letters to sea gull over the years and sea gulls letters to her though neither woman had known it grandmas worst enemy had been her best friend that was the only time i remember seeing my grandmother cry i didnt know then exactly what she was crying about but i do now she was crying for all the wasted years which could never be salvaged

7622886 the lord is an archaic term of your dead grandparents it is an old amulet which your grandparents used to wear but they have died off we shall teach you how to till the earth how to fatten the body and how to dig for gold which shines more brilliantly than the dead lord
7622887 i shall do nothing to them for they have done everything to curse their own seed and breed truly they have prepared a worse judgment for themselves and their people than the scribes
7622888 in their old age they will hear sabers rattling at their threshold and will be dying of hunger bald and gaunt and they will not dare to poke their heads out of their door to warn their students how will they warn them when my name has been expelled from their brigand hearts what will they even say to warn them since they prepared their students for this in their own abysmal stupidity which accompanies everyone whom i do not accompany
7622889 it will be worse for them than for the babylonians when in their might they used to worship blood and gold and used to teach their children to worship them also
7622890 first will come hunger such as even babylon never knew and then war for the sake of plundering bread from which they will return defeated and then an internecine slaughter and burning of cities and towns and then diseases which the hands of physicians will not dare to touch and the teachers will be flogged with whips and goaded to be the gravediggers of their students whose stenchful corpses fill all the road ways
7622891 they are leading the people astray for the sake of their own profit and once the people arise and rise up these leaders will step down from power and consume their ill gotten gains in peace
7622892 they flatter idiots and bullies just to attain the first places they write books daily and expose the wickedness of their kinsmen in order to conceal their own wickedness
7622893 they do not teach the people the truth but feed them lies the year round
7622894 they are incapable of doing the people justice so instead they intimidate them by scaring them with a worse injustice of times past
7622895 they pillage for themselves and their friends for they know that they are not long for this world
7622896 they have done everything themselves and i have nothing to do except to leave them to themselves truly they will not consume their gains in peace but will spend it on the funeral feasts of their relatives
7622897 they will be impoverished and mice will scurry through their torn shirts they will dream of rebellions by those who have been deluded and looted and they will arise at midnight terrified and soaked with sweat their life will be long so that their punishment may be longer
7622898 they will live to see their house in flames and will flee their own land hungry and sickly and will not dare to utter their own names in the presence of anyone
7622899 they will see foreigners in their land and will beg them for a piece of bread
7622900 it will be worse for their country than it was for the roman empire for they had rome for an example and did not learn from it
7622901 it will be worse for their nation which was born of them than it was for the jewish nation for they had the example of the jewish nation and did not learn from it
7622902 they will hear their names being cursed and will not dare to poke their heads out the window
7622903 they will see their people being led away bound in columns and will be afraid for themselves
7622904 and they will hear both when asleep and when awake their name being cursed and they will shiver they will shiver but will be unable to die
7622905 i wait to see who will cry out to me and i will respond
7622906 as long as there is crying out on earth there will also be an echo in heaven

7623013 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces

7623025 certainly we made mistakes and unfortunately we were impacted by factors beyond our control including the current economic environment and state of the travel industry we came close to realizing a different outcome for our venture but as the saying goes close doesnt count at the end of the day despite a well received market leading product and early success with strategic partners such as orbitz and alaska airlines we simply ran out of money to continue executing on our vision

7623035 were going to start talking about whether we should be involved in responding outside the city limits to fires that volunteer guys should be responding to
7623036 those are citizens who dont live in charleston and according to this groups legislative alert theyre bragging about beating our bill in the legislature i have a problem with that
7623037 we were able to stop this bill in house finance
7623038 im trying to understand why we should be responding to these calls now
7623039 theres a memorandum of understanding that well help areas of the county that need it but typically volunteer firefighters dont fight fires in the city of charleston and theyre not going to

7623042 when the first fayetteville unit arrived on the scene flames were already through the roof and contained half the building
7623043 firefighting tactics were hindered by the amount of water flow at the closest hydrant
7623044 they had to set up a shuttle system from fayette town center to help contain the blaze there is limited water flow from the hydrants in our town they basically set up a system of two to four trucks shuttling back and forth and supplying the main engine for fire suppression they filled up the main pumping truck by feeding into its 1 000 gallon tank
7623045 due to the total value of the building they wanted to go ahead and bring them fire marshals office in the cause of the fire is undetermined at this time

7623058 i write to remind you that trading class spots for money or goods or offering to do so is a violation of law school rules
7623059 its inappropriate to allocate seating in classes with real money we endeavor to set up a system that distributes classes in a fair way

7623093 the aluminum oxide particle coating material purification has been certified to be in the parts per trillion level achieving these levels of purification are additional major factors in allowing eestor inc the potential to reach its target working voltage eestor inc has certification data from outside sources that purified aluminum oxide in the range that eestor inc has certified can have a voltage breakdown of 1 100 volts per micron the target working voltage of eestors chemical processes is at 350 volts per micron this provides the potential for excellent protection from voltage breakdown
7623094 it has also been certified by mr ian treviranus of horiba instruments inc and the la 950 particle measurement system that eestor inc has achieved their goal of producing powder particles in the range of 1 micron with a very narrow particle size distribution eestor inc has certification data that indicates achieving powder particle of this size and distribution along with the aluminum oxide particle coating assists eestor inc in meeting the energy storage stabilization over the temperature range of interest for key applications

7623481 i will be telling my delegates that i will vote for barack obama

7623492 much has been made of my opponents wealth there are people out there saying that you shouldnt vote for john mccain because he owns seven homes and because he abandoned his first wife and children for a wealthy heiress but thats ridiculous the dangers in voting for john mccain are his policies to summarize 1 he wants to provide tax cuts for millionaires let me repeat that so theres no confusion he wants to provide tax cuts for millionaires unless youre a millionaire or you married one you should find this distressing a few years back john mccain told the american people he couldnt support president bushs tax cuts for millionaires he called them irresponsible but when the election came he sold working americans out he sided with bush cheney 2 his judgment on iraq has been wrong over and over john mccain supported the surge how can this come as a surprise hes supported president bush every step of the way with iraq he is president bushs biggest cheerleader on the war he went on tv to assure americans that the war in iraq would be over in a few months he even assured us the war was over after president bush staged his mission accomplished photo op thats the kind of judgment john mccain has shown on iraq he can try to play the attack dog now but hes always been a bush cheney lapdog on the war the american people are tired of this costly misadventure they dont want it turned into a republican pride drama they want it ended with honor so we can bring our troops home and get our economy working again 3 hes sold his soul to karl rove ask yourself right now how john mccain hopes to govern what are his policies about the only thing most americans know about his policies is that he wants to drill through his own 500 loafers for oil the rest of his campaign has been about attacking me why does the original maverick have so little to say on his own behalf because he knows he cant win on the issues so hes hoping attack ads will be enough to get him elected just like bush and cheney hes sold his soul to karl rove if we as a nation elect politicians who care only about winning not governing who offer smears rather than solutions then we deserve another four years of bush based on the campaign hes running john mccain will deliver that so every time you fall for one of his attack ads just remember what youre really supporting four more years of george w bush

7623505 during the first stage of the project we concentrated on the breeding of predatory bird species why was this necessary unfortunately we have too many grey crows in moscow they do great damage to the natural habitat and attack the protected bird population there however we encouraged the growth of the predatory bird population for they are a natural regulator to the grey crow population therefore by encouraging the breeding rate of the predatory birds we indirectly increased the habitat of the birds that dwell in the moscow nature preserves
7623506 today we encouraged the birth of 20 pheasants and peacocks using artificially encouraged methods in all this year we expect a generation of no less than 100 nestlings next year we plan to begin work on encouraging the breeding of other avian species

7623663 its certainly an interesting competition i guess i was boasting a bit to much when i threw down the challenge what do i know about dresses it will be fun to see what we both come up with
7623664 i certainly dont have an interest for dresses or know what women think when they buy them although i may learn a lot more if i loose and i have to wear one for an entire week suffice to say that i am going to work my ass off i am not about to loose to my protegee and you guys certainly do not want to see me strut around in a little sexy red thing all over town
7623665 is not so much whether st marys should be closed down but whether st marys will close itself down by practices that separate it from communion with the roman catholic church
7623666 in reality st marys south brisbane has taken a roman catholic parish and established its own brand of religion
7623667 undoubtedly it does good it promotes a strong sense of community opens its doors to all who wish to come but its own style of worship and sacramental practice can hardly be described as roman catholic

7623676 roland jabbours claim made in the name of the australian arabic council that anti semitic blood libels and demeaning depictions of jewish people are acceptable in the context of the perceived crimes of the state of israel is deplorable
7623677 australian jews like all other australians have the right to live without being subjected to this kind of vicious defamation
7623678 the statements made by roland jabbour are dishonest and un australian and undermine our multicultural society
7623679 it is also disappointing that to date there has been no public disassociation from or criticism of the remarks by any other arabic or muslim organization within australia of which we are aware

7623687 medically induced coma when the doctors saw the state you were in physically they shut you down something about a build up of crap in your blood and your brain adrenal insufficiency neurotransmitter hypertolerance yadda yadda yadda
7623688 they said it was like you hadnt rested in years like literal years its a wonder youre not dead
7623689 a couple of broken ribs plus they had to do a little graft on your pelvis they said youd chafed the skin right off rubbing it against the top of that old leg of yours the wound was going septic but last time i checked it seemed to be healing up pretty good
7623690 you need to eat and then you need more sleep if you dont theyll send you to sleep chemically
7623691 i cant sleep here id keep the whole ward awake
7623692 youre insulated and youre isolated its your party you can cry if you want to
7623693 why tell me you have a friend or something who gives a shit what you do and dont like
7623694 if you have a problem with the way im running things youre more than welcome to get out of that bed to teach me a thing or two
7623695 better get this down fast before the nurse catches us bitch has a hate on for outside food its worse than the movies in this place
7623696 nobody does they download them the popcorns cheaper that way now let me prop you up and well shove some barley into that sour puss pie hole of yours
7623697 beautiful how can something thats screwing up the laws of physics be beautiful i mean people have died
7623698 but the spiral of a hurricane cloud can be beautiful the pyroclastic plume of a volcano can be beautiful there was no one around to see the moon break away from the earth but im sure that was beautiful too in some terrible way if not beautiful at least grand at least awesome somehow
7623699 i was born like this more helpless than anyone has any right to be
7623700 and i guess i could have hated the world for it but the world doesnt care the world is too magnificent and horrible to have a hand in justice it is too overwhelming and too complex too surprising to be anything but innocent on the level of men thalidomide did what it did to me because of the geometry of its molecules nothing more
7623701 i can either forgive or not forgive doctors for making the mistake of giving it to my mother but for the effects of it the world doesnt need my forgiveness it is irrelevant
7623702 because molecules are not any more evil than hurricanes they simply are if a hurricane is responsible for its cruelty why not the placid days that preceded it and seeded the future existence of the storm
7623703 no destruction and evil are not synonymous but what i saw in those tunnels it was not the product of a storm it was will
7623704 you were satisfied to think you were facing a showdown with nature but a showdown with sinners isnt what you bargained for it wont give you what you want and you know it
7623705 vengeance the worlds been beating you up since before you were born and you might say nature doesnt need your forgiveness but i think thats bull youve been stalking nature for decades youve vowed to bring control to something out of control to reign in something terrible to save some lives
7623706 and maybe all these years you just werent man enough to admit that there was something in it for you too a chance to put nature over your knee and smack her ass for giving you such a hard time
7623707 why debate it youll accept the facts when you have to i guess
7623708 its one of your case report archives those huffers in thunder bay thats some weird shit right there
7623709 youll what fall out of bed and bite my ankles
7623710 im a fucking rock star being reprehensible is part and parcel
7623711 i thought when you were wearing your glasses you were aglakti not cherry nuk nuk
7623712 my clark kents its a shallow disguise cherrys never far beneath the surface
7623713 im not reading this to mess with your shit mr miss im reading it so i can be prepared because you know what it doesnt matter what were going to face were going to face it and before you even start your bleating let me tell you something youre not facing it alone youre just not end of story
7623714 so what now did you bring me those meter sticks i asked for
7623715 well have to take a taxi because everyone else is waiting down at the hotel
7623716 the moment i have something to use as a hand
7623717 we are some minutes behind so let us proceed without delay are you quite ready monsieur
7623718 why we are from the zhang workshop of course my name is docteur pelletier were you not told monsieur weve put to work the measures we took at the ospital and your new appendages are now ready for installation
7623719 whats with the surgical table what are you planning to do to me
7623720 we are only obliged to insert some small devices under your scalp to read the cerebral signals and transmit instructions to the appendages
7623721 with respect monsieur your previous units were garbage monsieur zhang has come so much further since then you will see it for yourself
7623722 i dont know anything about these new models or whatever we never talked about that im not really sure i can afford it you know
7623723 madamoiselle it is nothing monsieurs bill has already been paid
7623724 if youll allow me monsieur the battery pack nestles here at the small of the back oui comme ci it is somewhat larger than what you are used to but allow me to give you my assurance that you would never want to go back the period between charging is now multiplied by six the torque by eight
7623725 an andle monsieur the lozenge at the tip is a bite plate for use as a lever worked by the mouth this is to facilitate the attaching and the removal of appendages with a minimum of assistance
7623726 carbon nanotube muscle fibre bundles of course as you are quite accustomed to but now they can be moved with a tenth of the input voltage with double the strength and a smaller response time the most novel new feature however
7623727 completely autonomous reactions triggered by extreme heat or even sudden mechanical compression
7623728 there is a processor monsieur though not an ordinary one for this design m zhang has taken the concept of muscle memory to its most literal conclusion your limbs contain a carbon nanoworks based decentralized intelligence this system not only runs programmes for reflexes and transcoding firing signals but it is also capable of learning
7623729 learning your stride monsieur the more use you make of the legs for instance the more rapidly they will accommodate your shifts in balance the learning is modal also you can switch gears so to speak from a walking mode to a running mode by means of the control implants under the scalp in time the system will guess when you wish to move in a certain way but for the time being it must be trained
7623730 by thinking monsieur changes in your brainwaves are detected by the system and translated into locomotive commands to find the mental objects that produce the desired waves is a matter of trial and error and much practice some people have an easier time than others the key is learning to be sensitive to the quality of your own mind and to alter it at will
7623731 naturally because you have been making use of the ulnar nerve as a mechanism of control for many years we have also introduced an auxiliary system that works in the same way in order to make the transition more easy however i am obliged to warn you these appendages will need time for you to acclimate to their function do not expect miracles right away monsieur
7623732 gentlemen we can rebuild him we have the technology we can make him better stronger faster
7623733 im getting the feel of the thumb index and middle fingers i think
7623734 but the other three fingers only move as a unit
7623735 you will need hundreds of hours of practice to perfect your control monsieur you must be patient you have hard work ahead of you but just imagine monsieur in a matter of months you will be walking again
7623736 yes monsieur force and balance feedback are part of the new proprioception engine to assist you in orienting without external stimuli
7623737 but its like i can hear the shape of myself
7623738 indeed monsieur the proprioception engine targets nerves in the ears to better coordinate with the bodys natural register for balance it has been calibrated according to tomography from your particular brain as each man is in his nervous system unique in certain ways how this additional input is interpreted by your mind is at least equally idiosyncratic
7623739 unfortunately m zhang insists on writing his technical documentation in the form of traditional chinese poetry
7623740 this is an approximate translation everything is explained in terms of qi life energy and liang yi ratios a glossary has been inserted on the final page if you are not familiar with han superstition
7623741 watch it there crazy legs im a girl not a pole
7623742 well its our tour bus now i guess come on lets go say hello to everybody
7623743 mr miss this is your official mission engineer phat so kim on loan from queens university
7623744 holy crap mr miss i never thought id see you again
7623745 well thats what he does when im on tour were still uh figuring out his exact role on team mississauga
7623746 wheres my fucking vodka and who stole my fucking sunglasses fuck
7623747 hey mate can i bum a fag were like waiting for some kind of fucking cripple to show up
7623748 um that would be him red this is detective mississauga
7623749 fuck off really hes pretty tall for a guy with no fucking legs
7623750 this is father bellamy chief mechanic hes on sabbatical from his congregation in order to spend some time among the layfolk
7623751 phat so tells me i just missed you in kingston last year
7623752 saved your bacon that night didnt we glad you came out of it okay partner
7623753 but how i dont understand aglakti what is this exactly
7623754 this is your crew mr miss this is your posse were team mississauga and were on a mission to kick event zeros ass
7623755 and now that youre here weve got our fearless leader were good to go
7623756 you already know as well as i do mr miss you caught some of those fumes too
7623757 wiyasakami were going north all of us together and then youre going to figure out what event zeros all about and were going to be there to help
7623758 thats what youve inspired were here because were your friends and you cant talk anyone out of it so dont even try now are you going to waste time bitching or are you going to just suck it up and manage
7623759 and how old were you when you started tilting at windmills
7623760 door het gebruik van innovatieve technologie kunnen we dit bijzondere religieuze en culturele centrum voorzien van moderne internetgemakken
7623761 companies and individuals look at the benchmark bloggers like scoble and think its just a matter of tossing some stuff out there to see what sticks
7623762 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7623763 but this is unique we dont know of a quiver like this anywhere else in the world
7623764 we now have the complete bow equipment quiver and arrows
7623765 and we have surprisingly a lot of organic material like leather parts of shoes and a trouser leg that we wouldnt normally find
7623766 the site is exactly at the point where the glacier responds most sensitively to short term climate change and temperature variations
7623767 so if we get more carbon datings from this site we can get the most precise picture of short term glacier fluctuations for the past six or 7 000 years
7623768 but what we do know is that the climate has fluctuated throughout history in the past the driving force for the changes was the earths orbital pattern now the driving force is green house gas emissions
7623769 if leather is exposed to the weather to sun wind and rain it disintegrates almost immediately
7623770 the fact that we still find these 5 000 year old pieces of leather tells us they were protected by the ice all this time and that the glaciers have never been smaller than in the year 2003 and the years following
7623771 now these archaeological findings seem to fit quite nicely with our glacier reconstructions
7623772 this is very important in the debate about climate change in the past the present and also in the future
7623773 up to then we had always thought the alps were not used that people never went there
7623774 you didnt say what you disagreed with in the book
7623775 is easily distinguishable in its insistence on age integration as an ecclesiological principle
7623776 there is no systematic age segregation in the family integrated church
7623777 the family is the evangelism and discipleship arm of the family integrated church

7623779 biden why should russia listen to you they probably have no sic idea who you are now shut up god i hope obama doesnt sic pick him
7623780 the kremlin has tried to force the collapse of democratically elected governments in estonia and georgia and punished the independence of other neighbors by cutting energy deliveries russia also snapped up serbias state oil monopoly as payback for opposing a united nations backed deal to grant kosovo independence any successful strategy for engaging russia must ensure that the regions young states will remain both sovereign and democratic in the true sense of the words
7623781 which includes guarantees of broad political representation an abkhazian vice president the right to veto legislation establishment of a joint free economic zone and international guarantees of autonomy
7623782 these russian actions require a timely robust and intensive diplomatic response from washington
7623783 is unlikely to dramatically deviate from the kremlins current course
7623784 he could be someone the west can work with more effectively than his predecessor
7623785 he has expressed skepticism of russias turn toward authoritarianism by criticizing the governments treatment of political opponents and questioning the merits of sovereign democracy and as an economist he may understand the costs of the kremlins recent bad behavior
7623786 consistently voiced concerns about russia backsliding on democratic reforms under putin
7623787 reaffirm support for the saakashvili government and declare that its removal by the russians would lead to recognition of a government in exile

7623790 who the fuck spilled tabasco on marikos computer thats some shady ass shit right there you bitches
7623791 what time do you think this happened when was your computer in the kitchen
7623792 i said emotional but not in any tears i am making frantic arrangements to kick my trouble making subletters out early so i could return home
7623793 shaunia was just here she wound back the tape of thecamera inthekitchen and you were the only one near your computer no one was in kitchen but you during those times so i get to ask you to leave i get to watch you pack and make sure you return the remotes i get to check you out and give you your money without taking the 25 for being asked to leave
7623794 im not saying what i believe or dont believe i am just doing my job
7623795 wow this whole house is fucking crazy thats fine i was going to leave tomorrow anyway
7623796 yeah lots of mostly stripclub managers but none as bad as you bitch
7623797 you wanna take customers to your house and see them on your own
7623798 but more because we want to make sure shias hand is protected for the remainder of the shoot
7623799 there were a a couple things we couldnt do in transformers due to budget but also because they seemed too out there to the studio some of those things we get to do in the second movie after we see it ill point out which
7623800 yes we do get a bit more dough expect an upgrade and we also know better what we can do this time to maximize the mighty buck and we have the secret weapon that is producer ian bryce
7623801 one of the themes is about the responsibilities you face when being away from home reflected by sam going to college and by the fact that the transformers themselves are of course far from cybertron
7623802 we were emulating the style of movie from the old amblin days like back to the future and gremlins which if you watch today are still very funny also the cartoon itself was quite funny also comedy makes things more accessible to a larger audience
7623803 the first movie is all about the mystery and reveal of the transformers as a concept and a species which means we had to hide them a lot in the first hour in the second movie now that everyone believes in the universe we can jump right into the world of the transformers the hardest aspect is that you lose the element of surprise we got away with a lot in the first movies because for a long time no one thought it would work or that it was just a silly cartoon and simply proving that wrong is all we had to do the first movie was meant to be somewhat of a mystery for the sequel we need an entirely different structure and paradigm for the movie and we cant rely on it being the first

7623807 we are kind of what you call a first line of defense
7623808 there are many districts that are very small and have no school nurses at all
7623809 they lewiston schools are getting minimal services but there are many school districts that arent getting the minimal services
7623810 were not in the buildings long enough to provide those kinds of services
7623811 the state does provide funding for school nurses in the same way that the state provides funding for teachers which is based on a salary grid
7623812 an important part of what im about what makes me tick
7623813 very supportive as soon as he saw what was happening he and i we connect on many levels i mean he knew immediately that she would want to go ive been to georgia with him i know the country
7623814 shes on the phone with the world food program hes on the phone with sakaashvili
7623815 its like this great picture of what theyll be like in the white house
7623816 theres a very serious landmine issue now because there are landmines being laid as we speak
7623817 theres a whole bunch of things going on right now and as we begin to move refugees from point a to point b or try to feed refugees who are stuck in pockets around the country were now running into the issue of the blowing up of humanitarian vehicles that are trying to get to the refugees so its a whole morass of problems now

7623901 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7623902 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7623903 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7623904 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7623905 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy

7623908 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area

7623913 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7623914 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7623915 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7623916 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history

7623940 they didnt need to appoint a special witness to hear the oath because even during the time of prophet muhammad the prophet took along his family when he made a sumpah mubahalah not as witnesses but to prove a truth

7623962 there will be more bank failures but nothing compared with previous cycles such as the savings and loans days
7623963 what is offered for sale is all deposit liabilities insured and uninsured together with the good assets of the bank usually including the bank building itself and certain performing loans in the bank
7623964 insured depositors can still sleep easily and because of that a lot of bankers can sleep easily too
7623965 indymac failure is expected to reduce the fdics designated reserve ratio for its deposit insurance fund to less than 1 15
7623966 then an industry consisting of hundreds of insolvent firms is surely the last institution about which anyone can mention insurance with a straight face
7623967 the banking system in this country remains on a solid footing through the guarantees provided by fdic insurance the overwhelming majority of banks in this country are safe and sound and the chances that your own bank could fail are remote however if that does happen the fdic will be there as always to protect your insured deposits

7623976 not the city which enthusiastically approved the creation of dozens of new neighborhoods without pausing to wonder if it could absorb the growth
7623977 obviously not the speculators turned landlords who thought that they could get san francisco rents in a working class agricultural city ranked by the american lung association as having some of the worst air in the nation
7623978 and sadly not the local folk who moved up and took on more debt than they could afford they believed because who was telling them differently that the good times would be endless
7623979 the belief that this dream could be achieved with no risk no worry and no money down was at the center of the american romance with real estate in the early years of this decade and not just in merced
7623980 how long will the economy have to pay the price for that illusion the experience of merced which rose higher and fell faster than nearly anywhere else suggests that recovery from the national real estate debacle will be painful and protracted

7623994 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party

7624030 investors can take a look at the vice fund vicex which holds investments in alcohol weapons gambling and tobacco stocks

7624107 the event described in numbers 31 is gods vengeance against the midianites for their role in the defiling of israel in numbers 25 we learn that at the suggestion of balaam the israelites were seduced to adultery by the women of midian as a result god commanded moses to strike down the midianites for their treachery numbers 25 16 18 as a side note the israelites were judged for their sin by a plague that killed 24 000 men why such a cruel and bizarre command from moses
7624108 furthermore it was the midianite women who were culpable at baal peor the women who have had sexual relations are killed for their sin and the young boys are killed presumably to prevent any further procreation one can only surmise that the virgins were spared because they didnt participate in the sin at baal peor and because without the young men they couldnt perpetuate the race

7624121 the light we observe started about 7 7 billion years ago this is about half of the age of the universe so it is from quite long ago and quite far away
7624122 the existence of the cluster can only be explained with dark energy
7624123 the fact that we do find these clusters is a clear confirmation of dark energy
7624124 this was a very long time ago and its actually about as massive as the most massive ones we observe today without dark energy we would observe much more massive clusters and many more of these massive clusters than we actually do

7624246 this is absolutely bizarre that we continue to subsidize highways beyond the gasoline tax airlines and we dont want to subsidize a national rail system that has environmental impact this is the ultimate in being penny wise and a pound foolish
7624247 i was in the oval office the other day and the president asked me what i would do about resignations
7624248 i turned back to the president and said mr president dick cheney and don rumsfeld are bright guys really patriotic but theyve been dead wrong on every major piece of advice theyve given you thats why id get rid of them mr president not just abu ghraib they said nothing just sat there like big old bullfrogs on a log and looked at me
7624249 to tell you the truth i had no idea how it is supposed to be spelled
7624250 we are perturbed at the lack of interest by city management in cleaning up vacant buildings
7624251 acho que o meu amigo roberto dinamite come ou errado nestas negocia es a primeira coisa que se tem que fazer entrar em contato com o clube eles entraram em contato primeiro com o atleta sujaram a cabe a dele e depois formularam a proposta na sexta feira com n meros errados
7624252 certo que ag ero um jogador importante para n s
7624253 n o chegou nada oficial mas essa pessoa me ligou para dizer que o hamburgo quer o alex silva
7624254 n o chegou nada oficial at o s o paulo mas essa pessoa me ligou para dizer que o hamburgo quer o alex silva
7624255 estamos aqui porque ainda n o estamos classificados para a liga dos campe es caso contr rio n o estar amos na pol nia mas treinando em casa
7624256 jogaremos a temporada nesta partida estarei muito atento ao comportamento do elenco amanh ter a porque n o devemos encar la superficialmente
7624257 continuo pensando o mesmo que antes do confronto de ida uma equipe que sabe o que faz e tem jogadores muito bons principalmente no setor defensivo e aspectos muito interessantes os campe es de qualquer campeonato sempre merecem muito respeito
7624258 i dont think anybodys going to stop him unless hes convicted
7624259 this support is going on all over the state i think if anything im energized
7624260 shame on all of us for not helping with the project
7624261 after all he has done for us every man woman and child should have chipped in to build our greatest alaskan ever a home the size of the
7624262 we hope our presence demonstrates american solidarity and lifts the morale of the georgian people
7624263 russian troops must withdraw from georgia immediately as they promised to do
7624264 the integrity of the georgian borders must be restored and its national sovereignty must be honored
7624265 we came here with the strong belief that russian troops must leave georgia as promised
7624266 their presence serves no good purpose represents an intimidating force and obstructs the delivery of humanitarian assistance as well as the rebuilding of what they have destroyed america cannot sit idly by in the face of such aggression and the effort to remove the democratically elected leader of a sovereign nation
7624267 what steps this administration would take in the coming months to help prevent further escalation of this conflict
7624268 we will turn our attention to providing the assistance that georgia needs to rebuild its infrastructure proviide humanitarian relief aid its damaged military and help shore up its currency
7624269 we are all going to be in this area for a long time
7624270 engage these statesmen in dialog that might be helpful to georgia

7624274 why do we need more domestic production why do we need more conservation we do we need more free market innovation because we need a commonsense transition to energy independence and energy security

7624276 i do feel there should never be quid pro quo

7624280 its more of a social thing its very rare that business is brought up
7624281 thats not a discussion that i want to get into
7624282 i am pleased to see that gao has followed the mandate senator vitter and i placed in the wrda bill
7624283 i have always believed that if you are going to do something then do it the right way so that you do not have to do it again
7624284 hurricane katrina was a devastating natural disaster for louisiana mississippi and alabama
7624285 another troubling issue raised by the gao report concerns a draft february 2006 report prepared for fema by a consulting firm the national infrastructure support technical assistance consultants nistac on the potential impacts from hurricane debris disposal at the gentilly landfill this report reviewed the debris removal steps taken and indicated serious concerns about the gentilly landfill primary concerns that need further review are the geotechnical and environmental impacts on the adjacent levee of adding katrina related debris to the landfill the report was never finalized and it seems that it was ignored even though it described in detail the numerous environmental issues and concerns coupled with the potential creation of a superfund site by not learning from our mistakes we are doomed to repeat them the agriculture street landfill in new orleans orleans parish was reopened in 1965 to dispose of hurricane betsy debris after being declared a superfund site and placed on the npl national priorities list the agriculture street landfill has a current price tag of almost 22 million dollars to taxpayers
7624286 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters
7624287 as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
7624288 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much
7624289 so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
7624290 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought
7624291 i know you have students who come from all over the world i know there are people here who come from countries some from iraq where they have seen the look of war and sacrifice

7624294 the one returns this time to lead us to the road to denver
7624295 we will encourage voters to look beyond the glamour of barack obamas celebrity status to his inexperience and lack of accomplishment

7624313 with new york state already feeling the financial pinch entergys decision to ditch its ill conceived plan is a huge win for new yorkers

7624318 the equity is virtually worthless and will continue to be
7624319 if the treasury buys preferred stock though i would assume that would validate that class of equity during any liquidation reprivitization

7624523 we know there is a tremendous medical need to address women suffering with low sexual desire
7624524 currently there are no medications approved by the u s food and drug administration fda for the treatment of low sexual desire
7624525 the leading indicator on the race is your gut i started to see the buzz about six weeks ago when i saw the crowd reactions greater and having more energy people want a change
7624526 so lets get this family together and win this election
7624527 the centerpiece of a new energy economy for this nation
7624528 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that ad
7624529 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumor of controversy than the fact of unity
7624530 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so
7624531 fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7624532 at this point the ball is with council staff to develop a proposal that will come back to council over the next few months but it could involve stickers badges posters and t shirts
7624533 we have to create awareness that homophobia is not acceptable
7624534 the young men who come in from outer suburbs to drink alcohol and assault gay people are not going to be deterred by a sticker in a window

7624540 im just very proud of how so many people came together
7624541 we just had so many talented people that put their best forward in every way
7624542 its just kind of cool to see how the game is the same
7624543 we were able to get a lot of old timers in the film it gives it a huge amount of credibility
7624544 your television ads keep saying things that are not true and you have refused to accept my proposals to have a debate
7624545 we need to stand in public and be truthful this is a public building its paid for by taxpayers money and so there is no reason no reason at all that you cannot agree now to a debate
7624546 when we can arrange our schedule we will meet for a debate
7624547 i have a job to do were not going to do it on your demands we have said publicly when we can arrange our schedule we will meet were not going to do it on your demands not here or there ok i expect the invitations soon
7624548 we have both received invitations but kuhl has not responded
7624549 some people want to be disrespectful and want to be interuptive for their own political gain
7624550 this event was not campaign related and it was shamefully and frankly sad that massa tried to turn the attention away from our first responders and back to himself
7624551 and the time for action is now the energy issue is the most critical our country has economically i hope changes will come before the end of the year
7624552 i understand you are trying to make this a political issue but youre not going to
7624553 he said this wasnt a political event today but his only staffer there was his campaign manager
7624554 kuhl has stopped his town hall meetings wont take questions from the public and refuses to respond to invitations to debate the issues of the day
7624555 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year
7624556 we have a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here
7624557 its extremely important to just keep making forward progress rather than prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7624558 ultimately gaza has to be resolved and it has to be resolved on the basis of abu mazens abbass program for it
7624559 our international strategy for scotland needs to be wider than north america australia and new zealand and it needs to look at the modern world in its entirety making scotland a location of choice for tourists from asia who are going to be the biggest tourist market in the world 20 years from now but also those with diaspora connections in other parts of the world im extremely disappointed the first minister has such a limited vision of this but i hope that on reflection he will be willing to think again

7624569 f or joe biden to talk about qualifications hes never run a city hes never run a state hes never run a business
7624570 i dont have to debate you because everyone already knows im right
7624571 its not only or necessarily ahmadinejad who speaks to the imam
7624572 theres a whole new second generation elite of the revolutionary guard irgc who indoctrinate their troops with the belief in the need to hasten the advent of the imam this has also spread to hizballah in lebanon
7624573 he represents a larger elite and wider trend hence he is more dangerous since even if he were to disappear through elections or other means the trend he represents would remain strong this is in contrast to hitler who had he disappeared even as late as 1939 there is great doubt that wwii would have occurred
7624574 the need for the imams loyalists to have the strategic upper hand is a necessary condition for his appearance the upper hand can only be achieved through possession of nuclear weapons
7624575 balance between the supreme leader and the president is no longer clearly in the favor of the former as it was with ahmadinejads predecessors now the president has the direct support of the revolutionary guard the regimes mainstay
7624576 some iran experts believe that ahmadinejad is irrelevant since real power is in the hands of pragmatic clerics this ignores the fundamental shift that has occurred in iran since ahmadinjeads election ahmadjinejad and the revolutionary guards represent a powerful force which can crush domestic opposition this has changed the fundamental balance of power in iran ahmadinejads ability to influence issues of national security goes far beyond any of his predecessors as he proved in his manipulation of the nuclear issue and relations with the west frequently against the wishes of the supreme leader the faction that takes credit for providing iran with a military nuclear capability will grow even stronger as iran comes closer to that goal thats why sanctions wont work they cant work
7624577 the problem isnt that ahmadinejad will unilaterally give an order to attack but the irgcs policy of escalation and brinkmanship could push the entire region to the brink of a nuclear confrontation and then leave no choice but to attack most wars were not premeditated but rather developed out of bad estimates of the situation and what the response would be from the other side
7624578 the very nature of brinkmanship in the middle east can create an escalation of nuclear crisis that can quickly spiral out of control
7624579 there is actually an agreement concluded between the two parties over the definite date which is 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7624580 it was incomplete youre right where players come in is facing that army and moving the story forward for me the most beautiful thing about the cinematic is the heartbreaking dichotomy between arthas fathers hopes and dreams for arthas and what arthas inevitably becomes the cinematic sets the stage it hopefully catches people up a bit on just how tragic the situation is how deeply ingrained the power of the lich king is and how it has spread out like icy tendrils to corrupt everything it touches this is the stage this is arthas and ultimately this is the lich king in all his power set out before you for me i think it is the cinematic i have been most waiting for and most love

7624588 barack obamas father was muslim and therefore according to islamic law so is the candidate in spite of the quranic verses explaining that there is no compulsion in religion a muslim child takes the religion of his or her father for muslims around the world non american muslims at any rate they can only ever see barack hussein obama as a muslim
7624589 he has to be good for arabs because he is a muslim
7624590 he cant be a christian his middle name is hussein
7624591 the symbolism of a major american presidential candidate with the middle name of hussein who went to elementary school in indonesia
7624592 dont really understand obamas family tree but what they do know is that if america despite being attacked by muslim militants on 9 11 were to elect as its president some guy with the middle name hussein it would mark a sea change in america muslim world relations

7624623 a home buyer claiming a 7 500 credit would repay the credit at 500 per year the home owner does not have to begin making repayments on the credit until two years after the credit is claimed so if the tax credit is claimed on the 2008 tax return a 500 payment is not due until the 2010 tax return is filed if the home owner sold the home then the remaining credit amount would be due from the profit on the home sale if there was insufficient profit then the remaining credit payback would be forgiven

7624642 im grateful for the attention because it lets me be a stronger voice for working women and military families i can bring the issues that are important to them to the forefront of a national political discussion its a great gift
7624643 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7624644 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7624645 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7624646 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7624647 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7624648 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7624649 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7624650 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
7624651 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
7624652 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
7624653 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
7624654 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot

7624736 with posts like mr hudsons you are in no position to define this place as a bubble of any type
7624737 ive seen several areas where i have let my desire for a great deal override my judgment and gods principles i have been convicted about it and am now turning things around i know that by taking advantage of the stores companies and deals i am destroying the generosity they have offered and gods trust in me
7624738 my husband and i really are needing to be frugal as we start off our marriage but were trying to do it all to honor the lord and using a coupon i knew wasnt legit was not honoring him and wasnt worth it
7624739 thanks for the discussion very important info that really hits home i think i needed to hear it today
7624740 like others i have used and even posted coupons not intended for me i think couponing can be as bad of an addiction as some of the more obvious bad addictions its probably easier to get away with abusing coupon priviledges and more than likely you wont be arrested for printing a 2 10 cvs coupon but god sees and knows everything we do
7624741 but from this blog i can see that the real issue here is not about the manufacturer or the store its about me and you and our lord not only is this thing dishonest but yes it is bad for the reputation of fellow couponers and the future of couponing but the worst thing is that is says to our lord i dont trust you i dont trust that you will take care of me in this trying economical time and i dont trust that you will provide me with all the things i need and i dont trust you that i can get by if i dont get every single item free or discounted of course the bible says we should trust in the lord with all of our hearts

7624755 hes always been one to rise to the occasion but this was about more than that
7624756 this was his way to maybe help quell a mini revolt among the delegates he likes barack obama and hes worried about the clinton factor hes now going to be the story of this convention at least until obama gives his acceptance speech and this should completely silence whatever dissension exists
7624757 may have accomplished more in the senate than some presidents did in the white house
7624758 i think this is his final hurrah to the party his final gift to the party
7624759 hes the last link to that promising new frontier generation of the 1960s when the world seemed pliable when we were going to make the world a better place when we were going to battle poverty and racism and fight for peace
7624760 i honestly couldnt care less who scarlett johansson is supporting or that she wants to marry barack obama i mean get over yourself and show me your boobs period
7624761 its totally irrelevant what angelina jolie says about who shes voting for isnt going to affect anyone and that very irrelevancy proves that celebrities are just celebrities nothing more and that no one cares what they think even though their narcissism might have them believing otherwise

7624774 worldwide avian flu control efforts have been mostly successful but like seasonal influenza avian flu changes year to year creating new subtypes and strains that could easily and quickly spread among humans
7624775 vlps may be advantageous over other vaccine strategies because they are easy to develop produce and manufacture
7624776 using recombinant technologies within ten weeks we could generate a vaccine most effective towards the current circulating strain of virus making it a cost effective counter measure to the threat of an avian influenza pandemic
7624777 the seamlessness and additional viewing opportunities that todocast provided was absolutely fantastic we are thrilled at the prospect of bringing this event to an even wider audience
7624778 todocast not only made live video streaming possible but enabled a graceful execution of a longtime goal and far exceeded our expectations
7624779 i was very impressed with the todocast system and enjoyed the expertise and support of the todocast crew
7624780 while live video streaming is not a new venture todocast is the first webcasting solution ive seen that takes remote connectivity and onsite technical challenges off the table with todocast you truly can go anywhere shoot anything and in mere moments be connected to a live internet viewing audience
7624781 as the fastest growing manufacturer of remotely operated vehicles and a longtime supporter of the autonomous underwater vehicle competition we were extremely pleased by the whole event the effortless integration functionality and quality of todocast was an unexpected added benefit
7624782 todocast truly provided an unexpected solution and an opportunity for an entirely new audience to participate in the event
7624783 the nature of the practice began to change last year with the opening of memorial hermann sports medicine
7624784 we began to see a large sports medicine practice i think our fellowship is the only one like it in the country
7624785 the huge advantage with this fellowship is the interactive way we work with the team physicians and the athletes
7624786 the most common are hips and shoulders but we also treat a lot of wrists knees and ankles
7624787 with tendon inflammation you have to be very careful to guide the medication to a site close to the tendon without hitting the tendon which could rupture it
7624788 being able to work as a team with the surgeons and the athletes on a daily basis helps us make a more accurate report about the injury leading to less risk less complications and a smaller scar

7625012 dempster said that was worse than pitching in florida during the day it was perfect conditions today the wind kept blowing in a little bit too it was a good day to pitch
7625013 every time he goes out there he gives you a consistent effort
7625014 i think hes had one start where hes given up runs outside of that he goes into the sixth or seventh inning depending on the pitch count and gives you a chance to win a ballgame
7625015 his changeup was down and it seemed like his fastball was overpowering
7625016 you live in a bubble in the village and really have no idea what is happening at home

7625019 i feel the same i always want to beat whichever driver on the track it doesnt matter if its my team mate or not so it doesnt change anything for me
7625020 i always wanted to do my best and i did a lot of good results this season a lot of bad results as well but the mentality is the same
7625021 i dont think it is me who did anything wrong they should have been investigating adrian
7625022 i was the race leader and he was lapped so he should have given way to me anyway
7625023 it was definitely not the weekend i was hoping for but i do not believe that despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title

7625034 elevating the bogus and the petty to cosmic importance is now a tradition in american election coverage
7625035 if the electricity used to charge up an electric car is created by burning fossil fuels is it better to stick with a gas powered car with good fuel economy its true that most electric cars get their electricity from the grid which in many states is made up mostly of electricity from coal fired power plants in areas where the power comes mostly from hydro wind or solar your electric car would be virtually emissions free any electric car owner can achieve this by installing a solar carport at home but we can get at your question in a more precise way the fact is you can make an apples to apples comparison between an electric and a petroleum powered car an electric car doesnt consume gallons of liquid fuel so you cant measure its use of energy in miles per gallon similarly conventional cars dont run on electricity so you cant use miles per kilowatt hour so how do you do it

7625038 as for gaffes and miscues no politician escapes them entirely so if biden still has to answer for purloining the words of a british labor party hopeful in 1987 then perhaps lieberman should be asked to explain why he sucked up to louis farrakhan in 2000 if bidens dumb remark about indian american grocers must be reprinted over and over again then maybe pawlentys broadcast about his wifes reluctance to have sex uttered in her presence last spring will be aired repeatedly too if bidens conflict with catholic bishops over reproductive rights is an issue then surely jindals eerie claim to have exorcised demons and cancer from the body of a female friend deserves a thorough investigation none of those tales is worthy of enormous attention especially during an election that could change america so profoundly but each is just as revealing of character and fitness as anything we have heard about biden over the past few days it is safe to say that had he ever professed his enthusiasm for the works of farrakhan or publicly whined about his wifes sexual withholding or recounted a supernatural adventure the national press corps cable television talk radio and the republican propaganda machine would be churning the stories at top volume elevating the bogus and the petty to cosmic importance is now a tradition in american election coverage and based on the record so far there is no reason to expect improvement in this campaign

7625059 his low rbi totals and lack of power should fit nicely into our lineup
7625060 his batting average recently crept above 260 but we dont anticipate that being an issue once hes got matt holliday he does steal a lot of bases so well have to see what we can do about slowing him down a little then again its hard to steal if youre never on base right

7625065 i stayed in the theater department but focused entirely on musical interpretation and cabaret but i just knew in my mind that i wasnt aiming to be an actress anymore
7625066 i got a clearer sense of my limitations as an actress and as a black actress in particular because the roles for black actresses on broadway are very limited and id been living in a utopia where i thought i could be cast for any part that i wanted just because im good
7625067 im trying to push the boundaries of what soul is
7625068 any black woman doing anything its going to be billed as soul however i didnt necessarily set out to make a soul album theres always something soulful to what i do but what i really set out to do was be as honest as i could and be as true to my influences as i could and put out an album that was eclectic and didnt allow itself to be put in a box i am smart and i want to own that

7625112 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
7625113 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
7625114 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased
7625115 guarantee s a us edge to carry out nuclear war without risking a counter strike
7625116 were at war against determined enemies and we must not rest until that war is won
7625117 stands for freedom around the world now the world must stand for freedom in georgia
7625118 every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
7625119 no one with good intentions towards us and the west should
7625120 moscows willingness to crush georgia with overwhelming force and claims the kremlin has 10 times as many tactical short range warheads as the us
7625121 pugnacious russia determined to acquire economic and military power and not afraid to use threats and force to get its way with nuclear weapons central to the russian geopolitical calculus
7625122 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
7625123 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
7625124 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
7625125 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
7625126 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
7625127 making putin pay and turning russias georgian rout into a political defeat
7625128 to remove president saakasvili from the office to which he was elected in 2004 and to overthrow a democratic government
7625129 western authorities to explore the vulnerability of russian assets abroad or at least make life difficult for the holders of those assets
7625130 in the world of global commerce china calculated that staging an olympic extravaganza could enhance its ambivalent reputation by contrast the putin government seems to believe its power grows in sync with its reputation as an international pariah an outsider state
7625131 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
7625132 russian tanks rolling through georgia with images of chechnya in 1994 and 99 vilnius 91 afghanistan 79 prague 68 hungary 56
7625133 the war in georgia marks an easy return to territorial expansion and attempted regional dominance
7625134 tried to give russians an alternative narrative he put forward democracy as a unifying and legitimizing idea for the new russian state
7625135 young democracies around russia back into moscows sphere of influence the worldview of a russian nationalist is hard for outsiders to comprehend
7625136 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
7625137 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
7625138 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
7625139 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
7625140 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia
7625141 the hegemon in that region and we are not and thats a fact
7625142 any kind of coercive actions like economic sanctions or anything else
7625143 abkhazia rallie d for independence and the abkhazian parliament has approved an official appeal to russia to recognize its independence
7625144 russia is always with you and will never leave you in the lurch
7625145 the kremlin is nearing formal recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia possibly as early as next week
7625146 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
7625147 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
7625148 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
7625149 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia
7625150 in accordance with the international agreements to their previous places of deployment
7625151 envisaged in the international agreement poti is outside of the security zone
7625152 but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
7625153 we have registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
7625154 temporarily suspending military cooperation with nato until a political decision on relations
7625155 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
7625156 local s ossetian and abkhazian population said they fear georgia might repeat its regional aggression they also want russian troops to stay in the area to shield them from any possible attacks

7625169 having the opportunity for him to work with our student athletes and allow them to glean from his experiences at duke as a student athlete and somebody who has pursued the highest level will be excellent for our program
7625170 we are very excited to welcome sarah to our staff
7625171 she has coaching experience at peace college she has so much love and passion for duke really wants to be here and wants to learn from an elite program sarah is a tireless worker and has already shown such great commitment throughout camp this summer

7625176 my administration has lowered taxes supported pro growth policies and enacted an economic stimulus package to encourage small and medium sized business growth
7625177 by keeping more money in the hands of families and small businesses they can save invest spend and give back to their communities our economy is resilient and dynamic because americans are the most industrious creative and enterprising people in the world and because we believe in a free market economy that rewards those qualities
7625178 its up to coach if i dont play thursday night in the preseason finale against the giants ill be ready for kansas city
7625179 featuring sens barbara boxer d ca claire mccaskill d mo and amy klobuchar d mn former gov jane swift r ma and rep hilda solis d ca
7625180 i saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
7625181 our fighters had hopes of winning despite the judges but it was useless they were condemned beforehand
7625182 every discipline every human and material resource that we dedicate to sport
7625183 there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism
7625184 after that tourney i probably would have thought i would have more by now
7625185 all of a sudden youre like seven or eight rows back and theres a really tall guy in front of you waving his hands and screaming
7625186 not going to be as good as the other show
7625187 andy is playing at a time when maybe the greatest player to ever play roger federer is winning everything
7625188 and also the greatest clay court player to ever play rafa nadal is also doing his thing on the dirt and now even on grass and hard were it not for those two andy would have many more grand slams now
7625189 its a weird situation because by no means am i going to complain about anything that ive been blessed with but its almost at this point win another slam or what
7625190 i dont think you can put andy into that category
7625191 thats one thing that really drew me to him was the way he went about his work ethic
7625192 i could probably coast and not train and be a top 10 player and kind of have a cushy lifestyle and be set for as long as i need to be set for
7625193 im happy as i can be away from tennis matches but i dont know if that appeals to me i dont know if im satisfied with that
7625194 its like you want something so bad you almost squeeze too tight
7625195 a lot of guys in todays times look at their success by their bank balance
7625196 andy never did that he wanted his success on the court winning was what he wanted to do more than anything and i can see what he says sometimes hes wound too tight
7625197 andy had success early with big serve and big forehand
7625198 thats great if you have that 1 2 combo but now how many guys have big serves and backhands everybody knows that andys weakness is his backhand i think andy has gotten a little too conservative off the ground
7625199 after the french open people started understanding my game better
7625200 i was a defensive player when i came on tour i was forced to become stronger i was forced to develop an attacking game you can only thread the needle on a passing shot or hit a lob so much
7625201 his dilemma is that he wants to win the semis and finals of big tournaments and he needs more aspects in his game to beat the top players in tough matches
7625202 he has all the tools theres no doubt about that
7625203 to trust the tools that he has and to go out and be willing to put that into the actual match play time after time after time i think thats really the only thing he has to do
7625204 he was playing awfully well in that february may stretch
7625205 unfortunately the injury with my neck had thrown a bit of a wrench into the summer
7625206 its really the first time in my career i have had to deal with any injuries for an extended period of time but i feel like if i can get deep into a tourney i can regain the form from earlier in the year pretty quickly
7625207 i think that roddick can still make a big run at the open
7625208 polska jest idealnym krajem do prowokacji nie trzeba nic wielkiego robi wystarczy by sob a dooko a b dzie wielki kana
7625209 we are eyeball to eyeball and i think the other fellow just blinked
7625210 we dont really live under fear of his nuclear weapons to the extent that he has to live under ours we have nuclear weapons nearby in turkey and places like that
7625211 for tom if we decide to play him then that will be an opportunity for him and if we dont decide to play him or he cant play or whatever it is then it will be an opportunity for someone else
7625212 if certain players dont play then the other players at that position get more of an opportunity to play whatever spot that is
7625213 that is something that matt cassel gutierrez and kevin i think all look for that opportunity to play their position get a chance to perform contribute and show what they can do
7625214 last friday night we saw a little over a half with cassel and less than a half with gutierrez i am sure this week against the giants we will see kevin get a chance to play some and we will figure out what the rest of the playing time is based on everyones availability and so forth
7625215 i thought matt did a good job leading the team with the opportunities he had
7625216 thats my responsibility to try to stay calm and recognize what they are doing and run our offense
7625217 at times we did a decent job at other times we didnt we strung some plays together but the drives still werent perfect there is still a lot of room for improvement we came up short on points so whatever job we did it still wasnt enough
7625218 you always want your leader out there but what if hes not out there week 7
7625219 we are the patriots we have to find a way to win
7625220 it may come out where we may have to be without tom so its up to whoever is in there to execute
7625221 this ceremony signifies that were deploying that weve got a job to do and that were going to get that job done
7625222 ill do what i have to do to support the guys im going out there with the primary goal is to make sure our soldiers come back
7625223 these are the true heroes of this generation who signed up at a time of war to defend the freedom that all americans enjoy and are doing the hard work of executing the desires of our nation and securing our national interests
7625224 im proud of all these soldiers and how they represent the united states theyre ready to go and they want to get down to business and do what their nation asks
7625225 its now time for our soldiers to be with their families before we depart
7625226 the unsung and often unseen heroes are our spouses and family members who did not sign up for the army but who give of themselves so freely and provide the nation with their most precious gift their loved one to defend the nation
7625227 it was a fabulous time its a great day and well continue on to an organizational day as a celebration of all the hard work that weve done and a chance for us to be with our families
7625228 it was nice to see my daddy in the ceremony and go to work with him and have lots of fun
7625229 it was a good opportunity for our families to get together and have a good time and get to know each other it keeps them in the loop so they dont feel so alone when were deployed
7625230 it was good to be able spend time with my husband and beneficial to get to know the family members of the unit and the people that hes going to spend the next 12 months with
7625231 everything in good in the hands of the author of things everything degenerates in the hands of man

7625238 shes also just cool in between takes i found her at the crafts service truck eating grilled cheese and smoking cigarettes talking to the grips
7625239 it was cool hes playing someone whos so immature and when you meet her mary kate she seems really wise and it was also three in the morning and so we were just like ah lets get it over with

7625251 i dont think i ever said bart allen was dead i am serious
7625252 there were stories that were going to be told and there were definite crossovers taking place at the moment of the death of bart allen so there is a good chance there is going to be more resolutions to that character and what happened to him in the very near future or the very far future
7625253 we are going to show you how unique and individual each of those flashes are and what theyre purpose is and what they can all do
7625254 and to reinstate barry allen as the king of the flashes thats what we are out to do
7625255 but no one else can see them its a company perk

7625529 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table

7625533 a man who goes into the swamp by himself asks to die
7625534 i lost half my leg here to the pigs of the swamp
7625535 look at the cuts on me look at my arm bit off those pigs have been free since the revolution eating snakes and digging out roots and fending for themselves for over a hundred years theyre wild and theyre dangerous you cant trap them no man dare go into the swamp by himself
7625536 thank you so much for the warning now could you direct me to the swamp
7625537 sell me ten sacks of corn and help me load it in the wagon
7625538 i need to hire about ten or fifteen wagons i need twenty or thirty men i have six thousand hogs out in the swamp penned up and theyre all hungry ive got to get them to market right away
7625539 i have six thousand hogs penned up they havent eaten for two or three days and theyll starve if i dont get back there to feed and take care of them
7625540 you mean youve captured the wild hogs of the okefenokee
7625541 well the first week i went in there they were wild all right they hid in the undergrowth and wouldnt come out i dared not get off the wagon so i spread corn along behind the wagon every day id spread a sack of corn the old pigs would have nothing to do with it but the younger pigs decided that it was easier to eat free corn than it was to root out roots and catch snakes so the very young began to eat the corn first i did this every day pretty soon even the old pigs decided that it was easier to eat free corn after all they were all free they were not penned up they could run off in any direction they wanted at any time
7625542 the next thing was to get them used to eating in the same place all the time so i selected a clearing and i started putting the corn in the clearing at first they wouldnt come to the clearing it was too far it was too open it was a nuisance to them but the very young decided that it was easier to take the corn in the clearing than it was to root out roots and catch their own snakes and not long thereafter the older pigs also decided that it was easier to come to the clearing every day and so the pigs learned to come to the clearing every day to get their free corn they could still subsidize their diet with roots and snakes and whatever else they wanted after all they were all free they could run in any direction at any time there were no bounds upon them
7625543 the next step was to get them used to fence posts so i put fence posts all the way around the clearing i put them in the underbrush so that they wouldnt get suspicious or upset after all they were just sticks sticking up out of the ground like the trees and the brush the corn was there every day it was easy to walk in between the posts get the corn and walk back out this went on for a week or two shortly they became very used to walking into the clearing getting the free corn and walking back out through the fence posts
7625544 the next step was to put one rail down at the bottom i also left a few openings so that the older fatter pigs could walk through the openings and the younger pigs could easily jump over just one rail after all it was no real threat to their freedom or independence they could always jump over the rail and flee in any direction at any time
7625545 now i decided that i wouldnt feed them every day i began to feed them every other day on the days i didnt feed them the pigs still gathered in the clearing they squealed and they grunted and they begged and pleaded with me to feed them but i only fed them every other day and i put a second rail around the posts
7625546 now the pigs became more and more desperate for food because now they were no longer used to going out and digging their own roots and finding their own food they now needed me they needed my corn every other day
7625547 so i trained them that i would feed them every day if they came in through a gate and i put up a third rail around the fence but it was still no great threat to their freedom because there were several gates and they could run in and out at will
7625548 finally i put up the fourth rail then i closed all the gates but one and i fed them very very well yesterday i closed the last gate and today i need you to help me take these pigs to market
7625549 on a positive note they very very rarely execute people they abduct
7625550 theyre usually held for just a week at a time before theyre released

7625653 i dont know anyone that wouldnt pay 3 to 5
7625654 given that our results are backed by numerous experimental studies showing that incense is a powerful producer of particulate matter and that incense smoke contains carcinogenic substances i believe incense should be used with caution
7625655 that is frequent use in rooms where people live should be minimized or at least sufficient ventilation should be secured in our study we find the increased risk of cancer to be present in individuals reporting frequent use of incense for many years thus repeated exposure for years should probably be avoided
7625656 the american lung association is going to add it as a risk factor
7625657 its not nearly the danger of smoking a pack a day for 20 years but its a danger
7625658 certainly i think bathing yourself in particles is probably not the smartest thing in the world but i think very few people fill up their room with incense
7625659 its a population based study which means that you can make an association but not necessarily a conclusion
7625660 it probably promotes more work in the area of routine household items and things we need to be looking at more prospectively to make a clear cause and effect relationship
7625661 anything that affects air quality negatively is not a good thing
7625662 burning in general and the release of smoke these things are certainly to be avoided at the very least chemical irritants will set off asthma and thats reversible cancer is not reversible
7625663 this is not unlike the type of risk that one experiences from secondhand tobacco smoke
7625664 at the end of the day people who use incense casually i dont think thats a cause for major concern but those cultures which embrace incense as part of their daily lifestyles have to consider this has a real potential risk for cancer
7625665 besides the fact that derek webbs on it sandra mccracken his wife is on it too thats the other reason you should go

7625788 many have discoursed on what an obama victory could mean for america we would finally be able to see our legacy of slavery segregation and racism in the rearview mirror our kids would grow up thinking of prejudice as a nonfactor in their lives the rest of the world would embrace a less fearful and more open post post 9 11 america but does it not follow that an obama defeat would signify the opposite if obama loses our children will grow up thinking of equal opportunity as a myth his defeat would say that when handed a perfect opportunity to put the worst part of our history behind us we chose not to in this event the worlds judgment will be severe and inescapable the united states had its day but in the end couldnt put its own self interest ahead of its crazy irrationality over race

7625860 its tough love i promise what have you been up to
7625861 well we didnt really go to clubs clubs are sort of filled with douchebags
7625862 what clubs are the great equalizer of the city theyre where artists mix with wall streeters you can be at a random place and find yourself doing the bump with madonna or doing a bump with calvin klein
7625863 people dont mix like that anymore and clubs arent safe anymore someone died in bed just a few weeks ago
7625864 no no bed its a club on 27th street instead of tables and chairs they use beds
7625865 how um thematic let me guess it was an overdose overdoses are funny right like funny sad i guess hazard of the lifestyle you know the clubs were always ready for that kind of shit just a block from your bed used to be tunnel and outside was always at least one windowless van sitting with a driver anytime there was an overdose they would sneak the body through the back to one of the exits on 27th street not the main one near the highway but one deeper in the block the one that eventually became the vip entrance and then became the main entrance anyway theyd put the loser into one of the vans outside if the oder was just messy theyd leave them next to a dumpster in the west 30s if they were more messy or a white woman then theyd be dumped off right outside an emergency room usually st vincents
7625866 because the papers would pick up on a missing white woman men especially gays and ethnics they just dont make good headlines anyway at st vincents theyd either wake up or get revived or whatever not remembering how they got where they were and just go home or they could die but that probably never happened not to anyone i ever heard of anyway awesome right
7625867 um i dont know but this wasnt actually an overdose the guy fell down an elevator shaft after a struggle with one of the club employees
7625868 no one of those gigantic bouncers working the door or something
7625869 why would they replace queens with body builders totally the wrong kind of hormone therapy for that kind of job drag queens used to work every threshold at tunnel the queen at the front door could always pick the happy from the crappy the fab from the flawed that kind of editing sort of made it less democratic but it resulted in fun crowds inside even the interior vip area would have another lower grade queen at the door managing all the betties and the toms
7625870 but if you flash cash it shows them that you can buy a bottle and get a table
7625871 are we talking clubs or a mall food court take notes here clubs are for 1 dancing 2 drug use 3 socializing hooking up carousing 4 drug taking and most importantly 5 fabulizing its about spectacle and magic and drama
7625872 but what about impressing people and showing off club goers like receiving reinforcement of how special they are
7625873 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
7625874 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
7625875 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
7625876 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
7625877 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7625878 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7625879 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7625880 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7625881 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention
7625882 tests for perfect pitch have always demanded that subjects already have some musical training or at least familiarity with a particular piece of music which really limits the pool of candidates you can test

7625953 we asked the students teachers to recommend one or two students
7625954 the teachers wrote a paragraph about why their students should come to the camp a panel made decisions based on those recommendations
7625955 unlike a regular class nobody is sleeping everybody is awake and paying attention
7625956 when you look at the senior class they won an overall sec championship four sec west titles the sec tournament title made the ncaa final four final eight and hosted a ncaa regional all four years
7625957 and when you look at it from an academic standpoint we are one of the only teams who have made the academic all american team award which is given to teams with a minimum of a 3 2 overall gpa so these guys have not only been great athletes but students as well
7625958 we talked about how we needed every player to step up a level

7625960 there is no question jonas berg was playing as well as anyone in the country last year and you did not really see a lot from him as far as the individual recognition because he was playing four on the team but he proved to be one of the top players in the nation

7626003 if you believe in the bible you cant be a catholic its a choice you have to make
7626004 i thought it was a good camp i thought our guys worked extremely hard the players the coaches and the staff to put us in a position to get us in our season we were fortunate that not a lot of guys got banged up hopefully that trend can continue were not where we need to be to be the football team were capable of being but probably a lot of coaches in the country feel that way were just going to have to keep working through it were going to be a work in progress and we just have to see how much progress we can make
7626005 we have a senior quarterback so were certainly more apt to throw the ball this year than mikes first year as a starter but as i said before having an experienced quarterback its not just about throwing the ball its about running the offense getting in and out of the right plays we feel more comfortable with that stuff
7626006 kenny britt and ty underwood have played a lot of football for us and they have been very productive the experience they have leads us to feel comfortable there dennis campbell and tim brown are the guys that have done things for us at different times but we need consistency from them they are both electric players but consistency from them is going to be the key i anticipate consistency from them and thats going to give us a lot of depth then we have a bunch of young guys that i think will be able to contribute in their own way
7626007 hes very comfortable in what hes doing look at his stats from last year 63 percent completion rating 15 touchdowns and five interceptions those are all very telling statistics hes mobile to the extent that he can get out of trouble very well they dont ask him to be an option quarterback or a run read quarterback but that doesnt mean theyre not going to because they do have a new offensive coordinator doug nussmeier but that has not been the demands put upon him but when he is under pressure hes got a great feel in the pocket and he can escape
7626008 they lost a really good running back i think hes in the nfl now they have some young backs that will fill in there they played some last year like our backs did but now its their show they have a very good tight end a very good player we are going to have to know where he is at all times they are multiple in their schemes offensively they shift in motion and move a ton they do some unconventional things but make no mistake they are going to bloody your nose and run the football so we better match toughness play for play defensively they have a real good defensive tackle jon monga hes a real disruptive force their middle linebacker is a really good player and then one of their safeties is a really active guy and their corner a j jefferson is a really active guy the defense plays very very hard and their special teams group is extremely good thats going to be an area where the game might be decided and it always can be but they are very good in that area and were young in that area they have a new kick off guy so well see it should be a great opener
7626009 i think were a tough football team but we do need to get tougher we play extremely hard and we are tough but were not as precise as we need to be or as consistent as i want us to be but that goes with the first game
7626010 you only get to play 12 games so no matter who youre opening with youre excited and youre ripping at it ready to go i think there is a little bit extra because we know that this team is something else our best may not be good enough to beat them and thats a fact right now our best might not be good enough to handle them but if we dont play our best we have no chance
7626011 weve known each other hes a very good football coach and a good person hell bring a team here thats ready to play and is tough i see a team there thats similar to us schematically and the way they play
7626012 you talk about balance theyre balanced over 200 from both sides over the course of 13 games thats balanced from knowing pat theyre going to do what he does he was an offensive line coach before he became a head coach so he believes in what he believes what you have to do is try to figure out what the new offensive coordinator doug nussmeier is going to add to that i know that they are going to come and lead up with that fullback and try to smash you and thats what were going to see and they are going to see that from us its the other things the periphery things that you have to be ready for special plays formations different things maybe there will be option maybe gun zone we prepare for it anyway in the preseason and even if they havent shown a lot of it you know something different will show its head
7626013 as a defensive coach you are worried about every offense whether they have the 119 th ranked stats or the top ranked stats because defense in and of itself is kind of a negative if they gain one yard youre in the hole so what you try to do is cut your losses you try to defend this group is certainly potent its going to take every ounce of what we have to have a chance to win
7626014 obviously the twins are our guys at corner then we have some really good young defensive backs playing behind them brandon bing is going to be very good the guy who is a steadying factor back there is an older guy in billy anderson all billy does is do everything right so hes going to play then you look at the young guys brandon jones is a good football player he and david rowe may get on the field so there are some young guys who can run and who can play theyre just inexperienced
7626015 were building that as we go i think charlie noonan had his best period of play over this camp he continues to get better blair bines is getting ready but hes going to be forced to play maybe before hes ready to play but thats the way it goes i think were ok at the ends we have jon freeny and gary watts its the inside where you wonder what its going to be
7626016 with the linebackers i knew they would play hard last year and now i think now they are more experienced and i think they are more comfortable which makes me feel more comfortable i think we were productive last year you look at malasts stats he was our leading tackler but i think were going to play better i think that our linebackers will play more consistently
7626017 im not concerned because i think well be able to run the ball but until we do i cant be sure well have to wait and see on monday line up against someone else and run the football i wont be concerned with it until something makes me concerned
7626018 i think mason robinson and kordell young are going to be the first two guys not necessarily in any order just see what plays were running our offensive coaches do a good job of knowing this is what he does best and this is what he does best and then try to fit that so well do that today and tomorrow really hone in on which runs are for whom and then go from there
7626019 i think they can run outside but i think they can run inside as well they both have a good sense of inside running i think it will be a mix and i think it may even be a better mix than it was because we are more capable of going outside
7626020 i think these young guys will be good caleb ruch has never played in a college football game so fresno state will be his first and that will be interesting i believe hes ready hes worked very hard to get himself ready to understand what it is to play every down on a division i level now thats in practice so now he has to do it in a game howard barbieri has established himself as someone we can count on kevin haslam i believe will be back and will be ok from a health standpoint i think anthony davis will be ok so i think well have our top six guys ready to go and if we have to go deeper than that well have to do some shuffling of the deck
7626021 were going to find out how good they are you have two guys who are in nfl training camps right now and mike fladell who should be in camp in my opinion thats pretty hard to replace im sure in teels mind hes confident in his offensive line but lets see you do it teel cant worry about that he has to do his job and trust that they will do theirs but those are the unknowns so until you see them do it how do you know
7626022 hes getting there alex is another young guy and going down inside is another world you have to learn and alex is getting better every day jamaal westerman could always go back there but i just felt that here was a guy who had played a position for four years now and i wanted to see how hed do down there and hed be fine but i would rather not disrupt two positions
7626023 im just too busy so i really just dont have time to watch nfl games i just found out jeremy zuttah started a game the other night pedro sosa is in a camp now i just found that out yesterday and thats great i root for them but were so busy and they send us texts about what theyre up to but i havent really watched any pro football i watched maybe 10 plays of the browns giants game and thats it but it is exciting when we got here we said eventually that line is going to start flowing to the nfl and once it does it wont stop thats what is happening thats for sure you look at this group of seniors now there are going to be many of them playing in the nfl and thats what good programs do
7626024 could be good and could be bad could be good because for kids at that age the level of player that these guys are the nfl is it anything they see they talk about it they love it they just have to be sure that they understand that theres good and theres bad dont wish away time because theres nothing like your college football experience that i can tell them ive been in both sides and i think the nfl guys have told them that this is it the next one is a job this is it
7626025 i thought they played well right now the starting three are manny abreu ryan dimperio and kevin malast damaso has gotten a lot better this year as has ryan so damaso munoz is going to play some jim dumont has played his way into the two deep antonio lowery is in the two deep which is good for him so not only are the first three guys doing well but i think the backups are too
7626026 in college football you dont have preseason games so everything is right off the bat we have a lot of situations where have to face some of the best right off the bat so we better be ready i dont know if our best is good enough but anything less were not going to have a chance there are guys on this team who have never played in games so we dont know how they are going to respond we have new coaches that have not coached together in a real game so we tried using headsets during scrimmages but the pressures of a real game are definitely different than anything you can create in practice
7626027 its great to have courtney greene and the twins back there as long as theyve been playing they help us we discuss ideas with them ask them if they think this can work or that can work it reminds me of working in the nfl going back and forth with guys if you have a young guy it really doesnt do much to ask him because he really doesnt know what problems are out there he might tell you what he likes but he doesnt know how its going to fly guys like courtney and the twins theyve played a lot of football so they know they come back and say coach remember when we did this that happened and thats great
7626028 thats the best of those two guys zaire kitchen and joe lefeged each day we were alternating who was with the first team and i never realized i had to ask coach pinkham who was out there at safety because each one of them did a great job and i feel very comfortable with both we want to make sure both of them play because theres no reason that one of them should be tired when we have another on the sideline
7626029 i think we have a team that will punish you especially a guy like george johnson hes a guy that has put some hits on people this training camp where i was worried they werent getting up
7626030 i think its great to be on national television if you win some games youll get on television and if you dont win you wont be on television our job is to make sure that we keep winning and television will take care of itself but it is great they have ucla and tennessee after us so thats a great afternoon and evening of football
7626031 hes working there but im not sure hes the best punt returner so thats why we wouldnt have him in there if hes the best then we may be careful because if hes gassed or tired we wouldnt want him out there but if hes the best and that gives us the best chance to win then that play is just as important to me as him running a takeoff route
7626032 i think our leadership does that more than we do when were out there playing we try to communicate on defense weve told them that they are at home this week so the good news is that the opposing offense cant hear themselves but the bad news is that we cant hear ourselves either so when youre making checks and changing the defensive coverages you have to do hand signals you have to be loud you have to communicate and not many high school players have to deal with a game where they cant even hear themselves talking we try to give them experience with crowd noise and making the crowd noise deafening so that they have to communicate via hand signals all that is fine but then you throw that one variable of the pressure to perform in a game and you dont always know how its going to go thats why weird things happen in games
7626033 you havent played a game in so long you play the first one then bang 10 days later youre playing another one and then six days later another game so the key i think is to treat every game like the first game of the season approach it with that kind of enthusiasm and newness so we will work on that its not a problem for the actual first game its when you get into the year and youre banged up and the game is coming too fast for you then you have to have that kind of attitude

7626057 we demand so much from our avid ds systems over the course of a week we may be asked to work on a wide range of projects from pal trailers to episodic television and effects work to 4 4 4 features that will be filmed out
7626058 weve been beta testing the new version of avid ds for a few months here on a variety of different projects we are very impressed with the performance improvements color management capabilities and the addition of the advanced color correction tools with secondaries having all those effects in real time in 4 4 4 is a tremendous timesaver our clients expect speed accuracy and style regardless of the type of project or how tight the deadline avid ds 10 is the perfect platform allowing us to continue meeting these needs for our clients
7626059 without question the avid ds system offers the highest quality integrated toolset for the online editorial process
7626060 the new real time secondary color correction feature is excellent and our clients love the grades we are able to add to their final product overall there are just loads of little extras and improvements that i keep stumbling upon which are huge timesavers and just another example of how avid has been really listening to the user base
7626061 we could not believe it when we saw the shore
7626062 it was one small step for humankind and one giant step for palestine
7626063 the 44 activists had set sail from cyprus on friday aiming to defy an israeli blockade of the impoverished territory of 1 5 million people which was tightened when the islamist hamas movement seized power in june 2007
7626064 the activists had expected to be stopped by israel which had warned them to stay out of gazas coastal waters but on saturday israel decided to allow them through without incident in order to avoid a public standoff
7626065 hes an outstanding leader and somebody who would better represent the mainstream of the country
7626066 the u s military must remain apolitical at all times and in all ways
7626067 its an all girls day maybe we can get the boys sick on monday too
7626068 the thirties are a time when you grow into your own skin
7626069 over the past few years many have had much to say about our efforts to bring faith to the democratic party
7626070 we believe we are created equal and each one of us deserves the opportunity to live full and prosperous lives
7626071 today is a celebration of our faith and our values the best tradition of the democratic party today we respect our differences while striving to find our commonalities it remains true that there s more that unites us than divides us
7626072 surely we cannot be pleased with the routine administration of millions of surgically terminated pregnancies something in us must be calling for a better way we know that our party will acknowledge the moral and spiritual pain because of this disregard for the unborn those of us who support the democratic party support it because the democratic party supports more of the positions that are relevant to the lives of our people the people of america in general and the people in the world others loudly proclaim their advocacy for the unborn but they refuse to recognize their responsibility and the responsibility of our nation to those who are born standing ovation senator obama and all of us should follow up and elaborate on his stated intention to reduce the number of abortions interrupted by clapping we should support him in this endeavor
7626073 its not mainly about doing the right thing or being ethical its mainly about salvation its mainly about getting your butt saved when you die and thats why i think theyre less moral than ethicists
7626074 a hero is part human and part supernatural a hero is born out of a childhood trauma or out of a disaster that must be avenged

7626078 jill stanek an anti abortion blogger with a nationwide following says
7626079 said jill stanek a nurse in the chicago area who writes an anti abortion blog
7626080 jill stanek an illinois nurse and anti abortion activist wrote on her web site
7626081 it wasnt until i took some time off recently that i realised how to get things into perspective i actually need eight hours sleep
7626082 to me the best facelift is a great smile and a good nights sleep
7626083 best budget buy plenty of good sleep and water always pays off
7626084 sleep is the new sex and bedrooms are the new design and lifestyle focal point the emphasis is on the quality of sleep
7626085 we suspect that chronic sleep loss may not only hasten the onset but also increase the severity of age related ailments such as diabetes hypertension obesity and memory loss the metabolic changes resulting from sleep debt mimic many of the hallmarks of ageing
7626086 theres now very robust evidence to show that if you deprive yourself of sleep your performance at work gets worse your personality deteriorates and your brain function diminishes
7626087 sleep is 3rd in our hierarchy of biological needs after air and water
7626088 in the face of the plethora of supplements widely available it is important to make sure that you are taking the ones which are energetically right for you simple non invasive tests can measure the effects on each individual while traditional oriental healthcare by assessing your inherent strengths and weaknesses can be utilised to ascertain which dietary changes may be necessary

7626090 it is so well protected no one can get inside
7626091 a golf cart finally got us in here we have this van with special plates couldnt get in a very very go getter young lady saw us recognized me and said ill get you in and she did i dont know what was going on but we were waiting and waiting on a long line that wasnt moving until she came along
7626092 denvers a nice city but id rather be in new york
7626093 wait theres a difference between the people at this convention and the people out in the public the people out in this convention many of whom like myself were hillary delegates 99 are for obama and 95 are strongly for obama because they know whats at stake
7626094 are there a few people who feel so angry about what happened with hillary that they now say they cant support obama yes but its such a small number and unfortunately the media interview them because theyre an interesting story but they dont represent the delegates here
7626095 you have a different issue and that is there are a good number of people who voted for hillary in the democratic primary in southeast ohio western pennsylvania or other places who dont really know obama yet and that is the job of this convention and this campaign and i believe when they get to know obama and compare him to john mccain 95 96 of hillary supporters who voted for hillary in the primary will vote for obama
7626096 as somebody who runs campaigns it is a bad idea to use somebody whos not on your sides words because theyll turn it around in a minute we never do it at the dscc its a bad idea because hillary can just rebut it personally and itll just blow the commercial away thats what she did today
7626097 it never works it never works its a bad strategy
7626098 giulianis worldview is like mccains worldview on foreign affairs its to the right of george bush i respect that view but thats not where americas at i dont think he persuades undecided voters i like giuliani i just dont think he persuades them because his basic view is more foreign military intervention thats not where americas at
7626099 there is no way because the pro life people will do their own candidacy theyre dubious enough of mccain on this issue and that will mean 400 electoral votes for obama
7626100 look mccain cant win on domestic policy he cant win on the economy he cant win on foreign policy so all he does is attack and its not going to prevail not when the people are need of help
7626101 i think the russian government understands the limited capabilities of this system
7626102 we have had unprecedented discussions that have explained the technical capabilities of the system i think on the face of it they understand 10 interceptors in poland would have no impact on the russians strategic offensive forces
7626103 the patriot battery in question will be a u s army patriot battery so that it will be owned and operated by the united states army
7626104 what we have said to the russians is that this is not a system which is aimed at russia but rather is aimed at the growing threats we see from places like the middle east
7626105 i was a little worried about the leg on that jump but it felt okay im at about 93 percent
7626106 we just worked some things we were trying to correct
7626107 had a certain network not blown our cover at a certain time the text message would have gone out in the morning 8 a m eastern
7626108 gotta say this whole vp annc by text mssg thing seems to have been botched
7626109 should have anticipated the msm would get story if it delayed annc as long as it did
7626110 the campaign appeared to have largely pulled off the feat
7626111 being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7626112 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god
7626113 when 2006 came upon us and we saw a new majority in the house and senate it made a difference imagine sitting in the house chamber watch the historic vote on the matthew shepard act and then looking up into the gallery and seeing judy shepard thats the kind of difference an election can make
7626114 as we debated on the house floor and struggle to pass an inclusive enda we did it under the shadow of veto threats but were going to love president obamas statements of policy
7626115 in 1980 we wrote the first suggestion of gay americans in our platform it said all groups must be protected from discrimination based on race age religion gender and sexual discrimination
7626116 in 2000 we added support of enda and gay families
7626117 but this year weve taken even bolder steps including protections based on discrimination on gender identity adn talking about same sex families in the same breath as talking about all american families

7626127 if we appear solid and capable but still get knocked out then everyone is happy and we can still be home by the end of wimbledon come on tiger tim
7626128 b ecause some men arent looking for anything logical like money they cant be bought bullied reasoned or negotiated with some men just want to watch the world burn
7626129 we realise that to earn more millions we need to get more people into that new ground we think big so we want it twice as big and im talking real fans hard working executives who take time off from their gruelling jet set wealth making schedules to assertively gulp down dom perignon and eat lobster with their cronies none of your fly by night prawn sandwich brigade milquetoast family men who might miss a match if their kids are sick or pathetically skint teenagers
7626130 underground executive boxes you wont see any live action but at least youll get away from the ground fast before the end of a turgid nil nil in midwinter

7626134 a manager cant be expected to be great all the time
7626135 work life balance is all important and you need time to unwind lying chilling with your mates in a tv studio you know i really miss rambling on in front of a camera during international tournaments its not the same rambling on in the dressing room no one seems to listen to me there
7626136 the artist formerly known as king kevin is a maverick genius he doesnt have plans he has grand visions
7626137 ha a normal mortal might write down a list of things they need to do but kevin keeps it all in his head you dont want ideas like his to fall into the wrong hands
7626138 kevin quite rightly in my opinion sees reality as just a thin veneer strip away this surface and underneath you get loads of pulsating numbers and equations kevin has collected some secret magic numbers to help the players perform but they are secret
7626139 the man who gets the most satisfactory results is not always the man with the most brilliant single mind but rather the man who can best coordinate the brains and talents of his associates

7626149 okay its obvious dumb and dumber are here unaccompanied and im fairly positive that im not the only one that notices them riding through the store why hasnt the manager come out and aked them to leave
7626150 that intricate detail on the side of the building it had to be of historical significance

7626156 i was kind of scared i wasnt going to stay in the school to get blown up
7626157 but once they said it was a hoax and they knew where the threat came from a felt a little bit better about it
7626158 if we get them involved in something here besides academics we tend to keep them in school
7626159 they are in love and this news makes things even better

7626164 if griffin does not like immigration why is he an englishman living in welsh land
7626165 the free trade ideology is blinding people to the fact that britain has now become a nation that no longer produces for itself
7626166 i am asking you to those of you who supported me i will be forever grateful to work as hard for barack obama as you worked for me during the primary
7626167 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumour of controversy than the fact of unity
7626168 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so
7626169 senator and president clinton fully support the obama biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this fall

7626177 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp
7626178 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7626179 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp there were many casualties up to now we have 27 confirmed dead and 75 wounded
7626180 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7626181 we called off regular patrols in kalma because it is not part of our mandate to search for arms and arrest individuals
7626182 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7626183 a unamid police and military force accessed the camp and we are prepared for possible assistance in the case of evacuating any type of casualties

7626186 barack obama is a pro abortion radical so theres nothing surprising about his choosing a pro abortion running mate
7626187 neither senator obama nor senator biden seems to have taken catholic arguments about the first principles of justice seriously
7626188 the churchs pro life position is not sectarian it can be engaged by anyone willing to work through a serious philosophical argument
7626189 neither obama nor biden seems willing to do that which casts a rather large shadow over their claims to be the ticket of thoughtfulness and intellectual seriousness
7626190 catholics for obama tying themselves into even tighter theological pretzels as they try to justify a vote for what seems likely to be the most radically pro abortion ticket in american history
7626191 an affable veteran politician who is unlikely to repeat the 2004 mistakes of sen john kerry by overselling his catholic credentials
7626192 a wake up call to the church clergy and laity alike
7626193 improve the way we hand on the faith be willing to exercise the spiritual work of mercy of admonishing the sinner and to keep politically active so that such people are voted out of office
7626194 if a politician cannot respect the life of a little baby how is he supposed to respect yours and mine
7626195 the democrats are slapping faithful catholics right in the face first they will nominate the most pro abortion candidate in history then they refuse to invite the beloved archbishop of denver even to offer a prayer at their convention and now they nominate a pro abortion catholic as vice president only self hating catholics could vote for this ticket
7626196 the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7626197 bidens own bishop bishop michael saltarelli of wilmington del has said that the issues pertaining to the sanctity of human life are the great civil rights issues of this generation
7626198 their caucuses are likely to be less progressive as they pick up seats in very conservative formerly republican districts

7626204 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement
7626205 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7626206 what i understand is that the iraqi parliament will not pass this agreement
7626207 at this moment the iraqi government and parliament are not ready for such a deal which will face a lot of hurdles
7626208 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and national interests of iraq
7626209 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and we cannot grant full immunity
7626210 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament

7626232 this is incredibly dramatic for a global perception of china and also for chinas self perception that it can handle something on this scale
7626233 its a kind of financial coming of age itll be an important marker probably in a positive direction as far as we can tell at the moment
7626234 that aggrieved nationalism was the dominant narrative for half a century so the chinese communist party staked its own legitimacy on overcoming all this humiliation
7626235 now china has stood up in the world its clear for everybody to see this offers china a chance to bury this aggrieved baggage theyve carried with them and stand more confidently in the world
7626236 this is not only for sportsmen and women to prove something its for the nation to prove something
7626237 this is a prosperous nation people are doing well and thats more important than simply winning medals from the games
7626238 i spoke to one western guy he said before for him his image of china was 1989 the crackdown now its the birds nest
7626239 i think the government could have taken this as a good opportunity to address the real issues to crack down on corruption to improve the rule of law to open up the media to provide more channels for people to express their grievances
7626240 but instead to absolutely guarantee the smooth operations the government tries to hide the problem and takes excessive measures
7626241 government has to do something to improve chinese soccer skills
7626242 to do that they have to take care of widespread corruption hold officials responsible for failure follow the rule of law in that category i think sports could trigger revolution not radical revolution but piece by piece

7626248 but i dont agree about reading his book if people are going to vote wisely they need to understand whats at stake
7626249 i expect youll see a lot of editorial excitement from us on that book
7626250 in this world of celebrity blogs and entertainment gossip television we are intensely aware of public figures who perform the same function as mythological figures did in an earlier period
7626251 when i first started to read it i thought oh it was going to be a hatchet job but i enjoyed it anyway i was amazed with what she could do with so few pages at the beginning

7626318 it has been a tough day i had to make a very difficult decision something very positive has come up late in my career and i cannot turn it down

7626320 the dollar wants to pull oil lower and the storm wants to pull it higher its a bit of a tug of war right now
7626321 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7626322 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7626323 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7626324 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7626325 the united nations urges restraint and calls for the immediate establishment of a humanitarian corridor so that the injured may be evacuated
7626326 severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection under international humanitarian law
7626327 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp
7626328 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7626329 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp we have 27 confirmed dead including five women and two children
7626330 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7626331 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7626332 our people are inside kalma we are taking a leading role in coordinating organising a convoy of the wounded negotiating with the government and working to ensure a positive outcome to this crisis
7626333 we are in contact with all the parties to find a lasting solution
7626334 we continue at this point to believe that this was a legitimate strike against the taliban
7626335 the presence of the international community in afghanistan must be reviewed through a mutual agreement
7626336 the authorities and responsibilities of the international forces in afghanistan must be regulated through a status of force agreement consistent with both international and afghan laws
7626337 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians must be stopped
7626338 is in afghanistan on the basis of a united nations mandate and has been invited there by the government of afghanistan
7626339 unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7626340 these areas are host to some of the worlds most bio diverse
7626341 we started off pretty well but caught a little transition in the middle of the game and the ball started to do some sporadic things down the lane
7626342 hoff just didnt have a very good look on that pair
7626343 we gave them a good scare toward the end japan bowled really well and got us by a stick that happens sometimes
7626344 we probably were the underdogs going in everybody beat us by at least 100 on the short
7626345 walter struggled on the short the whole time which i know is hard to fathom we didnt have great ball reaction and we havent matched up on these patterns we grinded our way through to qualify for a medal though
7626346 the running game i think thats another area that we have to improve
7626347 there were some runs that i was really pleased with and then some other runs that we didnt quite get what we wanted
7626348 whenever you cant run the ball the line isnt doing its part
7626349 we have to get better as a front five and make more room for the backs you make your landmarks and get your guys blocked up better to make the holes a little clearer for the backs
7626350 i should be pressing the holes a lot longer than ive been doing lately
7626351 im making the cutbacks too soon and im not even a cutback runner its a matter of us not being disciplined enough
7626352 we can better our courses in approaching the line and better our reads its a collective thing
7626353 in the passing game i can miss a block and the quarterback can still get the ball off
7626354 in the running game you have to have all 11 guys doing everything right on a particular play for the runner to go far getting everybody sync ed up often takes time

7626374 post the day biden was selected he knows the candidate that candidate the one that you arent supposed to listen to
7626375 ill say straight up that john mccain is genuinely a friend of mine
7626376 you cant change america when you supported george bushs policy 95 percent of the time
7626377 you cant change america and end the war in iraq and say these are his words no one has supported president bush more than i have
7626378 you cant change america you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of bushs presidency
7626379 a task for mr biden the advisers said will be to doggedly portray the presumptive republican nominee senator john mccain of arizona as a handmaiden for president bush who would continue his policies in the words of one adviser mr biden can be an artful critic because he knows chapter and verse about mr mccains senate votes and controversial positions after serving with him for two decades
7626380 last week u s and iraqi officials said the two sides had agreed tentatively to a schedule which included a broad pullout of combat forces by the end of 2011 with a residual u s force remaining behind to continue training and advising the iraqi security forces

7626391 the worst thing is when friends say remember the good old days forget about the good old days that just makes your present second hand what is interesting is now if you think it was better before then you might as well commit suicide immediately
7626392 often things arent that important im not that important either i dont take myself too seriously
7626393 im in a permanent bad mood with myself thinking i could always do better that there is more its like there is this glass wall and i cant get through to the other side
7626394 im not one of those people who think theyre more artistic than their profession come on youre selling things that make people happy not difficult pregnancies i cant stand designers who talk about their work being art

7626409 i will bring a lifetime of experience and sen obama will bring a speech that he gave in 2002
7626410 will you let me talk to you some time before you take off on some of these wild tangents you get off on
7626411 and mccain said i probably should do that anyway youve got it
7626412 so im giving you the word i got from john mccain if he gets a little bit too far out of line he owes me a call and i can come back and say john dont do that
7626413 im passionate but you dont have to get mad you dont have to blow a gasket
7626414 john used to harass me because i would get earmarks or pork barrel projects in
7626415 and i would say well yes john im a senator from and were the poorest state in the nation but were not anymore that pork paid off
7626416 but you know what in my heart i knew he was right thats no way to do business we shouldnt be doing all that earmarking it got completely out of control it got out of control with republicans and thats why we are being punished a little bit because we forgot how we got there what we believed in the principles that after 30 years put us in the majority gave us the white house the congress the senate the house
7626417 the idea is that people are less likely to just throw it away if theres someome there

7626420 im human i love attention actors dont go onstage because they dont want attention if you show your art if you show your fashion thats also a very human thing and in terms of contemporary life and the twenty first century fascination with personalities i like that i get out of that fashion designer box and become i dont know personality box or celebrity box i love that its fun
7626421 there is nothing he loves more than seeing his work woven into the culture jacobs also enjoys the idea that the brand is the product being sold

7626423 certainly we made mistakes and unfortunately we were impacted by factors beyond our control including the current economic environment and state of the travel industry we came close to realizing a different outcome for our venture but as the saying goes close doesnt count at the end of the day despite a well received market leading product and early success with strategic partners such as orbitz and alaska airlines we simply ran out of money to continue executing on our vision

7626432 are working on a deal to give her some votes in the roll call for the democratic presidential nomination but quickly end the divided balloting in unanimous consent for obama
7626433 t he idea is that at the start of the state by state vote for the presidential nomination wednesday night delegates would cast their votes for clinton or obama
7626434 but the voting would be cut off after a couple of states the officials said perhaps ending with new york when clinton herself would call for unanimous backing for obama from the convention floor

7626441 today s options for acne sufferers are either remarkably outdated such as benzoyl peroxide which has been around since the 1930s or expensive like clinical phototherapy which can cost thousands of dollars
7626442 ansr acne care is a technological advancement in acne treatment that has already changed people s lives who never thought they would be able to afford having clear skin
7626443 dermatologists at leading research institutions have long touted the benefits of clinical phototherapy for treating acne
7626444 ansr acne care offers acne sufferers an effective in home solution that leverages the benefits of both red and blue light therapy and looks to be a significant improvement in acne treatment that s safe without any side effects
7626445 finding a solution that really works to treat acne can be difficult and frustrating
7626446 ansr is unique because it s an acne treatment that capitalizes on the latest technological advances in phototherapy and complements it with specially formulated lotions together they kill acne causing bacteria thin pore clogging sebum and reduce the redness in the areas affected by acne ansr acne care appears to be a paradigm shift in the treatment of acne
7626447 before ansr i tried everything creams antibiotics you name it anything my mom and i read about i tried
7626448 but nothing treated my acne and helped my skin look smoother or healthier like ansr did i am honestly a new person
7626449 like most acne sufferers before i found ansr i was desperate to try anything that would clear up my skin
7626450 unfortunately medications like accutane come with the risk of severe side effects i love how ansr not only treated my acne but for the first time my skin is clear smooth and glowing
7626451 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement
7626452 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7626453 what i understand is that the iraqi parliament will not pass this agreement
7626454 at this moment the iraqi government and parliament are not ready for such a deal which will face a lot of hurdles
7626455 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and national interests of iraq
7626456 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and we cannot grant full immunity
7626457 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament

7626462 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
7626463 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
7626464 part of her appeal was her success in dealing with an often hostile republican led legislature said allan cigler political science professor at the university of kansas although many sebelius proposals have gone nowhere she has managed to get her way a surprising number of times for a kansas democrat
7626465 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
7626466 the goal is to defeat obama i dont want obama to be in office

7626471 why dont you put a different name on your resume
7626472 if they dont want sufiya abdur rahman then they dont want me
7626473 it is worth pursuing every disparate field of knowledge precisely because the fields were not disparate but branches of knowledge intimately connected to one another
7626474 i know him not as a politician but as a husband and a father and a man and i want to talk about that and why i think hell be an extraordinary president
7626475 our story is the great american story of success and pulling yourself up
7626476 i dont know a woman on this planet who isnt a little bit concerned right now about the direction of this country
7626477 my life isnt following that tough trajectory because weve been fortunate but i know those struggles so clearly and those struggles are universal they defy race and party and religion
7626478 theyll understand that barack gets these struggles in a way that his opponent doesnt get
7626479 throughout my life i have not paid much attention about what people say about me who dont know me
7626480 but i dont let that define me i have been the same person that i was when i started along this journey with barack
7626481 i dont hear people asking me whether im angry or not
7626482 they want to know what barack is going to do to put this country on the right track
7626483 folks are not doing this because theyre cynical or believe that barack is a cynical candidate
7626484 i know his plans and policies and theres nothing cynical about it
7626485 i want people to understand who we are as a family what our values are
7626486 the republican party has done a great job of painting themselves as the only party that will offer a conservative christian candidate out there
7626487 but with my candidacy the democrats are doing that and its a challenge the republican party hasnt had in this district in 44 plus years
7626488 the national democratic party they realize that if theyre going to make any inroads if theyre going to pierce that conservative republican veil that has control of the deep heart of the south theyre going to have to recruit and support people with my beliefs southern democrats conservative democrats
7626489 were all cut of the same ilk george wallace was probably right not a dimes bit a difference at this level
7626490 2008 is going to be a watershed election in the south
7626491 democrats have wised up theres no question about that theyre running better races now than ive seen them run before
7626492 im jay love im running for congress because i want to make sure its conservative christian change
7626493 i think he will show his true colors once hes elected or if hes elected to congress
7626494 we had southern democrats who came across as very conservative never would have been challenged on family issues or traditional issues
7626495 and thats the way these new democratic candidates are aligning themselves
7626496 as far as bobby bright the man if anybody can change me he might do it ill be honest with you
7626497 i think hes very conservative and has all the values that all us republicans like to hold true to and thats what turned the south republican those values
7626498 i think having sen mccain running for president sen sessions running for re election jay love the next one down as opposed to barack obama whose views are out of touch with the average alabamian bobby bright is going to have to defend why he wants to run on that ticket
7626499 this is incredibly dramatic for a global perception of china and also for chinas self perception that it can handle something on this scale
7626500 its a kind of financial coming of age itll be an important marker probably in a positive direction as far as we can tell at the moment
7626501 that aggrieved nationalism was the dominant narrative for half a century so the chinese communist party staked its own legitimacy on overcoming all this humiliation
7626502 now china has stood up in the world its clear for everybody to see this offers china a chance to bury this aggrieved baggage theyve carried with them and stand more confidently in the world
7626503 this is not only for sportsmen and women to prove something its for the nation to prove something
7626504 this is a prosperous nation people are doing well and thats more important than simply winning medals from the games
7626505 i spoke to one western guy he said before for him his image of china was 1989 the crackdown now its the birds nest
7626506 i think the government could have taken this as a good opportunity to address the real issues to crack down on corruption to improve the rule of law to open up the media to provide more channels for people to express their grievances
7626507 but instead to absolutely guarantee the smooth operations the government tries to hide the problem and takes excessive measures
7626508 government has to do something to improve chinese soccer skills
7626509 to do that they have to take care of widespread corruption hold officials responsible for failure follow the rule of law in that category i think sports could trigger revolution not radical revolution but piece by piece

7626511 o campeonato est chegando num momento importante e a gente precisa mostrar que veio para ficar fora de casa precisamos ter a mesma postura de quando atuamos em casa nosso aproveitamento supera os 90 aqui dentro e isso postura de time que quer brigar pelo t tulo tem que ser assim independente do local de jogo
7626512 esse o grande diferencial do campeonato brasileiro analisando todas as rodadas at aqui voc v que s houve uma em que venceram mais visitantes do que mandantes no resto a vantagem foi de quem jogou em casa o gr mio tem vantagem porque venceu cinco vezes fora de casa outras equipes venceram tr s e n s conseguimos dois placares positivos

7626737 the united nations urges restraint and calls for the immediate establishment of a humanitarian corridor so that the injured may be evacuated

7626739 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp
7626740 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7626741 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp there were many casualties up to now we have 27 confirmed dead and 75 wounded
7626742 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7626743 we called off regular patrols in kalma because it is not part of our mandate to search for arms and arrest individuals
7626744 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7626745 a unamid police and military force accessed the camp and we are prepared for possible assistance in the case of evacuating any type of casualties
7626746 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement
7626747 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7626748 what i understand is that the iraqi parliament will not pass this agreement
7626749 at this moment the iraqi government and parliament are not ready for such a deal which will face a lot of hurdles
7626750 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and national interests of iraq
7626751 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and we cannot grant full immunity
7626752 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament
7626753 russia needs to respect the territorial independence and sovereignty of georgia
7626754 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia relations cannot be returned to their former state
7626755 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7626756 we would like these relations to be comprehensive and in the spirit of partnership
7626757 but if they in effect tear up that cooperation then nothing terrible will happen to us
7626758 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7626759 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement

7626837 canadians are traditionally peacekeepers and so for us to lose that many its hard
7626838 its a great outpouring of support by ordinary canadians none of this was orchestrated by the government or by the town or anything like that its just people that want to come out and pay their respects
7626839 its too bad we didnt have more politicians here that might be less willing to send them over there
7626840 holding the olympics was good in terms of china taking a more democratic path we believe this is an irreversible path
7626841 while the reformist open door policy is said to be making progress in china it is not always leaping forward
7626842 i think our friends in china have hosted a highly successful
7626843 lets remember that these games have been free of violence and this is a very uncertain world that we live in
7626844 i dont know of a single olympic games in recent history which has not generated controversy of one sort or another
7626845 when the chinese leadership sees the system questioned it does not respect basic freedoms as we know them that is why i am strictly against saying it is all good
7626846 the city has opened up and people are mixing like they did in moscow when i was there in 1980
7626847 it was maybe an opportunity missed for the chinese to demonstrate their willingness to be more open and to allow more
7626848 the chinese authorities and the ioc had an opportunity to demonstrate but in most respects they failed to deliver
7626849 forced evictions detention of activists and restrictions on journalists should not blight another olympics
7626850 the games was a historic climax of three decades of china opening to the world
7626851 drop 10 grenades sing serenades we in the streets swinging blades
7626852 im like whos one of the most beautiful artists it must be alicia keys and i aint talking her physical features but the way she sings
7626853 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7626854 as games close with pageantry u s and chinese teams can smile over successes
7626855 raddled sweat drenched face of led zeppelin lead guitarist jimmy page
7626856 have put an end once and for all to the notion that these olympics are a force for good
7626857 unique opportunity for the chinese people to demonstrate the progress they have made and their sincere desire to engage with the world at every level
7626858 whatever game plan mugabe had has been complicated and this greatly diminishes his capacity to form a cabinet and govern
7626859 mugabe is seriously weakened and he and zanu pf will have to take the negotiations more seriously
7626860 this is highly significant because it means zanu pf have lost the legislative control of parliament it shows there is a determination throughout the opposition that there should not be any two party arrangement with zanu pf and it will force president mbeki to take morgan tsvangirais concerns more seriously
7626861 you sit on that side you are now in the opposition
7626862 this is a truly historic event and i would like on behalf of the president our party and this side of this august house to congratulate you
7626863 help me out here madame speaker when does life begin

7626866 we put our hands with the american hands to get rid of these people

7626869 he was in the wrong place at the wrong time
7626870 he left at that time to meet that fate we believe that everything that happens is the voice of god
7626871 this is an accident that could happen to any iraqi living in this country today
7626872 directing your emotion where it changes something the civilian authority process which gives the mission to our military

7626879 we are after all democrats so it may take a while
7626880 were not the fall in line party we are diverse but make no mistake we are unified
7626881 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7626882 were going to make sure that we win on november 4 so lets have a great convention
7626883 if we put the choice in front of delegates here and voters all across this country whos going to help rebuild this economy and put your family back to work whos going keep your family safe at night whos going to reduce our dependence on foreign oil the best person to do those things isnt john mccain its barack obama
7626884 want a leader whose judgment and experience they can trust
7626885 when hillary clinton was clearly in the democratic primaries the woman who the person who gathered the most votes 18 million of them was a great debater and a great campaigner
7626886 we want to make sure people know exactly who senator obama is and where he wants to take the country and two that voters know their choice in this election
7626887 we believe that post games and for a long period of time these venues will be used pretty well
7626888 the management companies will immediately open them up for public use
7626889 we cant expect in the short term all the investment will be regained right away
7626890 if we rely only on swimming pool tickets we certainly will lose money
7626891 so we will have other products to guarantee the operation in the long run
7626892 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7626893 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7626894 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7626895 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7626896 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7626897 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7626898 its not going to be short and swift but its begun nonetheless
7626899 you sit on that side you are now in the opposition
7626900 mr speaker sir this is a truly historic event and i would like on behalf of the president our party and this side of this august house to congratulate you
7626901 it would be illegal for anyone to be arrested while they were proceeding to parliament
7626902 we have been informed they want to arrest 15 mps its all about the vote for the speaker nothing to do with the law
7626903 clearly they have chosen the path of arrogance unilateralism thats a serious blow to confidence building in the talks
7626904 in 2002 ireland passed a tax on plastic grocery bags customers who want them must now pay 33 cents per bag at the register there was an advertising awareness campaign and then something happened that was bigger than the sum of these parts within weeks plastic bag use dropped 94 within a year nearly everyone had bought reusable cloth bags keeping them in offices and in the backs of cars plastic bags were not outlawed but carrying them became socially unacceptable on a par with wearing a fur coat or not cleaning up after ones dog
7626905 in large part due to the increased number of insured vehicles on b
7626906 no i dont think so at all the camaro started out not being a production program we did this pure concept car theres a couple of different kinds of concept cars
7626907 theres the kind i call fake which are so called precursors when the real car has already been decided on and is already in the hopper and is about eight months away from production and you do a conceptualized version reducing the roof height a little bit putting bigger wheels on like we did with the cadillac srx theyre a way of revealing most of the production intent of the car but making it a little more exciting and getting some advance press on it
7626908 then there are the other types of concept cars that start out as a pure concept just as a great idea sort of wouldnt that be nice with no intention of producing them whatsoever examples of that kind of car is the original pontiac solstice shown in 2002 and the camaro a lot of times what happens with those is that the car guys within the company do that car because the only thing that has a chance of convincing the corporation that it might be a good thing to do is the overwhelming success and response to the concept car
7626909 the skeptics in the company say oh no jeez we shouldnt be wasting our money on that these pony cars are short lived once the concept is shown the company is bombarded with emails and letters and even your own board members start asking whats to prevent us from doing this
7626910 once we showed the concept and it got a good reception we moved the implementation phase and since we were starting from scratch the concept had in no way been designed in a way to enable easy production it was a special version of the zeta rear wheel drive architecture and nobody had a clue how to get wheels that big onto that architecture and so on
7626911 so under three years from concept to production is pretty darn fast i dont think that hurt the car in fact i think there is a very agreeable surprise on everybodys part that the production car looks almost identical
7626912 well there certainly has been a de emphasis because of the fuel economy rules we have to bias the mix towards the vehicles with the v6 engines and discourage the sale of large powerful v8s thats what weve always said about the cafe legislation it puts us at war with market demand gasoline is four dollars a gallon and maybe someday going to five and six the market will automatically gravitate to the smaller engined cars
7626913 but thats the point weve always been making that with fuel economy mandates without a concomitant increase in gasoline prices you are going to have cars that the public desperately wants and youre going to have to say to the public im sorry i cant give you one of those
7626914 by june 2009 if security progress continues there would be no need for us troops in city centers
7626915 de keuzes die de pvda maakt maken nederland sterk en sociaal ze zorgen voor meer werk goede zorg zekerheid en veiligheid kansen voor jongeren waardigheid voor ouderen dat is de kern van de voorstellen van de pvda de alternatieve plannen van de pvda in de beterbegroting leiden tot een eerlijker verdeling van de lasten maar ook tot een stijging van het aantal banen in het onderwijs en zorg en een daling van de werkloosheid met enkele tienduizenden personen
7626916 uit doorrekening van de alternatieven van de pvda zal onomstotelijk blijken dat je voor hetzelfde geld betere keuzes kun maken dan het kabinet balkenende de pvda plannen leiden niet tot een hoger financieringstekort dan de kabinetsplannen

7626930 it was maybe an opportunity missed for the chinese to demonstrate their willingness to be more open and to allow more freedom of speech freedom of religion while the world was watching
7626931 so i would say perhaps were disappointed that they didnt take the full opportunity that was offered to them while the world was watching during these olympics
7626932 we think our relationship with china has had a positive impact on freedom and human rights in china

7626936 we have secured accommodation in mecca and in madina we have made deposits in mecca there is a lot of demolishing exercise in karba where we will perform most of the rites the demolishing exercise has created shortage of houses in the region
7626937 the situation has indeed cast a slur on the image of christendom and gradually the confidence and trust which people used to have for the church is eroding
7626938 the new educational reforms which were introduced recently even though encountered some few challenges from the beginning of its implementation have helped improved the quality of education in the country and that our expectation as a government is that all stakeholders will continue to help and advice us to make the programme a success

7626941 because true conservatives are pessimists they are happier than liberals for three reasons first pessimists are rarely surprised second when they are wrong they are delighted to be so third pessimists do not put their faith in princes in government they understand that happiness is a function of fending for oneself happiness is an activity it is inseparable from the pursuit of happiness

7626967 last year in june i made a big career move leaving the practice of law to become a compensation consultant two attorneys i had worked with for many years in the executive compensation group at wilson sonsini co founded a compensation consulting firm called compensia they seemed to be having a lot of fun and business was booming so i decided to join them i had become a victim of my own success at greenberg traurig and i was tired of the all consuming nature of the work its been quite a change going from a national law firm of over 1 500 attorneys to a 5 year old 25 person company while the transition has had its bumps so far it has been a great move compensia focuses on executive and equity compensation and advising compensation committees and boards of directors the potential of this business looks great because boards of directors increasingly want an outside adviser to assist them on the process of determining executive compensation in addition many of the incumbent consulting firms have conflicts of interest because they provide other consulting services to management so they do not appear to be an independent adviser to the board in addition my previous work in executive compensation is complementary to what i am doing now and i can leave the focus on the minutiae of the law to legal counsel additionally while the work is challenging i can better control the volume so that i am have some free time to spend with my family speaking of which since last i wrote a few years ago anne and i now have two children see attached photo max just turned 4 in december and katie is 2 we just got back from a great weekend trip to yosemite the park was spectacular in the snow the kids got to sled down a hill right below half dome best of all the work was manageable over the weekend and i actually got to play with the kids instead of my old law firm experience of being on the phone and the computer the whole time for the various weekend crisis

7626976 many times i have observed in my travels in the orient that fanaticism comes from a small number of dangerous men who maintain the others in the practice of religion by terror to liberate the muslim from his religion is the best service that one can render him
7626977 actually what they mean by islam is a religion of peace is that their mission is to make the whole world submit to the law of allah sharia and once that is accomplished there will be peace in the world therefore islam is a religion of peace thats not really peace as we know it

7626999 public television is an important resource for information about issues in arkansas nationally and across the globe
7627000 this funding will help public television continue to broadcast to residents in north central arkansas during the required switch to digital broadcasting to help lessen the burden for consumers making the transition i have also introduced legislation that would temporarily waive fees assigned to dtv converter boxes which will be required to retain access to television signals
7627001 public broadcasting is an important source of news and entertainment for many arkansans and these funds will ensure kemv can continue to serve its community
7627002 with only 5 months remaining until the digital transition i would urge families to prepare for this change by contacting my office or the federal communications commission
7627003 local news productions are an essential way to communicate to viewers about events happening in our own communities

7627016 that never made sense to me even if george w bush was telling the truth about weapons of mass destruction in fact particularly if he was telling the truth about weapons of mass destruction why the hell would you bomb a country that could fire back that would be insane bush did real damage to americas reputation around the world

7627024 our republic and its press will rise or fall together an able disinterested public spirited press with trained intelligence to know the right and courage to do it can preserve that public virtue without which popular government is a sham and a mockery a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself the power to mould the future of the republic will be in the hands of the journalists of future generations

7627030 it didnt take a great amount of movement to push harvard ahead of princeton
7627031 unless these indicators really mean something to students these rankings dont really mean anything except hype
7627032 its almost not important enough to have an opinion about
7627033 unfortunately it is also already clich d for someone from harvard to dismiss the rankings as unimportant while basking in the secret delight of being officially the best
7627034 i love harvard and i think its a great place
7627035 we believe these rankings are misleading and do not serve well the interests of prospective students in finding a college or university that is well suited to their education beyond high school
7627036 were not measuring learning or what goes on in the classroom
7627037 so our rankings are not perfect but we think an aggregation of our data using our methodology is a road to measuring the merits of an institution
7627038 the colleges are creating the frenzy and its not u s news
7627039 the colleges are the ones who have given u s news credibility in the marketplace
7627040 its nice to be recognized in this fashion but our admissions officers would certainly tell prospective students that they should look for selective colleges based on their own needs and not how a university or college is positioned in a ranking

7627047 i dont think that it is accurate to say that i have been missing nana akufo addo has put me in the security committee and we meet regularly
7627048 it is not being on the platform holding microphones to speak that constitutes a campaign
7627049 i am playing my role only that it appears to be a background security appointment
7627050 almighty god has always been my mainstay i didnt know i will go to parliament but god organised things in such a way that i found myself in parliament

7627061 forbyd tobak i danmark og helst ogs i resten af eu
7627062 fordi tobakken med 14 000 rlige danske d dsfald p samvittigheden er den st rste dr ber blandt livsstilssygdommenes faktorer den sl r tilmed tusinder af ikke rygere ihjel tobakken er desuden entydigt usund i mods tning til alkohol hvor et lille forbrug faktisk kan anbefales voksne endelig er tobakken let at regulere p i mods tning til for eksempel motion hvor klare forbud eller p bud ville v re uhyre komplicerede men jeg skal indr mme at det ville v re mere sexet at tale om sund kost og masser af motion end at g p banen med forbud mod tobak
7627063 m ske og man skal nok heller ikke lige levere en ny vare som mafiaen kan forhandle men holdningen til rygning er under forandring og rygerne er s sm t ved at udd selv om mange unge t ser desv rre er begyndt at tr kke statistikken i den forkerte retning om 5 10 r kan der n r alt kommer til alt v re basis for at g re endeligt op med tobakken det bliver en kamp mod liberalisterne for hvem ethvert statsindgreb er af det onde det kan her blive interessant at se hvilke politiske partier der modtager st tte fra tobaksindustrien og tobakkens detailhandlere
7627064 at en pakke cigaretter kommer til at koste 100 200 kroner og kun kan k bes p apoteket
7627065 jo men begr nsninger kendes og accepteres bredt p andre omr der for eksempel hastighedsgr nser tvungen brug af sikkerhedssele og afskaffelsen af revselsesretten det er i vrigt sp rgsm let hvor frit man handler hvis man som ganske ung begynder at ryge og resten af livet er s afh ngig at man ikke magter at holde op selv om man virkelig gerne vil
7627066 det er gode og n dvendige ting som blot har vist sig ikke at kunne st alene der bredte sig i 1980erne en holdning i samfundet om at nu m tte det v re op til den enkelte og folk blev m dt med velmenende l ftede pegefingre i dag ved vi at kampagnerne for eksempel ikke har kunnet s nke alkoholforbruget allerh jst forhindret det i at stige hver dansker drikker fortsat i gennemsnit 2 5 genstande om dagen hvilket er langt over det l geligt forsvarlige derfor kr ves der strukturelle tiltag
7627067 f rst og fremmest at forbyde salg af alkohol til unge under 18 r det er nemlig et stort problem at alkoholen er blevet v ldigt tilg ngelig fordi den er blevet relativt billigere og s lges flere steder end tidligere dertil kommer mere aggressive markedsf ringsformer fra bryggeriernes side det er i vrigt uforst eligt at der ikke straks indf res forbud mod enhver form for alkoholreklame her kunne det v re interessant se p hvilke partier der modtager st tte fra blandt andet bryggerierne
7627068 nej og man kan udm rket anl gge en slags lomborg vinkel p sagen og se p hvilke investeringer der vil komme godt igen s tter man ind over for fedme blandt b rn for eksempel med skolekantiner med sund mad vil der ad re kunne spares svimlende bel b i sundhedsv snet man skal blot v re opm rksom p at en madordning ikke m v re for ldrebetalt men gratis for alle ellers vil de mindrebemidledes b rn ikke komme med og den sociale ulighed i sundheden vil blive forst rket gratis skolemad m i vrigt kombineres med andre tiltag for eksempel i byplanl gningen s b rn trygt kan motionere ved at cykle i skole
7627069 ikke gennem individ orienterede opfordringer i form af sundhedskampagner som uge 40 og 6 om dagen desv rre for jeg er varm tilh nger af oplysning strukturelle tiltag derimod for eksempel en generel ordning med skolemad eller en drastisk afgiftsforh jelse p tobak n r frem til og v rner om de svage som ofte er dem der ikke magter at tage sagen i egen h nd det s re er at danmark sammenlignet med de andre nordiske lande er s d rlig til at tage h nd om de svage selv om vi gerne bryster os af det modsatte i danmark var der i 1920erne en st rk afholdsbev gelse men den blev l bet over ende af de moderne tider i sverige og norge hvor religionen har haft st rre betydning er der flere restriktioner over for alkohol og tobak det kan direkte afl ses i en h jere levealder

7627079 we know that isolation is significant because the russians have complained about it for over a decade
7627080 the west has treated russia like an object and not a player russia has sought to be at the table so now the west faces a catch 22 we can threaten russias exclusion from the international community but that threat is one of the main causes of russias anger
7627081 the big minus is something we previously suspected but now know for sure that russia is completely alone the notion of strategic solitude has been discussed in our academic journals for some time but now its clear that russia finds itself without any sympathy in the world
7627082 the upcoming launch of the vip jkb card emphasizes our interest in diversifying our customer base

7627103 reactie op publicaties in de media over subsidies aan milieuorganisaties
7627104 waarom subsidieert vrom milieuorganisaties eigenlijk omdat we het belangrijk vinden burgers te betrekken bij het milieubeleid en omdat we de interesse voor milieuvraagstukken willen vergroten
7627105 met enige regelmaat wordt de detailhandel geconfronteerd met slecht uitgevoerd amateuristisch onderzoek kennelijk bedoeld om de detailhandel in een kwaad daglicht te plaatsen

7627112 het is hoogst merkwaardig dat vissers greenpeace betichten van crimineel gedrag als er n sector is die duizenden regels aan zn laars lapt is het de visserij de pot verwijt de ketel
7627113 wij gebruiken subsidiegeld niet om kabinetsbeleid te verhinderen de subsidies gebruiken we meestal voor publieksacties
7627114 anderzijds vinden wij dit een goede zaak omdat het ons mogelijk maakt een onafhankelijke positie ten opzichte van de overheid in te nemen
7627115 wij vragen nooit subsidie aan omdat we volledig onafhankelijk willen zijn maar dat een samenleving geld geeft aan tegenstanders bewijst dat er een democratie is alleen zie je wel dat bij organisaties die subsidie krijgen de fundamentele kritiek ontbreekt de vraag of we economische groei wel nodig hebben is daar eigenlijk taboe die durven gesubsidieerde milieuorganisaties niet te stellen
7627116 het financieren van tegenkracht is de kern van een democratie
7627117 het idee achter het geven van subsidie is dat je als overheid niet wordt bestookt door mensen die zomaar iets roepen maar door deskundigen
7627118 oh you dont mean nothing at all to me no you dont mean nothing at all to me but you got what it takes to set me free oh you could mean everything to me

7627122 a necessidade urgente de solucionar os problemas decorrentes do aumento do com rcio informal
7627123 escutei a queixa de que programas como o pac de desenvolvimento industrial provocam um tipo de desenvolvimento que n o leva em conta as particularidades dos povos ind genas sobretudo nas demarca es das terras e em muitos casos est o em tens o com interesses de povos ind genas
7627124 pode ser que dentro do pac existam elementos especialmente formais que considerem o interesse dos ind genas mas na pr tica n o acontece verificamos que muitas vezes os programas n o reconhecem e n o levam em considera o os direitos dos povos ind genas
7627125 embora sejam culturalmente ricos os povos ind genas continuam empobrecidos economicamente e continuamente sufocados pela discrimina o

7627129 one of the major reasons the protests snowballed to the levels weve seen
7627130 is that we allowed hard line islamists to run of the city allowing them to use mosques to broadcast appeals for people to come out on the streets our withdrawal also allowed them to pressure people otherwise unsympathetic to the secessionist cause to join the protests
7627131 o mercado est acompanhando os problemas l de fora internamente est bastante tranquilo

7627134 we will know something more in the next day or so
7627135 well son it is a memorial to the young men and women who died in the service
7627136 this is just another clear effort by the radical left latte drinkers to diminish the brave history of the avalanche a hockey team consisting of good hard working regular americans north americans almost all of whom are probably former prisoners of war the nuggets are elitist and naive and lack the experience necessary to be considered a serious professional sports team and i heard they bump fists to congratulate each other which is un american and probably a jihadist gesture
7627137 they obviously have no concern for the avalanche those heroes in burgundy and blue who have long fought to keep us all free from the tyrannical onslaught of the wretched calgarians and edmontonians did you know that joe sakic spent five years in a canadian prison camp true story

7627140 la idea de que un hombre as sea presidente de un pa s como ste es una broma rid cula
7627141 si no he dejado claro con mi actuaci n que eso s lo puede ser una mentira quiz es que la opini n que tengo sobre mi persona est equivocada
7627142 here is what the catechism of the catholic church says human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
7627143 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
7627144 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7627145 here is what the catechism of the catholic church says human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
7627146 whether joe biden is as ignorant of what his religion teaches remains to be seen
7627147 so there we have it the man running for president on the democratic ticket supports selective infanticide his running mate is a pro abortion catholic the delegates are wildly out of step with americans on abortion and the speaker of the house hasnt a clue what her religion teaches on the subject
7627148 provided we are always disposed to listen with religious obedience to what the holy see may decide on a question
7627149 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it
7627150 t he lord asked cain where is your brother abel
7627151 i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that that has moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
7627152 those of us like myself believe that in this difficult situation procuring an abortion it is a womans responsibility and choice to make in consultation with her doctor and her pastor and her family
7627153 on this fundamental issue i will not yield and planned parenthood will not yield
7627154 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7627155 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation
7627156 whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7627157 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder

7627242 we hebben een prijs in ons hoofd en psv biedt nog niet eens de helft vertelde az directeur marcel brands aan het
7627243 vier clubs uit het binnen en buitenland hebben zich inmiddels gemeld bij ons
7627244 er is al het dubbele geboden van wat psv bij ons heeft neergelegd terwijl die clubs ook de indicatie hebben gegeven dat tim elders veel meer kan verdienen
7627245 barcelona en sevilla zullen allebei hun laatste wedstrijden winnen daarom zullen wij ook de laatste twee duels moeten winnen sevilla speelt tegen mallorca en villarreal terwijl barcelona uitkomt tegen espanyol en gimn stic daar moeten wij eigenlijk niet naar kijken gewoon de laatste twee duels winnen en we zijn kampioen
7627246 hoe we gaan spelen tegen zaragoza gewoon zoals we de laatste zes duels gedaan hebben we hebben laten zien in vorm te zijn en met onze winnaarsmentaliteit ben ik ervan overtuigd dat we gaan winnen we spelen goed de bal rond tonen agressiviteit en de doelpunten komen dan vanzelf
7627247 over de mogelijke interesse in arjen robben wil ik niet praten ik ben nu alleen bezig met de wedstrijd tegen real zaragoza wat er volgend seizoen gaat gebeuren heeft nu geen enkel nut in de zomer zullen we wel zien wie er komt en vertrekt maar nu moeten we ons bezighouden met zaragoza
7627248 ik had eigenlijk niet verwacht om zoveel te scoren in mijn eerste seizoen een nieuwe club en een nieuwe omgeving speelt toch een belangrijke rol maar goed al scoor ik er dertig zonder de landstitel is het seizoen niet geslaagd
7627249 ik denk niet dat zaragoza voordeel heeft dat wij de afgelopen dagen veel internationals hebben gemist zij hebben tenslotte ook enkele argentijnse spelers moeten afstaan vervelend is wel dat david beckham nu last heeft van een blessure hij is toch n van de redenen voor onze opmars van de laatste maanden
7627250 natuurlijk wil ik de gouden bal winnen ik heb daarvoor nog drie treffers nodig we zullen zien als ik drie keer scoor dan lijkt het me sterk dat we niet de landstitel winnen een dubbele premie dus
7627251 in principe zijn we het met z roberto eens over een tweejarig contract we moeten alleen nog enkele probleempjes oplossen
7627252 wij zijn van mening dat het niet goed is dat een speler die al een beetje op leeftijd is nog vijf keer per jaar de atlantische oceaan overvliegt we hebben volgend seizoen zon druk jaar dat we alleen spelers kunnen gebruiken die zich helemaal geven
7627253 we hebben ons nooit met dat onderwerp bezig gehouden en we hebben ook geen bod uitgebracht
7627254 vier clubs uit het binnen en buitenland hebben zich inmiddels gemeld bij ons
7627255 er is al het dubbele geboden van wat psv bij ons heeft neergelegd terwijl die clubs ook de indicatie hebben gegeven dat tim elders veel meer kan verdienen
7627256 met deze stap wil ik duidelijk maken dat ik mijzelf altijd verbonden heb gevoeld met de selectie met de club en de hondstrouwe aanhang ik ben ervan overtuigd dat de grote plannen van juventus daadwerkelijk tot successen zullen gaan leiden
7627257 eindelijk komt mijn droom uit ik wilde alleen maar naar psv toe zei de aanvaller nadat hij met een brede grijns zijn nieuwe shirts had getoond ik ben heel blij toen ik zeven jaar geleden in de jeugd speelde was er al interesse van psv maar toen ging ik naar partizan belgrado
7627258 later dacht ik weer voorzichtig aan psv dat al mateja kezman had en werd het feyenoord nu was het voor mij heel duidelijk er is maar een club waar ik naartoe zou willen en dat is psv anders was ik bij vitesse gebleven
7627259 bremen heeft al een tijdje een aanbieding van ons liggen voor miroslav klose
7627260 ze weten al tien dagen wat wij voor hem over hebben
7627261 wij praten nu niet met bayern verder wil ik er niets over kwijt
7627262 de komst van robben was al een van mijn doelen toen ik kandidaat was voor het voorzitterschap en dat is nog steeds zo
7627263 goh dat is opmerkelijk want ik heb met niemand van real gesproken
7627264 ik dacht dat iedereen nu toch wel zou moeten weten dat arjen op het punt staat zijn contract bij chelsea te verlengen tot medio 2012 daarin is niet veranderd
7627265 dat hadden we al eerder willen doen maar dat is er door de drukke werkzaamheden van hem kenyon red niet van gekomen
7627266 het is inderdaad waar dat sevilla mij een aanbieding heeft gedaan via mijn zaakwaarnemer
7627267 nu moeten beide clubs alleen nog overeenstemming bereiken om de transfer door te laten gaan ik wil dolgraag voor sevilla spelen
7627268 voor hoeveel seizoenen ik kan tekenen vier of vijf volgens mij maar dit is echt niet het moment om hierover te praten laten we eerst maar afwachten of de clubs eruit komen de spaanse competitie trekt mij erg aan en de champions league nog veel meer
7627269 of ik jes s navas ken ja natuurlijk ken ik hem een razendvlugge buitenspeler hoe ik ben nou ik ben ook snel en ik ben pas 21 ik denk dat ik wel beter kan worden
7627270 roberto carlos wilde vorig seizoen al naar fenerbah e komen maar toen was zijn contract een probleem hij is echter een man van zijn woord en wilde dolgraag naar deze club komen
7627271 deze transfer is erg belangrijk voor mij het is een eer om voor fenerbah e uit te komen
7627272 we hebben een speler binnengehaald die voldoet aan de eisen van de club we moeten ook president aziz y ld r m bedanken zonder hem zou het een stuk moeilijker zijn om spelers van wereldklasse binnen te halen

7627284 the slowdown in housing starts has been very painful for the industry but it is the necessary medicine to work down the inventory of unsold homes

7627298 but while he was still a long way off his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him he ran to his son threw his arms around him and kissed him

7627649 the canadian forces along with our other government departments need to be ready to respond to threats such as environmental accidents oil spills and potentially communicable disease outbreaks on a cruise ship
7627650 i imagine crude and natural gas traders are closing positions out ahead of what could be a problem
7627651 traders dont like open positions when there could be a supply disruption by a storm
7627652 the main reason behind fridays move was the same as what took prices higher in the first place the dollar
7627653 fridays about face in the greenback spurred broad based sell offs in a number of other commodity complexes besides energy
7627654 being driven by the dollar and central bank policy and issues like war and supply demand take a back seat
7627655 we could see further weakness gnaw at the markets over the next few weeks as weaker demand aggravates the excess supply problem
7627656 after russian lawmakers voted to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia the two breakaway georgian regions

7627659 he may well have been the worst possible pick among congressional democrats when it comes to the drug war and criminal justice

7627680 it was out of the question i hated the idea of being in a dormitory with other people no no no
7627681 my sisters were sent away because my mother thought they were boring i was not boring
7627682 the worst thing is when friends say remember the good old days forget about the good old days that just makes your present second hand what is interesting is now if you think it was better before then you might as well commit suicide immediately
7627683 often things arent that important im not that important either i dont take myself too seriously
7627684 im in a permanent bad mood with myself thinking i could always do better that there is more its like there is this glass wall and i cant get through to the other side
7627685 im not one of those people who think theyre more artistic than their profession come on youre selling things that make people happy not difficult pregnancies i cant stand designers who talk about their work being art

7627689 today the parliament was doing the paperwork on what has happened de facto russia has formally acknowledged that it is a protector of south ossetia and abkhazia
7627690 the parliament is so dependent on the kremlin that i am sure it was ordered by medvedevs administration to back the independence bids
7627691 if they choose to break off this relationship even the whole of it nothing terrible will happen
7627692 i am positive that europe and the u s will respond in a reasonable manner the u s economic situation is not good russia is on the rise
7627693 it created a competition between the two sides with one side trying to deal with these conflicts and the other wanting to blow them up
7627694 we have to state once again that russia has never given its consent to a replacement of russian peacekeepers in the conflict zone with
7627695 it was a vote of strategic significance for modern history
7627696 russia has shown that it feels responsible for the security in the region and adopted a role of the guardian of contemporary international law

7627709 often state institutions which are expected to serve the public break down due to a surplus of employees this is the result of arbitrary appointments given by politicians therefore de politicising these institutions is essential to make them viable
7627710 it is not a fact to be astonished about the collapse of any institution if the monthly income of that particular institution is insufficient to pay the salaries of its employees the moves taken by the ancl to pay compensation to the employees under its vrs without putting them under pressure to resign is something that is praiseworthy
7627711 it is a great pleasure to have a veteran journalist like bandula padmakumara as the chairman of the lake house
7627712 under this scheme nearly 1 000 employees should be voluntary retired nearly 600 employees have at present applied for the vrs
7627713 our business users are using safari to deliver jasperreports to them on their iphone while the effort to write the 100 lines of java code to build an iphone app is minimal its just not needed
7627714 it allows iphone users to access salesforce crm applications and more than 70 000 force com custom applications right from their iphone
7627715 from a historic standpoint the mobile revolution began in the 90s with the mass adoption of mobile phones as a primary means of communication soon mobile e mail became a way of life in the enterprise as consumers and professionals became more familiar with mobile devices and as mobile devices became more like mobile laptops end users increasingly desired and expected to be able to do everything from the mobile devices that they could do from their desks
7627716 its not meant to replace a dashboard and analytical apps that have a whole bunch of drilldowns but rather to give you handy access to core sets of metrics we wanted to make usage and availability ubiquitous and let users tailor the information to exactly what they want to see
7627717 since we support the iphones alerting mechanisms you dont have to go hunting for information youll get alerted when data crosses a threshold that you or someone else has set
7627718 the cool thing is that youre actually developing in cocoa and the mac os environment so in terms of the development environment its very mature and complete
7627719 thanks to the iphones robust development environment we were able to develop test and deliver salesforce mobile for the iphone all in less than three months
7627720 salesforce com and apple will continue to work closely to iterate and expand the breadth of functionality of salesforce mobile for the iphone to expand the ways that enterprises can use salesforce crm and force com applications to improve the way they work
7627721 ooooh thats so wonderful i could never do something like that
7627722 oh no oh no i could never i just am no good at things like that

7627725 theyre still not in compliance with the cease fire agreement theyve established a number of checkpoints near the port city of poti and were very concerned about what russia is not doing and thats pulling its forces out in accordance with the cease fire agreement
7627726 and i think what you will conclude is gee he is sort of like us
7627727 he is still not that well known in parts of the country
7627728 and because he has been caricatured by the other republican side his speech is probably more important than most acceptance speeches are
7627729 what obama is hoping for out of this week is a redefinition of himself and his campaign that is lasting and that is appealing to the american people
7627730 we are committed to the annapolis process we are doing the work that needs to be done to try to get an agreement before the end of the bush administration
7627731 the constituency consists of 69 percent malay 25 percent chinese and the remainder being indian if you look at the malay vote if he manages to woo them if he manages to pull 70 strong to 80 percent many people in umno would jump because they would see that he controls the malay support
7627732 if you jump sooner then you can hope to get a position in his new government you jump later he may not even pick you
7627733 the umno machinery has been playing up ethnic sentiments to its height they openly compare chinese as pigs
7627734 you never do that publicly never put that in a campaign and this time around umno used that in a malay area hoping that would push up the malay support to create that sense that if you have anwar winning the chinese and the indians are going to dominate the country
7627735 gambari is coming under criticism by the national league for democracy for his lackluster diplomatic style
7627736 i think in the circumstances he spent nearly a week there did not see aung san suu kyi did not see than shwe the junta leader i think his role is effectively over
7627737 it is very clear aung san suu kyi has made it incredibly clear by refusing to meet with mr gambari that she has lost confidence in this process and she refuses to engage in this process
7627738 through these games the world learnt more about china and china learned more about the world

7627742 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character
7627743 however jacqueline doesnt want to offend her readers or her readers parents so when the book comes to be reprinted the word will be replaced with twit
7627744 everyone was polite and seemed interested but no one offered to raise money to build her
7627745 you can take the hardest rock band on the earth and they sound like a bunch of girls next to the dubliners
7627746 you are a cock slut arent you all those times fucking me when all you really needed was my big dick in your ass you like it dont you seeing me above you pinching your nipple
7627747 hello neville why are you in my bedroom and can i keep the seat it works well with the overall flow of the room
7627748 seriously why are you here and how did you get in shouldnt you be uncomfortably sitting at my mothers dining table and blushing while she tries to pick out your china patterns and george says something inappropriate about your relationship with bill
7627749 i would be if my lovers favorite brother was in his proper seat sitting beside him giving barbs right back to george and making your mums meddling worth while he loves you in much the same way that you obviously love him but you have got to be two of the most stubborn men i have ever met
7627750 what are you talking about of course i love him hes my brother
7627751 charlie i may not speak very much around your family but i observe everything and i always see you i notice your love for your job and all animals i notice the fact that you love all your siblings and want to make sure you are a part of their lives i also notice that your love for one is different from the rest i see the way you look at bill when you think he cant see i saw your face when you couldnt take your eyes off him friday night i know you came harder than ever before when he said your name

7627943 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days

7627950 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7627951 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7627952 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7627953 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7627954 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7627955 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7627956 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7627957 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7627958 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7627959 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7627960 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7627961 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7627962 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7627963 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7627964 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7627965 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7627966 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7627967 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7627968 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7627969 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7627970 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7627971 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7627972 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7627973 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7627974 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

7627985 today the parliament was doing the paperwork on what has happened de facto russia has formally acknowledged that it is a protector of south ossetia and abkhazia
7627986 the parliament is so dependent on the kremlin that i am sure it was ordered by medvedevs administration to back the independence bids
7627987 if they choose to break off this relationship even the whole of it nothing terrible will happen
7627988 i am positive that europe and the u s will respond in a reasonable manner the u s economic situation is not good russia is on the rise
7627989 it created a competition between the two sides with one side trying to deal with these conflicts and the other wanting to blow them up
7627990 we have to state once again that russia has never given its consent to a replacement of russian peacekeepers in the conflict zone with
7627991 it was a vote of strategic significance for modern history
7627992 russia has shown that it feels responsible for the security in the region and adopted a role of the guardian of contemporary international law
7627993 what theyre doing is annexing parts of an emerging european democracy

7627996 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7627997 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7627998 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

7628022 concerns were expressed regarding abortion despite the specific assurances in terms of irelands legal arrangements in this regard
7628023 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
7628024 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
7628025 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
7628026 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
7628027 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
7628028 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
7628029 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
7628030 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
7628031 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt
7628032 as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business
7628033 the refusal is based upon his felony conviction as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business he does not get a waiver to entry despite his conviction as other convicted ira members have
7628034 he could apply again but the likelihood of his being able to enter the states is slim to none given both his record and the political climate
7628035 there is a famous story from seoul in 1988 that there were so many used condoms on the roof terrace of the british teams residential block the night after the swimming concluded that the british olympic association sent out an edict banning outdoor sex here in beijing organisers have realised that such prohibitions are about as useful as banning breathing and have instead handed out thousands of free condoms to the athletes if you cant stop em at least make it safe

7628041 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
7628042 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7628043 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
7628044 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
7628045 comments such as these are clearly part of the pathetic choreography surrounding the so called policing and justice saga members of mr caol ins own party are disenchanted not only by the failure of their leaders to secure the devolution of such powers to stormont but also by their cosy relationship with the dup
7628046 martin mcguinness is on holiday and sinn fein has no interest in responding to demands by reg empey
7628047 the criminal cases review commission recommended that his case go back to the court of appeal which this summer cleared him
7628048 aided and abetted by secret sects satanic groups and new age movements
7628049 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7628050 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7628051 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7628052 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7628053 last saturday night there was a rocket attack in the middle of lisnaskea co fermanagh in which several police officers were nearly murdered there was no coordinated political response an emergency executive meeting was convened to address floods while the attempted murder of police went unmentioned if there was a rocket attack on garda in dublin city centre on saturday night brian cowen would call an emergency meeting of political and security figures to agree a strategy to deal with the threat while i dont want to over emphasise the dissident threat they are intent on killing police and there could be civilian deaths too

7628058 gordon smith the sfas chief executive has spoken to the prime minister about team gb but we are unlikely to alter our position and remain opposed to the concept of a great britain football team
7628059 how can you have a great britain football team which includes northern ireland would you therefore support changing the name to team uk
7628060 no country in its right mind would want this pervert at large on its soil

7628072 the imaginary time bomb why an ageing population is not a social problem
7628073 historically modern societies double their wealth about every twenty five years this kind of growth projected across the next half century would dwarf the extra pension and other costs to society of more elderly dependents moreover it is far from certain that extra years of life mean extra years of ill health and dependency serious disease tends to be concentrated towards the end of life so living longer may simply postpone the point of onset without increasing the costs

7628218 our cruising experiences are far more intimate whether a guest is on a tauck exclusive small ship charter exploring the dalmatian coast or part of a tauck group aboard a large liner in the south pacific
7628219 that human activity is a significant cause of global warming has been soundly rebuked by qualified scientists using sound methodologies while the earth has undergone numerous cycles of warming and cooling trends there is no indication that human activities either now or in the past had a significant effect on these trends
7628220 i am an organic farmer i am an enviromentalist by nature i do not however believe in global warming caused by pollution we need to stop pollution for other reasons
7628221 evidence developed since 2001 shows that this issue is essentially over according to david evans australias chief scientist on climate from 1999 to 2005 there is no observable heat signature in the atmosphere to show that greenhouse gases are responsible for trapping heat and satellite data show earths temperature stabilized in 2001 and actually dropped 0 6c in 2007 that is 85 of the 0 7c increase recorded over the previous 100 years
7628222 at this point i do not believe that the scientific evidence supports the position that global warming if the same exists is not a function of sun activity rather than human activity no study i have been made aware of uses mandlebrot mathematics chaos math to do its projections it is a fact that the mathematics of climateology requires the use of chaos mathematics to describe it as it is a chaotic system the use of liner models is just bunk
7628223 if you look at history you see variations in temperature from ice ages to times when it has been much warmer than now the corelation between co2 and warming has been disproven th esun is responsible for most warming between 1940 and 1980 when co2 levels were rising temperatures were falling temperatures have been falling again for 6 years some scientists are warning of an ice age again that was the big fear when i was in school then came the hole in the ozone layer
7628224 i believe there is a global climate change taking place which appears to be cyclical every 50 100 years
7628225 not all scientist agree with that premise at least 36 000 we cannot predict what the water vapor levels in the atmosphere going to be ten days from let alone 10 or 12 years environmental problems can be better solve through monetary and fiscal policy reform so that manufacturing does not have to depend on large economies of scale and mass production to be competitive that is a better solution to new and global taxes i feel that the evironmental movement is more about politics than clean air
7628226 holland america lines commitment to excellence isnt something that just exists once our guests step on board our ships

7628583 when we brought don in we restructured our original idea around some of his insights
7628584 how often do we bring in a third creative partner to the table with a veteran marketing agency and shake things up by saying hey we have this idea and we think you can help us and nike has always been about collaboration with its athletes so we brought in a promotional expert to help promote the u s open and this rivalry in a way that maybe we havent done in a very long time

7628592 its tough to answer the golota questions because he was the man who inspired me to box i saw him fight riddick bowe in 1996 and knew right then that i wanted to be a fighter
7628593 but obviously hes disappointed everyone over the years you cant find a way to lose that often in so many weird ways without hurting your legacy

7628595 hes a great fighter im a great fighter but im going to be a great champion

7628603 i think it recognises the importance of her race of 18 million people voting for her
7628604 he is going to have to reinforce his capacity for leadership
7628605 we will be looking for cues in what she says
7628606 the last few times she expressed support for obama people picked up that she still wants delegates to fight for her
7628607 my sense is that we will lose hundreds of delegates
7628608 i think after the election many of her supporters female and male were in mourning

7628637 pode ser que dentro do pac existam elementos especialmente formais que considerem o interesse dos ind genas mas na pr tica n o acontece verificamos que muitas vezes os programas n o reconhecem e n o levam em considera o os direitos dos povos ind genas

7628674 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7628675 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7628676 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7628677 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7628678 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games

7628680 in the 1970s and early 1980s movements in overall prices and prices excluding food and energy prices both contained information about the trend in recent data the trend is best gauged by focusing solely on prices excluding food and energy prices
7628681 the most recent data suggest that surprises in overall inflation have had no information for trend inflation all of the information regarding trend has been contained in prices excluding food and energy prices
7628682 however total inflation is typically much more strongly influenced by temporary changes in relative prices than core inflation this suggests a potential role for core inflation as an indicator of the subsequent trajectory of total inflation
7628683 the role of the board of directors in corporate social responsibility
7628684 long term investors are realizing that how the firm manages its social and environmental impacts and responds to social and environmental trends can affect long term firm performance
7628685 as i show in my study increasingly boards of directors are starting to integrate social and environmental considerations csr into their strategy and risk management csr is moving into the boardroom with the growing realization of the business case for csr once csr moves into the boardroom it becomes a factor in board governance
7628686 analysts thought leaders and board directors themselves perceive a definite albeit modest trend toward greater integration of csr considerations into business strategy and boardrooms
7628687 increasingly directors are coming to understand the csr business case there is a growing awareness that pro active management of a firms social and environmental risks and opportunities can result in sustainable value creation
7628688 the role of the chair is key to setting the tone and creating a culture of openness amongst the board of directors to facilitate consideration of csr issues
7628689 group think can often get in the way of csr consideration
7628690 stakeholders seeking to affect a firms approach to csr increasingly come to understand that boards of directors set the tone at the top and are responsible for the overall direction of the firm in that they have oversight over the firms values and sustainability performance the ceos incentive program and the firms business strategy
7628691 for successful management of a firms sustainability performance the board needs to demonstrate its commitment and oversight of csr
7628692 these are key to successful csr integration and embedment the board must show its active ownership of this issue and its awareness of its role in the absence of which a firms commitment to effective social and environmental performance management could be suspect
7628693 wow thats neat i guess i dont need to bother you guys anymore

7628701 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7628702 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7628703 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7628704 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7628705 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7628706 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

7628716 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp
7628717 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7628718 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp there were many casualties up to now we have 27 confirmed dead and 75 wounded
7628719 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7628720 we called off regular patrols in kalma because it is not part of our mandate to search for arms and arrest individuals
7628721 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7628722 a unamid police and military force accessed the camp and we are prepared for possible assistance in the case of evacuating any type of casualties
7628723 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement
7628724 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7628725 what i understand is that the iraqi parliament will not pass this agreement
7628726 at this moment the iraqi government and parliament are not ready for such a deal which will face a lot of hurdles
7628727 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and national interests of iraq
7628728 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and we cannot grant full immunity
7628729 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament

7628740 considero que en el tiempo transcurrido no ha habido avances significativos en las reparaciones el tema de la reconciliaci n es parte de un proceso que implica la comprensi n del estado de su rol de promotor de condiciones para una vida digna cuando entregamos el informe se distorsionaron muchas cosas sobre lo que significaba esto de a pocos la poblaci n y los pol ticos est n entendiendo que la reconciliaci n es mirar para adentro

7628778 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7628779 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states to lead our country into the future thats what this convention is about
7628780 respectful of all who have contributed senator clinton certainly made a tremendous contribution as a candidate we are all tremendously in her debt
7628781 president clinton was a great president of the united states and the contrast between him and george bush is something that will not be lost on voters
7628782 but we are on to the next stage of this
7628783 rather than sit around and talk about this weve got a challenge out there that must be met so thats where were going into the future again respectful of all concerned

7628888 angry odinga supporters crying fraud sparked riots that resulted in some 1 500 deaths amid his ancestral countrys civil unrest sen barack obama took time out from the campaign trail to phone odinga to voice his support
7628889 angry odinga supporters crying fraud sparked riots that resulted in some 1 500 deaths amid his ancestral countrys civil unrest sen barack obama took time out from the campaign trail to phone odinga to voice his support
7628890 obviously he believes that the votes were not tallied properly but what i urged was that all the leaders there regardless of their position on the election tell their supporters to stand down to desist with the violence and resolve it in a peaceful way in accordance with kenyan law
7628891 obamas advisers said the illinois senator has been working the phones for the past week to urge an end to the bloodletting he spoke to odinga for about five minutes monday before going into a rally in lebanon n h
7628892 urged an end to violence and that mr odinga sit down without preconditions with president mwai kibaki to resolve this issue peacefully
7628893 obamas campaign said the candidate had spoken to secretary of state condoleezza rice late monday about the situation in kenya the call was confirmed by the state department which provided no details because it did not want to involve rice in politics
7628894 as kenya boiled obama reached out to secretary of state condoleezza rice to discuss the situation im told it was obamas idea to put out the statement
7628895 obama was coordinating his efforts with the state department his advisers said he discussed the situation with secretary of state condoleezza rice on jan 1 the following day obama recorded a statement with voice of america after a canvass kickoff in davenport iowa
7628896 like obamas father odinga was a member of the luo tribe of kenya his son raila odinga ran for president in 2006 that year obama traveled to kenya and appeared with odinga at rallies where he criticized the pro u s government odinga wanted to oust
7628897 has remained neutral in kenyan politics and did not support odinga during his trip
7628898 like many nations across this continent where kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable one that serves its people and is free from corruption but while corruption is a problem we all share here in kenya it is a crisis a crisis thats robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for the opportunity they deserve
7628899 pervasive corruption has been a major reason for disinvestments in kenya corruption and insecurity remain the major challenges for the current government
7628900 in 2007 the human rights situation was shaped by the run up to the december elections and the persistent corruption that has plagued the nation for decades action to address kenyas longstanding problems with corruption continue to be desultory

7628923 after the industrys recent boom years wind power providers and experts are now concerned the facilities may not be as reliable and durable as producers claim indeed with thousands of mishaps breakdowns and accidents having been reported in recent years the difficulties seem to be mounting

7628928 if you dont want to vote for your grandpa or some secret muslim al qaeda spy
7628929 take this message home this is a nationally significant issue
7628930 you should care about it because of energy maritime agriculture seafood and money
7628931 one hundred fifty billion dollars has been spent on the recovery and in some places not much has changed
7628932 eighty to 90 percent of those dollars 80 to 90 percent of those lives could have been saved with preventative measures of about 8 to 10 billion
7628933 the fact that were having 130 to 140 a barrel and 4 per gallon gasoline prices today is making everyone realize that we need to get as independent as possible on energy in this country
7628934 this makes me more sympathetic to my friends in louisiana
7628935 during katrina you saw human suffering but you didnt see the ecological impact like we did today
7628936 in my area we drill a lot for oil too saltwater migration affects wildlife wetlands commerce it all goes together
7628937 if we had those buffers below houma we would not have those problems that we did for katrina
7628938 the basic assumption was that the land of coastal louisiana is a gift of the mississippi river and all of its sediment so if you take a third of it away what will happen with the land
7628939 and the conventional wisdom at the time was that the delta had been building land for 5 000 years and it was still merrily building land and everything was cool
7628940 the state was losing land at a clip of about 16 square miles per year
7628941 i think weve had clear definitions of the problem since the mid 1970s and certainly by the early 1990s other than a commitment to close mr go the mississippi river gulf outlet we really havent launched any major regional type projects
7628942 this is clearly an expression of a sense of urgency
7628943 its a major commitment from the state the governor is clearly in support of restoring the coast
7628944 if it is a down payment on a restored coast and truly integrated storm protection then it will be remembered as historic
7628945 if it is a one time thing and is spent on uncoordinated projects it will be just an expensive missed opportunity it is everyones business to make sure that isnt the case
7628946 to achieve energy production and transportation in a sustainable way
7628947 we have a lot in common with the people around the table
7628948 the significance of the accord is in the diversity of groups involved in it that doesnt mean we agree on everything but were finding out where we do have common ground and were trying to move forward on that
7628949 weve got to begin to define the true requirements and desires of this section of the country
7628950 with the force of four states and four congressional delegations going to congress we should be in significantly better shape
7628951 the effects of climate change appear to be intensifying and are expected to get worse
7628952 if sea level rise doubles or triples the rate of coastal submergence will accelerate here
7628953 the key factor is that we are missing leadership particularly in the psc
7628954 the psc does not require entergy to enter into negotiations for a long term power purchase agreement unless the utility company agrees to buy it theres no reason to build a wind farm nobodys going to finance it
7628955 there is a continuing dialogue going on and our working group was tasked with developing some text that would address mitigation in greater detail so im not at all concerned that this will not happen
7628956 historically louisiana has had boom and bust cycles were still an oil and gas state
7628957 we need to be very real and upfront in acknowledging the environmental impacts of oil and gas developments theres an inherent inconsistency that everywhere outside of louisiana is painfully obvious but inside louisiana the prevailing mindset is that being americas energy coast is only a good thing
7628958 human activity that has accompanied 90 percent of this countrys oil and gas development
7628959 in many ways it doesnt matter if dredging has caused 30 or 90 percent of the land loss because either is a rationale for doing something about their impacts and basically little of anything is being done to address the impacts of oil and gas canals
7628960 they spend maybe hundreds of millions of dollars all over the world taking care of ecosystems and weve got one in our backyard that is dying
7628961 what im interested in and what the state is interested in is how do we fix it
7628962 theres no sense in taking tristan along on the next crusade if he has to swallow even a dollop of hummus hell gag for an hour
7628963 which is the fear of having a phobia even though you may not have one at the moment
7628964 supposing i should be afraid of food i should starve to death not a very pretty picture you will admit
7628965 even if i should learn that the world would end tomorrow i would still plant this apple tree today
7628966 were all playing the parlor game of wwtt what would tim think
7628967 what would he say what would he do what would he have thought of the choice of biden who would he now think mccain has to choose he lived for this and these next few days in specific are what he lived for
7628968 he greatly enjoyed conventions he used to call them his superbowl as were election night coverages
7628969 he shored up the experience gap but will joe biden be gaffe free from now until the election
7628970 what utter bullshit double speak to explore long term enhancements to your capital structure what they did is just confirm that they have retained goldman sachs

7628979 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world

7628981 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really

7628992 i just couldnt take care of them all but i was trying to save them from being killed out of the kill shelters
7628993 its very easy for animal lovers who get involved in rescue to get in over their heads and for things to get a little bit out of control and unfortunately that was the situation
7628994 well ive been doing that for about the last month
7628995 it just takes time red tape with the state and the government
7628996 our plan is to work with her and try to get her to keep her numbers under control and keep things on the up and up so that the animals she does keep are maintained properly
7628997 it takes a lot of time a lot of effort but if you love them its no problem
7628998 theyll either all go through an adoption or through a rescue group
7628999 some of them are very sweet some of them have been abused
7629000 and i just need to find them a good home where they are no longer abused

7629397 holding the olympics was good in terms of china taking a more democratic path we believe this is an irreversible path
7629398 while the reformist open door policy is said to be making progress in china it is not always leaping forward
7629399 i think our friends in china have hosted a highly successful
7629400 lets remember that these games have been free of violence and this is a very uncertain world that we live in
7629401 i dont know of a single olympic games in recent history which has not generated controversy of one sort or another
7629402 when the chinese leadership sees the system questioned it does not respect basic freedoms as we know them that is why i am strictly against saying it is all good
7629403 the city has opened up and people are mixing like they did in moscow when i was there in 1980
7629404 it was maybe an opportunity missed for the chinese to demonstrate their willingness to be more open and to allow more
7629405 the chinese authorities and the ioc had an opportunity to demonstrate but in most respects they failed to deliver
7629406 forced evictions detention of activists and restrictions on journalists should not blight another olympics

7629415 the government forces still surround the camp there is no fighting now but tension is high throughout the camp
7629416 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7629417 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp there were many casualties up to now we have 27 confirmed dead and 75 wounded
7629418 government forces killed 25 idps this happened before the eyes of the hybrid force i urge the international community to protect idps
7629419 we called off regular patrols in kalma because it is not part of our mandate to search for arms and arrest individuals
7629420 shortly after we got calls from sheikhs who said those officers had already positioned themselves in the camp and that shots were fired
7629421 a unamid police and military force accessed the camp and we are prepared for possible assistance in the case of evacuating any type of casualties
7629422 these discussions continue as we have not yet finalised an agreement
7629423 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7629424 what i understand is that the iraqi parliament will not pass this agreement
7629425 at this moment the iraqi government and parliament are not ready for such a deal which will face a lot of hurdles
7629426 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and national interests of iraq
7629427 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and we cannot grant full immunity
7629428 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament

7629436 given what was happening in the community and the senate inquiry into the sexualisation of children in the media we considered that there had been a definite shift in community standards
7629437 there will always be certain hot points within the community that are of concern
7629438 the boards role is to walk the line between advertisers being able to advertise their product and the community not being offended

7629489 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7629498 sixty six percent of clinton supporters registered democrats who want clinton as the nominee are now backing obama
7629499 thats down from 75 percent in the end of june twenty seven percent of them now say theyll support mccain up from 16 percent in late june
7629500 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7629501 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7629502 there was too much discussion of her need to drop out of the race voters who were passionate about her and waiting to vote for her in primaries might have been discouraged
7629503 the fact that she stayed in the race probably made senator obama a better candidate
7629504 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7629505 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7629506 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7629507 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7629508 had not yet achieved the complete reconciliation that we need
7629509 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us
7629510 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message

7629530 my friends often ask me if catholics in genuinely good conscience can vote for a pro choice candidate the answer is i couldnt supporting a right to choose abortion simply masks and evades what abortion really is the deliberate killing of innocent life i know of nothing that can morally offset that kind of evil
7629531 one of the pillars of catholic thought is this dont deliberately kill the innocent and dont collude in allowing it we sin if we support candidates because they support a false right to abortion we sin if we support pro choice candidates without a truly proportionate reason for doing so that is a reason grave enough to outweigh our obligation to end the killing of the unborn and what would a proportionate reason look like it would be a reason we could with an honest heart expect the unborn victims of abortion to accept when we meet them and need to explain our actions as we someday will

7629546 in the past our community was a working class community people liked leftist ideals at that time
7629547 now we are entering into being a business community you see a lot of our community involved in small developments in the taxi industry in the trucking industry and in franchise businesses like subway and quiznos so now they like vision because with one hand they support labour and with the other hand they are supporting small business too

7629551 its not as bad as it used to be and i believe there is less prejudice in canada than in almost any other country including india but its never going to go away 100 per cent
7629552 for a long time there was this obsession with becoming an mp or an mla while civic office was somehow considered to be beneath our dignity
7629553 for example in many families the wife will get her canadian citizenship but the husband will not in order to preserve his rights back home in india
7629554 there is still some perceived stigma about the sikh community what you hear about sikhs in the mainstream media is often still very negative
7629555 the community is not as transparent joe and jane public have not been able to experience indo canadian culture in the same way that they have chinese culture the community is still very temple based
7629556 i think vancouver had finally reached a point where a majority of the people in our city speak a first language other than english
7629557 and as our diversity has increased people are starting to recognize that more important than skin colour is what you bring to the table what values what kind of work ethic

7629649 she gave us all the chance to know the baby boy shed already named
7629650 you know its so sad but sometimes the best leave us the first
7629651 the whole city was pulling for the baby but the odds were against him
7629652 ive worked on sad cases but this is the saddest
7629653 estamos a favor de que pemex pueda crecer con sus recursos
7629654 para ello los procuradores analizaremos las medidas legislativas ministeriales policiales y de reclusi n aplicables en cada uno de los estados y en la federaci n para hacer m s efectivo el combate a este lacerante delito
7629655 ciertamente que los niveles de violencia que se registran en ciudad ju rez son muy altos son inaceptables y esto obviamente obliga a que como lo hacemos cotidianamente podamos revisar los elementos t cticos de este operativo chihuahua

7629657 what do you do with an infant with pyloric stenosis
7629658 there are some very stark parallels between hip hop and the negro leagues
7629659 neither one was expected to survive but here we are how many years later and its one of the most influential types of music out there
7629660 nobody gave the negro leagues a chance but it lasted 40 years
7629661 its important in that the individuals were asking to work on the projects they need to see that theres a reason for it that goes beyond ego goes beyond making money goes beyond spending for marketing everything needs to be multifaceted now
7629662 when you started talking about buck oneil here was a man who knew charlie parker and ll cool j he was excited about this project for a man well into his 90s he never lost touch he was comfortable in any environment and had an appreciation for all art forms hip hop rock and roll in his estimation it was all jazz all jazz
7629663 the struggle for rap and urban music to be accepted in the music industry was similar to black players being acknowledged as players and not black people
7629664 theres a big gap between young people today understanding this and understanding how their struggles paralleled
7629665 we want them to make news based upon good things as opposed to a shootout at a club
7629666 one of the things we talked about was approaching young people about the project
7629667 how many times in your life do you truly have a chance to make history
7629668 so goes the dollar so goes the energy complex these days
7629669 the storm is trying to pull the market higher but its not getting much of a boost
7629670 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7629671 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7629672 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7629673 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7629674 codeine itself doesnt have any pain relieving effects but our body changes it into morphine and thats what combats the pain
7629675 the problem is that your genetic makeup makes more or less of it
7629676 so this is where the risk lies because you cant know in advance what that predisposition would be unless you would do a genetic test which is not standard routine at this point so while it would not be a problem in all cases i would say that codeine cannot be considered a safe drug for some mothers who are breast feeding their infants
7629677 the basic nature of this finding does not surprise me given that this is where science is going with a huge effort being made to better understand the interaction of ones genes with exposure to various substances and its not unheard of for this kind of science to lead to an altering of ob gyn practice it should be said for example that it wasnt so long ago in the 60s and 70s that women were actually given alcohol to stop premature labor so the possibility that this is true does create a burden to do the appropriate testing before we make such prescriptions
7629678 im done i will never support the democrat party again not after how they treated me

7629683 when you step off the plane in auckland it feels like everyones got pneumonia
7629684 youre just going through a patch at the present but the resurgence will come from the south or the provincial areas and will work its way up it will just be a matter of time
7629685 the public doesnt know the risk they are running by their everyday actions
7629686 simple negligence is something that might be charged if you are driving at the speed limit and blow a red light
7629687 gross negligence occurs when you have behavior verging on reckless without due regard for human life
7629688 every time i file one of these cases i think there but for the grace of god go all of us
7629689 i said i would plea bargain if it were my fault i could not even remember doing it
7629690 we did the best we could with what we had

7629698 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7629699 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7629700 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7629701 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7629702 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7629703 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7629704 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

7629708 this is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development transportation planning and environmental policies
7629709 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
7629710 health risk can be mitigated through proper urban planning but that doesnt erase the immediate risk to school age children attending schools that are too close to highways right now
7629711 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants

7629725 was supposed to be the battering ram that would break the republican hold on the white house the core of the case democrats intended to make that his administration had been a disaster like no other in history vietnam cubed when bush doubled down with the surge in early 2007 democrats placed a huge bet on failure and sat back to enjoy and cash in their winnings speaker of the house nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid released a joint letter that said a surge would be useless senators joe biden and chuck hagel introduced a resolution opposing the buildup votes of no confidence followed in rapid succession we are going to pick up seats as a result of this war reid exulted democrats in the senate spent much of their time forcing a series of votes designed to get their opponents on record as backing the war and the president in june 2007 reid declared the war lost
7629726 for obama his vote on the surge is quite a complication and one that he never foresaw

7629746 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7629747 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7629748 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7629749 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7629750 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7629751 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7629752 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7629753 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7629754 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7629755 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7629756 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7629757 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

7629851 there is never any order to the contrary orders are always there to use minimum
7629852 it is the specific duty of the leaders to gain an ever clearer understanding of the theoretical problems to free themselves more and more from the influence of traditional phrases inherited from the old conception of the world and constantly to keep in mind that socialism having become a science demands the same treatment as every other science it must be studied
7629853 the notion in 68 that a black person or a woman might have a serious shot at the presidency would have been widely viewed as lunacy

7629882 hold down the home key for 5 7 seconds when in the mail app
7629883 i was flat out told that this is how the iphone behaves and nothing is wrong every time it changes wifi networks it has to establish its email port 25 over and over again and so it will not connect to the next network it finds until you restart your iphone
7629884 where were you sent you an email you missed the meeting

7629890 team the launch of mobileme was not our finest hour there are several things we could have done better mobileme was simply not up to apples standards it clearly needed more time and testing rather than launch mobileme as a monolithic service we could have launched over the air syncing with iphone to begin with followed by the web applications one by one mail first followed 30 days later if things went well with mail by calendar then 30 days later by contacts it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence we are taking many steps to learn from this experience so that we can grow mobileme into a service that our customers will love one step that i can share with you today is that the mobileme team will now report to eddy cue who will lead all of our internet services itunes the app store and starting today mobileme eddys new title will be vice president internet services and he will now report directly to me yes i have had many many issues since upgrading my gen1 4gb phone to 2 0 email does not download properly from my pop3 server several accounts message previews dont show up consistently selecting a message from inbox results in endless spinning status indicator s very often and no message body showing up even after several minutes of spinning status indicator and no errors indicated either the emails have no attachments in most cases and are 1 2 pages so maybe 4 8k max in size networking in general seems to have been tanked by 2 0 the range of the wi fi seems less and the cellphone signal seems weaker than it was in the past fewer bars in general the edge egprs network access seems much slower too which is hard to do this release really seems to be a huge pos thats been my experience apple over i am so upset since i expected the normal apple quality and got ms quality instead oh to the apple zealots i dont want to see a single reply to this about how your phone was upgraded offline and works great or any of that crap i upgraded the phone with itunes online just like all the other updates if there was a better undocumented preference for upgrading the phone offline and this obscure method was the result of some de developing the upgrade process by doing offline upgrades during regression testing that from a software consistency qa and ease of use standpoint is incredibly lame and nothing but shear incompetence they should go work for ms to think someone will second guess the online update vs offline method is ludicrous and extremely bone headed the upgrade should work identically regardless of method used clear on that one zealots i do know what software development is difficult particularly when looking for bugs and trying to fix things but i agree that apple definitely dropped the ball on this one just like how steve jobs sent an email out to his employees about waiting for the introduction of mobileme well they should had made absolutely sure and positive that the 2 0 update was working stable none of that clunky lagging scrolling text messaging contact scrolling broken email lost weak signal etc etc crap oh well i too know how difficult design engineering can be since i worked at another unix platform company for 8 years doing design engineering and program management a really bright company i know how the process works and i know how the marketing pucks will push p1s1s out the door despite being out voted in the pm release meetings i hate to see apple do it to themselves again they changed the industry with the iphone just look at all the korean amp japanese knock offs coming out almost every month since july 2007 i would hate to see a replay of the 80s when arrogance in marketing resulted in a lost opportunity and 150b in billy gs pockets i spent 15 years in the valley from 1985 to 2000 i used to see wozniak at the original pancake house in saratoga nearly every saturday or sunday in the late 80s early 90s they apple have had mobile phones on their minds for quite sometime because back in 1990 wozniak had a home made wrist watch based cellphone he used a timex calculator watch or similar for the keypad and display had an earpiece and the guts of the phone on his belt in a 4x4x2
7629891 my iphone has been running stable for 12 hours my iphone has been running stable for 12 hours
7629892 oh no i have one of those expensive iphone things youve probably heard about in the news yeah and its not working properly
7629893 oh it hangs up just force quit it and it should be fine
7629894 may be due to an account not being able to fetch or push email
7629895 sorry while we understand that is a problem it will unfortunately have to be fixed in a later update
7629896 apple promises 3g iphone problems will be fixed in september

7629913 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7629914 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7629915 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7629916 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7629917 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message

7629919 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7629920 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7629921 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7629922 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7629923 clinton herself has suggested that the party needs a cathartic moment to cleanse any remaining bad blood between the two camps

7629987 it has been an extremely difficult decision to take given my burning desire to represent europe again in defending the ryder cup in the united states
7629988 but the fact that boston this week is my only opportunity to qualify for the final two play off events as well as being my final opportunity to play my 15 events on the us pga tour conflicts with my ambition to play gleneagles and earn my spot in the team
7629989 i have called nick faldo and told him of my decision and hope that my performance so far this year will earn one of his two wild card picks
7629990 the captains picks are a nightmare and not a position i would have wanted where i need one but we do know that nick will do the right thing and i will be playing as hard as i can this week to add to my year and hopefully earn one
7629991 hes shown he is a big time player and thats the type you want in the ryder cup
7629992 i hope to tee up with monty hes a different man when it comes to the ryder cup and everyone wants to play with him in the foursomes and the fourballs
7629993 hes an obvious person to have leading the way he comes up with his best golf when hes out first whereas im one of those who play the same whether you send me out first seventh or 12th
7629994 i can see myself taking over montys role at some point but im only just getting out of the situation of feeling like a kid on the team
7629995 its hard to see either one of us opening up a big lead there
