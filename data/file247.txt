2470023 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2470024 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2470025 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2470026 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2470027 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2470028 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2470029 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2470030 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2470031 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2470032 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth

2470036 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2470037 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe

2470041 are nervous about obama not just because hes african american but because hes new in so many ways
2470042 when was the last time you saw a campaign run on social security and medicare
2470043 i expect youll see mccain do well with older voters not because of his age but because of his politics
2470044 obama has an incredibly compelling story to tell women in terms of his background his own economic struggle his single mom going to school relating to their concerns
2470045 who is spreading that vicious rumor that women my age white haired and all dont support you
2470046 if youre a betting person and you look at the numbers and the fact that most pardons have landed in december i think there is every reason to expect there are some pardons ahead

2470057 i just said of course im gay and carried on with my work its not a big deal to me im sure i could make a complaint to the personnel department about harassment or something but it wouldnt get me anywhere my boss doesnt mind anyway he just wanted to know
2470058 i was getting a price on a deal from one of the traders recently when the trader suddenly sneered at me and said im not used to working with gays i guess the news had spread
2470059 i simply said well im not used to working with arseholes and walked off since then no ones mentioned it
2470060 09 08 2008 israel is battling hard to overturn a spanish courts decision to issue arrest warrants against six current and former politicians and senior military officials a source in the office told the jerusalem post on thursday late last month audiencia nacional the national court of spain the highest spanish judicial council issued arrest warrants against the six binyamin ben eliezer doron almog moshe yaalon dan halutz giora eiland and mike herzog accepting a petition from the palestinian center for human rights that suggested they were guilty of war crimes in the gaza strip during the summer of 2002 at that time ben eliezer was serving as a defense minister yaalon was army chief of general staff eiland headed the national security council halutz was commander of the iaf almog was oc southern command and herzog was a senior defense ministry official the plaintiffs claimed that ben eliezer personally oversaw the killing of hamas commander salah shehadeh in which the foreign ministry has said only that the matter is being taken care of however the post quoted a source in the office as saying that active negotiations between madrid and jerusalem are taking place to overturn the warrants this is not the first time that pchr has filed suit against high ranking israeli military commanders but if the courts decision is not reversed it will set a disturbing precedent in international law said ofer zalzberg co chairman of yifc young israeli forum for cooperation an organization that promotes relations between israel and the european union zalzberg recalled a 2005 incident in which almog travelling to london stayed in his plane upon arrival in london rather than risk arrest shortly thereafter a british warrant for his arrest was revoked we are talking about several people and a very significant and drastic step it might also cause a shower of law suits from various groups and individuals in europe against various israeli officials
2470061 i dont think the decision of the spanish court indicates a crisis in israel eu relations but it seems that these elements exploit the law in these countries to act against the state of israel

2470074 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2470075 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2470076 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2470077 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade

2470082 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2470083 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
2470084 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

2470098 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2470099 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2470100 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2470101 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2470102 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2470103 cest une comp tition entre dop s qui se font prendre et dop s qui ne se font pas prendre
2470104 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2470105 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2470106 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2470133 i am naturally confident if i believe in my own ability i dont see anything else in the field i had in mind i had done well in australia and might get a chance soon
2470134 the way i approached the game changed that day i just had one thing in my mind that i have to play for my country and live that dream for my dad
2470135 my first reaction was of absolute joy i could hardly believe it
2470136 a plus point was the chief selector was there i hadnt done as well as id wanted to in the indian premier league so i knew this tournament was an important opportunity it was pressure to have the chairman watching me against tough opposition but once i started doing well i grew more confident about my batting
2470137 dilip sir asked me to keep doing what i do i knew he had been observing me for sometime now and i hope i can live up to his expectations
2470138 he is a very physical type of player he likes to impose himself on the game backs it up with his skill
2470139 i cant be bogged down by a bowler i just like to give it back
2470140 i was asked to open the innings which i dont usually but i remained unbeaten on 120 and helped india win
2470141 he was disappointed that on a couple of occasions he didnt get as many runs as he should have simply because he had wanted to get a reasonable amount of runs a little bit too early therefore we agreed he should be looking to bat into the 40th over
2470142 he just told me to recognise my strong areas during the game and go for the shots i felt confident of and could pull off
2470143 i am naturally confident if i believe in my own ability i dont see anything else in the field i had in mind i had done well in australia and might get a chance soon
2470144 should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket
2470145 good morning im john mccain as you may know the democratic national convention is just a couple of weeks away it was four years ago at the same gathering that america heard a fine speech from an illinois state senator named barack obama hes done pretty well for himself since then and the smart money in denver is on another celebrated performance
2470146 but even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall in the way of running mates senator obama should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket
2470147 in the meantime let me take a stab at a plot summary of the obama campaign america is finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit government is too big and he wants to grow it taxes are too high and he wants to raise them congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it
2470148 energy in particular seems to confound senator obama because if there is any problem that cant be solved by words alone its americas need for secure and affordable energy supplies so far hes managed to come up with an energy plan thats so timid only opec and a few interest groups in his own party are happy with it and this week senator obama set about correcting that impression
2470149 first there was his call for americans to check their tires which is commonsense advice but hardly has the makings of a national energy strategy if we cant drill our way out of the problem it seems even more unlikely that we can inflate our way out of it
2470150 next came senator obamas mention of offshore drilling formerly known in the obama campaign as a
2470151 apparently senator obama was trying to get credit for changing his mind on drilling without actually changing his position against drilling this was the rare case of a politician actually hoping to be accused of a flip flop but even that would be giving senator obamas energy plan too much credit as of today he still has no plan to produce more oil by drilling offshore and my opponents most memorable flip flop remains his frequent criticism of the bush cheney energy policy despite voting for the bush cheney energy bill in 2005 a bill i opposed and voted against
2470152 finally senator obama proposed to release oil from our nations strategic petroleum reserve for those keeping track this comes exactly a month after he said he was firmly against using the strategic petroleum reserve
2470153 a serious energy plan involves a lot more yess than nos and that is why i say yes to drilling here and now yes to 45 more nuclear power plants to provide our country with electricity yes to clean coal technology so that we can create jobs and use americas most abundant resource yes to renewable energy sources so that we can shift away from petroleum over the long term yes to a break from the federal gasoline tax so that our government helps you in a time of need instead of just adding to your costs in short yes to all of the above to a bold plan for achieving energy independence that starts today
2470154 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation
2470155 this year were probably going to surpass 2007 easily just given the way were starting
2470156 the yakima valley is a huge player these are big operations that are difficult to track down
2470157 they use fictitious names they put property in daughters wives names to conceal identity and try to thwart law enforcement from going forward with civil forfeiture
2470158 i suspect after youve had numerous busts somebodys future plan for growing pot in vineyards is going to be thwarted
2470159 could be a problem because you never know what mood the judges are in they havent had time for a wine yet
2470160 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2470161 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2470162 in my position as someone who has won many grand slams it ranks right up there with the grand slams
2470163 the sydney olympics were my first olympic games and it was a very good tournament for me as i finished fourth and just missed out on a medal so it was going to be one of my dreams to do well at an olympic games to be able to represent my country is something that is very important to me
2470164 last time i had the honour to carry the flag and it was one of those moments you only dream about to walk into the stadium with the swiss flag and see the athletes on one side and the fans on the other side it was one of the great moments of my career
2470165 eight years ago meeting my girlfriend at the olympic games was a highlight of my career carrying the flag was a different highlight of my career i dont know what was nicer but i guess meeting my girlfriend weve been together for eight years while carrying the flag was only for 10 minutes so ill pick 2000 as better
2470166 the last couple of weeks have not been the best
2470167 i think ive lost matches i should never have lost and in a way it hurts but at the same time i didnt play badly in losing
2470168 and you know toronto and cincinnati are not the tournaments that are going to make me cry for months and months its really the us open and olympics that matter to me at this point in my career anything positive that comes now winning the olympic games or the us open would help my confidence a lot as well as making this season a very good one obviously i know that people expect more of me after the last five years
2470169 i went over there the other day and its really nice it has the olympic feel but it is not possible really to stay there i cannot escape in there because the other athletes want pictures and everything
2470170 i dont mind it but when it is happening every day it means its not the ideal preparation for trying to win a gold medal
2470171 i went through it in sydney and athens and had great experiences and know what the olympic games are all about i have the option to go back to the village or not im trying to have it the perfect way this time around
2470172 this will probably be my most unique birthday of all time unless i have a baby on my birthday but we have no plans yet
2470173 this is very special im thrilled its the opening ceremony on my birthday and i get to carry the flag for switzerland and obviously you can imagine what that means to me i hope i enjoy the moment as much as i can i hope i dont stumble when i walk into the stadium i hope i have a nice day and a nice cake and im going to take a day off
2470174 but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2470175 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007
2470176 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2470177 admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2470178 the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown but now the truth is out and the repair work that began in 2006 will continue
2470179 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2470180 i had a headache this morning i felt very bad i couldnt imagine how i would shoot feeling this bad
2470181 especially since its the first gold medal of the olympics i feel amazing
2470182 as for the final i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2470183 im more proud of her than if i was to do it myself
2470184 i did my part i mean half of my job is done
2470185 i know i would do good even if he wasnt here if he couldnt be here for some reason i know he would do great if i wasnt here for him
2470186 an integral part of thai culture is the responsibility and need to provide happiness after an hour of lovemaking nobody says was it good for you they say are you happy this illusion is part of the desire to create happiness for those who visit if you dont lose your head its a wonderful experience
2470187 i work as a volunteer in whistler village and im always looking for things that non athletic people can do
2470188 you could whack off a limb with one of those
2470189 our elders tell us they always wanted to see the weaving tradition come back and are proud to see their grandchildren weaving
2470190 so its great to show them how we really live we wear our native regalia and sing native songs but we also live in the modern world
2470191 i teach in the local school system and ive always been eager to learn about native culture so i think this place is wonderful

2470385 we have not been provided with the evidence that would show us that this is an impossibility nor does it answer the question of why arent we working on this for next time
2470386 the point is the law needs to be adhered to and the governor is saying we need to follow the law and if the controller is saying its inconvenient i think the controller needs to explain why inconvenience is a reason to ignore the law
2470387 its certainly not a language that is taught oftentimes you have to rely on retired annuitants to come back and help maintain the system until youre able to find a replacement

2470395 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

2470404 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself nameless unreasoning unjustified terror
2470405 every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired in a final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed

2470407 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen

2470409 a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people

2470411 government is not reason it is not eloquent it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master

2470414 irfan menyarankan saya untuk mundur saya sendiri memang sudah memikirkan langkah mundur itu jika usulan saya tidak diterima ketika saya menyampaikan pengunduran diri pertengahan juli lalu sebagian besar penggurus menyetujuinya
2470415 beliau memang menyatakan sebelumnya telah keluar dari mmi secara total sehingga tidak ada alasan bagi kami untuk mengundang hadir
2470416 memang kami mendengar beliau mau membuat jamaah baru silakan saja itu bagus bagus saja
2470417 perwakilan seluruh indonesia hadir kecuali yang tidak hadir memang izin tidak bisa hadir
2470418 siapa saja calon yang akan diajukan jadi ahlul hali wal aqdi nanti akan pilih

2470420 ustad abu meminta pengubahan pasal di mmi tapi lajnah tanfidziah dewan tanfidz menolak jika tetap diusulkan nanti akan ada laskar yang menghadang
2470421 karena selama ini ustad hanya diposisikan sebagai koordinator dewan syuro sedangkan pelaksana tugas sehari hari adalah dewan tanfidz jadi kalau boleh disenadakan dengan pkb ustad itu kayak gus dur tapi kalau di pkb gus dur begitu berperan kalau di mmi ustad hanya sebagai simbol jadi dewan tanfidz itu sangat dominan
2470422 jadi kalau ustad diminta laporan pertanggungjawaban ya saya pikir salah alamat karena selama ini ustad tidak pernah mengeluarkan program dan pemikiran dia selama ini hanya berdakwah
2470423 yang benar bukan tidak seusai syariat islam tapi tidak sesuai dengan keinginan beliau baasyir
2470424 tidak bisa hanya dengan satu orang saja orang akan tahu mana yang taat dan mana yang tidak siapa atau organisasi apa yang membela dia saat mau ditahan dipenjara hingga dibebaskan pada tahun 2006
2470425 dengan demikian selama ini dia sudah menjalankan fungsi kepemimpinannya atau belum

2470427 penyebutan saya sebagai amir itu hanya pinjam istilah saja sedangkan fungsinya hanya simbol sebagai seorang yang disebut amir saya tidak punya wewenang apa apa untuk ambil keputusan karena pengambilan keputusan harus suara mayoritas padahal seharusnya semua keputusan di tangan amir
2470428 saya tetap berpendapat bahwa sesuai hadits sebuah organisasi harus dipimpin seorang amir yang secara efektif menjalankan tugasnya tidak ada batasan apakah organisasi itu telah memegang kekuasaan politik ataupun belum karena mereka bersikeras maka saya memilih mundur

2470433 onveilige seks met iemand uit n van deze landen verhoogt dus de kans op een hiv infectie of een soa
2470434 veel jongeren komen dan ook met een soa terug van vakantie of maken zich tijdens of na de vakantie zorgen dat ze misschien iets hebben opgelopen of zwanger zijn daarbij komt nog dat bijna de helft van de jongeren die geen relatie hebben geen pakje condooms meeneemt dat is de reden dat we hier staan we geven voorlichting over veilig vrijen en voor iedereen hebben we gratis condooms
2470435 in the wake of the outbreak of the russian georgian war over ossetia georgia wants to withdraw the 2 000 troops it has in iraq these troops appear to have been based in diyala or wasit provinces where they have been preventing shiite militiamen from smuggling arms in from iran although the us military is playing down the impact of their withdrawal it seems to me significant the iraqi army certainly could not be counted on to take up their work since so much of it was recruited from shiite militias the us would have to divert 2 000 men to this dangerous task and it is intrinsically dangerous to have us troops directly on the iranian border the georgians beefed up their presence because they are trying to join nato from a russian point of view this development is highly undesirable which is part of the point of the fighting over ossetia all this is not to mention that a us airlift of 2000 georgian troops to fight russian ones at this juncture does not look friendly to moscow

2470445 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2470446 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2470447 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all

2470458 this is a parish that does exactly what the holy father tells us to do celebrating the mass reverently in the old and new forms the bishop is determined to squash it and to destroy me because he doesnt want me moving to another parish and doing the same thing
2470459 the bishop told me some time ago that he wanted me to say mass facing the people and that because he had told me what to do it was therefore the will of the holy spirit
2470460 the bishop believes your ministry to be divisive is uncertain that ordinary pastoral care of parishioners is taking place and does not have confidence that you will celebrate the ordinary form of the mass with a generous heart for the vast majority of parishioners who expect sunday and weekday masses to be in english and at an altar facing the people

2470464 they were wearing dark clothing including hooded tops and made off in a dark hatchback car
2470465 it is possible the offenders were in the area in the days leading up to the burglary so if anyone saw persons or vehicles in the area that they did not recognise i would ask them to also get in touch

2470480 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
2470481 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
2470482 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
2470483 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2470484 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2470485 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2470486 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2470487 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2470488 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2470489 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2470490 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2470491 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2470492 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2470493 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2470494 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2470495 mad she was angry furious would be a good way to describe it
2470496 she should not be involved in protecting me from whatever the consequences of this are
2470497 my lord and my wife have forgiven me and so im going to move on i think our marriage will not only survive it will be strong

2470501 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2470502 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2470503 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it

2470509 the finding was focussed on undermining irans nuclear ambitions and trying to undermine the government through regime change
2470510 well create generations of jihadists and our grandchildren will be battling our enemies here in america
2470511 at least ten senior flag and general officers including combatant commanders
2470512 attacking them as a means to get to that spot strikes me as being not the first choice
2470513 too many people believe you have to be either for or against the iranians
2470514 lets get serious eighty million people live there and everyones an individual the idea that theyre only one way or another is nonsense
2470515 did i bitch about some of the things that were being proposed you bet some of them were very stupid
2470516 the process is broken and this is dangerous stuff were authorizing
2470517 the c i a needed the finding to do its traditional stuff but the finding does not apply to jsoc the president signed an executive order after september 11th giving the pentagon license to do things that it had never been able to do before without notifying congress the claim was that the military was preparing the battle space and by using that term they were able to circumvent congressional oversight everything is justified in terms of fighting the global war on terror
2470518 the administration has been fuzzing the lines there used to be a shade of gray
2470519 the agency says were not going to get in the position of helping to kill people without a finding
2470520 the over all authorization includes killing but its not as though thats what theyre setting out to do its about gathering information enlisting support
2470521 the executive branch understands that we are not trying to dictate what they do
2470522 we are simply trying to see to it that what they do is consistent with american values and will not get the country in trouble
2470523 i suspect theres something going on but i dont know what to believe cheney has always wanted to go after iran and if he had more time hed find a way to do it we still dont get enough information from the agencies and i have very little confidence that they give us information on the edge
2470524 is just that notification and not a sign off on activities proper oversight of ongoing intelligence activities is done by fully briefing the members of the intelligence committee
2470525 as a rule we dont comment one way or the other on allegations of covert activities or purported findings
2470526 it will take another year before we get the intelligence activities under control
2470527 we control the money and they cant do anything without the money money is what its all about but im very leery of this administration
2470528 theyve been absolutely unhelpful very damaging and i absolutely dont condone any of their activities and i have yet to see anything since ive been in this job in the way of a public action by iran thats been at all helpful in this region
2470529 when i arrived at centcom the iranians were funding every entity inside iraq it was in their interest to get us out and so they decided to kill as many americans as they could and why not they didnt know whod come out ahead but they wanted us out i decided that i couldnt resolve the situation in iraq without the neighborhood to get this problem in iraq solved we had to somehow involve iran and syria i had to work the neighborhood
2470530 it would happen only if the iranians did something stupid
2470531 one of the reasons the white house selected fallon for centcom was that hes known to be a strategic thinker and had demonstrated those skills in the pacific
2470532 he was charged with coming up with an over all coherent strategy for iran iraq and afghanistan and by law the combatant commander is responsible for all military operations within his a
2470533 when fallon tried to make sense of all the overt and covert activity conducted by the military in his area of responsibility a small group in the white house leadership shut him out
2470534 the coherence of military strategy is being eroded because of undue civilian influence and direction of nonconventional military operations
2470535 if you have small groups planning and conducting military operations outside the knowledge and control of the combatant commander by default you cant have a coherent military strategy you end up with a disaster like the reconstruction efforts in iraq
2470536 fox said that theres a lot of strange stuff going on in special ops and i told him he had to figure out what they were really doing
2470537 the special ops guys eventually figured out they needed fox and so they began to talk to him fox would have won his fight with special ops but for cheney
2470538 fallon went down because in his own way he was trying to prevent a war with iran and you have to admire him for that
2470539 is very open in describing the killings going on inside the country
2470540 a controlled press which makes it more important that it publishes these things we begin to see inside the government
2470541 hardly a day goes by now we dont see a clash somewhere there were three or four incidents over a recent weekend and the iranians are even naming the revolutionary guard officers who have been killed
2470542 this is the ultimate for the iranians to blame the c i a
2470543 this is new and its an escalation a ratcheting up of tensions
2470544 in gardiners view the violence rather than weakening irans religious government may generate support for it
2470545 weve got exposure because of the transfer of our weapons and our communications gear the iranians will be able to make the argument that the opposition was inspired by the americans how many times have we tried this without asking the right questions is the risk worth it
2470546 just because lebanon iraq and pakistan have ethnic problems it does not mean that iran is suffering from the same issue
2470547 iran is an old country like france and germany and its citizens are just as nationalistic the u s is overestimating ethnic tension in iran
2470548 you can always find some activist groups that will go and kill a policeman but working with the minorities will backfire and alienate the majority of the population
2470549 the baluchis are sunni fundamentalists who hate the regime in tehran but you can also describe them as al qaeda
2470550 these are guys who cut off the heads of nonbelievers in this case its shiite iranians the irony is that were once again working with sunni fundamentalists just as we did in afghanistan in the nineteen eighties
2470551 this is a vicious salafi organization whose followers attended the same madrassas as the taliban and pakistani extremists
2470552 they are suspected of having links to al qaeda and they are also thought to be tied to the drug culture
2470553 the new task force will work with the m e k the administration is desperate for results
2470554 the m e k has no c p a auditing the books and its leaders are thought to have been lining their pockets for years if people only knew what the m e k is getting and how much is going to its bank accounts and yet it is almost useless for the purposes the administration intends
2470555 malikis increasingly choosing the interests of iraq over the interests of the united states
2470556 seem to be harming relations with the governments of both iraq and pakistan and could well be strengthening the connection between tehran and baghdad
2470557 the program works because its small and smart guys are running it
2470558 we have to be really careful in calling in the missiles we have to hit certain houses at certain times the people on the ground are watching through binoculars a few hundred yards away and calling specific locations in latitude and longitude we keep the predator loitering until the targets go into a house and we have to make sure our guys are far enough away so they dont get hit
2470559 the special ops guys are pissed off because cheneys office set up priorities for categories of targets and now hes getting impatient and applying pressure for results but it takes a long time to get the right guys in place
2470560 weve had wonderful results in the horn of africa with the use of surrogates and false flags basic counterintelligence and counter insurgency tactics and were beginning to tie them in knots in afghanistan but the white house is going to kill the program if they use it to go after iran its one thing to engage in selective strikes and assassinations in waziristan and another in iran the white house believes that one size fits all but the legal issues surrounding extrajudicial killings in waziristan are less of a problem because al qaeda and the taliban cross the border into afghanistan and back again often with u s and nato forces in hot pursuit the situation is not nearly as clear in the iranian case all the considerations judicial strategic and political are different in iran
2470561 there is huge opposition inside the intelligence community to the idea of waging a covert war inside iran and using baluchis and ahwazis as surrogates the leaders of our special operations community all have remarkable physical courage but they are less likely to voice their opposition to policy iran is not waziristan
2470562 yes its more serious than we have seen but to put it in context we do interact with the iranian revolutionary guard and their navy regularly
2470563 i didnt get the sense from the reports i was receiving that there was a sense of being afraid of these five boats
2470564 the subject was how to create a casus belli between tehran and washington
2470565 be possible to freeze the iranian nuclear program for the duration of the negotiations to avoid a military confrontation before they are completed should this newest attempt fail things will soon get serious deadly serious
2470566 the proposal says that the iranians must stop manufacturing new centrifuges and the other side will stop all further sanction activities in the u n security council
2470567 this could be acceptable to the iranians if they have good will
2470568 i think the americans are deeply divided on the issue of what to do about iran
2470569 some officials are concerned about the fallout from a military attack and others think an attack is unavoidable i know the europeans but i have no idea where the americans will end up on this issue
2470570 i could write a better book than the one i just bought

2470601 i am very pleased to report that all exercise objectives have been met

2470603 you cant always keep saying well im gaining experience im gaining experience there is a time to start believing this is the time to do it the time is now
2470604 its a bit of a catch 22 i think experience in majors is essential just the environment the golf course and i think the art of patience in majors is the key
2470605 he was the most coolest humblest dude ive ever seen it was a trip

2470609 you might notice she will shift her body in the same direction as yours or take your lead for behavior changes like picking up a glass to drink or blinking her eyes repeatedly if youre doing so
2470610 if you want to test her lean forward and see if she comes closer too
2470611 then isaiah son of amoz sent a message to hezekiah this is what the lord the god of israel says because you have prayed to me concerning sennacherib king of assyria 22 this is the word the lord has spoken against him

2470624 i often think that religion even if there is a higher power has caused more earthly harm than good over the years
2470625 oh how i hate you for doing this but im gonna grow up and then well see whos gonna have the last word
2470626 for example lets say you manually specify a width of 400px for an image if one day you decide to change your theme post area to display 500px worth of content suddenly all your images are too small to fix the problem you most likely have to go through and manually edit every img html tags to change the width
2470627 have you ever tried saying hello to somebody listening to an ipod if i see the white or black wires sticking out of somebodys ears i dont even bother even if its a friend again in crowded public spaces this may be a desirable outcome
2470628 6 out of 10 in a moderately noisy environment and if i turned it on without checking first if the volume had been accidentally moved to the max then my ear drums would feel like they were going to explode maybe this is proof of hearing loss who knows
2470629 but i suspect there are those who use mp3s and ipods and a means to limit social interaction or at least have become comfortable with that secondary outcome
2470630 i want to get off every friday at 2 to be with my family and want 4 weeks of vacation right away
2470631 theres one at the mall near my house we can go together
2470632 all i ever need to know i learned in kindergarten
2470633 1 that i had it set to from my previous nights in bed enjoyment of pink floyds
2470634 itll be sad when the new generation wont know how to write a letter
2470635 nothing like walking down the sidewalk trying to smile or say hello to someone who doesnt even know you are passing them by
2470636 i think the problem is technology not just ipods but texting facebook myspace and laptops
2470637 despite the prevalence of social networks cell phones emails and all this endless technology that was meant to bring people together i somehow have this feeling lately like we are actually moving backwards
2470638 i think even in my own life there was a time when i used to pick up the phone to call friends every couple of days and now with instant messaging and email i find that i rarely have the impulse to its guess its just far easier to send an email
2470639 if were not careful our generation may ultimately be remembered as the one that strolled through life with our heads down and our earbuds in a generation of people oblivious to all sounds except for that faint static we made ourselves
2470640 these devices are indiscriminate and target all children and young people including babies regardless of whether they are behaving or misbehaving
2470641 what type of society uses a low level sonic weapon on its children imagine the outcry if a device was introduced that caused blanket discomfort to people of one race or gender rather than to our kids
2470642 the mosquito has no place in a country that values its children and seeks to instill them with dignity and respect
2470643 if ever there was a device which highlighted the terrible way in which young people are treated in society then this is it since when did standing in an area become a crime
2470644 its quite possible they might pull out a soccer ball and start playing and who knows what else
2470645 why didnt you stay out longer and catch more fish
2470646 with this i have more than enough to support my familys needs
2470647 but what do you do with the rest of your time
2470648 i sleep late fish a little play with my children take siesta with my wife maria stroll into the village each evening where i sip wine and play guitar with my amigos i have a full and busy life
2470649 i can help you you should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds buy a bigger boat with the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor eventually opening your own cannery you would control the product processing and distribution you could leave this small coastal fishing village and move to mexico city then los angeles and eventually new york where you could run your ever expanding enterprise
2470650 thats the best part when the time is right you would sell your company stock to the public and become very rich you would make millions
2470651 with this i have more than enough to support my familys needs
2470652 what shall we wear for after all these things the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knows that you need all these things but seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be provided you

2470662 he took a look around the emergency room and found it was unacceptable crowding in one particular area where he wanted to have free access and egress in the event of a fire or a problem
2470663 he said you cant operate like this you cant have people in the hallway this is a bottleneck
2470664 this is the outcome of the cuts to the acute care beds in the fraser health and vancouver coastal health authorities and the closure of st marys hospital in new westminster
2470665 the provincial government cut 650 acute care beds and the campbell government got rid of st marys hospital to build condominiums
2470666 if hollywood could order intellectual property laws for christmas what would they look like this is pretty close

2470673 actually youre obligated to give over our personal encryption keys for even encrypted volumes if you dont comply theyll confiscate your computer and deny you entry
2470674 media and entertainment companies should limit the licensing of characters to healthier foods and drinks
2470675 adopt meaningful nutrition standards for the foods that are sold there
2470676 companies cease all in school promotion of products that dont meet such standards
2470677 companies that market food and drinks to children should expand public outreach efforts to educate children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise with particular attention aimed at minority populations that are disproportionately affected by childhood obesity
2470678 so people that earn a living have to pay for service and those who dont get it free
2470679 some of you are writers some painters some singers some photographers all with a medium available to voice your frustrations with the world or inspire the change you want to see in it and if you believe in something enough whether its climate change or something else theres really nothing stopping you from making a difference or making yourself heard
2470680 blame is useless what we need is to take responsibility and there is no such thing as taking 10 responsibility we need to figure out how we contribute to the problem and work to remedy that
2470681 for the past 100 years weve lived better than the richest kings of history
2470682 please im a moron give me some clear signs from history

2470687 i think the olympics are a good thing for china but for me if its not on its not on if it is it is i dont care hong kong isnt really involved
2470688 an earthquake an international accomplishment then were all chinese together but the rest of the time theyre very very careful to define themselves as from hong kong
2470689 theres certainly a feeling for china there was such sympathy after the earthquake
2470690 in hong kong we can do this in china no
2470691 the government has tried administrative measures to limit our activities or our space but there are no laws
2470692 but were better together as one like one big family hong kong couldnt survive without china
2470693 im not such a sports fan but i feel that there are a lot of changes for people in hong kong and china
2470694 there are such high expectations everyones scared something might go wrong

2470697 this seems to me to be an attack upon the state itself the monarch is the one embodiment of the state which is outside the political partisan process the people behind this campaign must either oppose the idea of anyone who is non partisan having a role in the affairs of state or they would rather be swearing allegiance to brussels

2470709 demand for gold has been resilient to global market conditions

2470723 ayatollah khamanei who is the strongest person in irans political structure has not been taking any fatal decisions at least in terms of foreign policy in the last two years
2470724 more than that he has tried to use a policy of ambiguity and agitation to buy more time in order to fulfill his goals
2470725 for example his top foreign policy consultant ali akbar velaiati in an article published on many european journals highlights the role of supreme leader and images ahmadinezhad as the less important figure
2470726 on the other hand in a speech immediately after that he introduces mahmood ahmadinezhad as the key player
2470727 in iran those who have the power do not make decisions and those who can make decisions do not have the power
2470728 he views the continuation of his current policies while not getting in to any kind of conflict with u s or israel as his main challenge
2470729 and this is the exact policy that leads westerns to a condition of intoleration desperation and moving towards harder measures
2470730 the rising nuclear crisis insecurity in iraq and problems in lebanon and occupied parts of palestine has made it harder and harder for israel u s and other western countries to accept the continuation of these policies
2470731 ayatollah khamenei considers the pre 9 11 policies still practical but the regional and global equations have changed since then
2470732 we havent seen indications or any concrete evidence that iran is building a nuclear weapon and ive been saying that consistently for the last five years
2470733 verification and enforcement of the non proliferation objectives contained in the npt are limited in part to maintain the balance of rights and obligations of states parties npt safeguards administered by the international atomic energy agency iaea are limited to verifying that no nuclear material in each non weapon state has been diverted to weapons or unknown use these safeguards allow for the iaea to report a case of non compliance to the security council only if nuclear material is found to have been diverted
2470734 under a traditional view the authority of the security council is limited to cases which have been found to constitute a threat to international peace and security
2470735 threat to peace breach of peace or act of aggression
2470736 it calls into question the legitimacy of the security council in intruding on matters of enforcing treaty law on matters that do not rise to the level of threat to the peace
2470737 israel will attack iran if it doesnt abandon its nuclear program
2470738 if there wont be a choice other than a nuclear iran or a military option its clear what our decision has to be
2470739 there is no military political or moral justification to initiate war with iran
2470740 all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the united nations
2470741 war is essentially an evil thing its consequences are not confined to the belligerent states alone but affect the whole world to initiate a war of aggression therefore is not only an international crime it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole
2470742 clearly there is an increase in the number of women who use violence in their everyday lives and when they are out drinking on the streets around the country
2470743 its a new phenomenon and it does stretch the resources of the police service

2470749 this claim is based on extremely well tested theories of physics and on observations of the cosmos
2470750 but it is notable how often we have been asked about the problem and we especially want to refute those like dr r ssler who try to use science to back up their claims
2470751 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2470752 we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2470753 i must protect the life and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are
2470754 we will not allow their deaths to go unpunished those responsible will receive a deserved punishment
2470755 the number of refugees is growing a humanitarian crisis is looming

2470758 its a good starting position for team target to be first and third i have to thank the team a lot they have certainly prepared great cars especially in qualifying we just have to worry about our line for the qualifying laps and it worked out
2470759 our race car is very similar to our qualifying set up hopefully we can lead a lot of laps gain a lot of points and close in on that championship

2470763 if you are feeling a shortage of time or money your best effort would be to focus upon better feeling thoughts and do more things that make you feel good your time is a perceptual thing and even though the clock is ticking the same for everyone your alignment affects your perception as well as the results that you allow as you observe the enormous differences in the effort that people apply and the results they achieve you have to conclude that there is more to the equation of achieving than action alone

2470783 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2470784 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2470785 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2470786 i took a view that china was going to be a world power
2470787 my kids started learning mandarin when they were four years old
2470788 when i went to taiwan 20 years ago and opened offices there i was impressed with the entrepreneurial spirit of the chinese people when they werent shackled
2470789 then in 2001 i travelled again over their major mainland industrial areas and noted that the taiwanese free spirit of business was spreading all through china
2470790 i dont see a revolution coming in china any more than in the united states
2470791 chinese people want change but not the radical change that western commentators imagine
2470792 the economic elite has either come out of the party elite or its been absorbed into it
2470793 otherwise not only will our generation lose face but also our ancestors
2470794 in the 1960s people werent necessarily convinced they were just terrorised into submission
2470795 now they stress management rather than control because they understand that persuasion is more effective than force
2470796 it does help explain the resilience of communist party rule despite the fissures in society and the corruption of much of officialdom
2470797 in the chinese cultural context a regimes legitimacy is conferred largely by its ability to mobilise this bureaucratic tradition
2470798 that is one of those real tipping points because that is something which they themselves whatever the rest of us think see as a fundamental core national interest
2470799 which doesnt mean necessarily that they will go to using that approach to their overall global engagements theyre going to need the rest of us for such a long time theres still so much that they cant do
2470800 theres no doubt that china saw the games as a sign of their international acceptance and its a good thing that they want it
2470801 in short to use an english expression they should take it easy
2470802 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2470803 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2470804 oh dtos not worth it we are gangster iowa all day
2470805 man spends too much time staring into sun gets a bit of heatstroke and develops religious delusions
2470806 we uh had sex ten minutes before the blood did that cause it
2470807 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2470970 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders as articulated in numerous un security council resolutions
2470971 calls on all parties to cease hostilities and to resume without delay so as to secure a political solution to the crisis which respects georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2470972 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force

2471036 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2471037 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2471038 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2471039 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2471040 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2471041 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2471042 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2471043 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

2471045 and do not be conformed to this world this age fashioned after and adapted to its external superficial customs but be transformed changed by the entire renewal of your mind by its new ideals and its new attitude that you may prove for yourselves what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of god even the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect in his sight for you
2471046 undergoing a complete change which under the power of god will find expression in character and conduct morphe lays stress on the inward change schema the word translated as conformed here lays stress on the outward the present continuous tenses indicated a process
2471047 half of spiritual growth is learning what we do not know the other half is unlearning what we do know and it is the failure to unlearn irrational fears and misconceptions that keeps us from becoming who god wants us to be faith is unlearning the senseless worries and misguided beliefs that keep us captive we are literally upgrading our minds by downloading the mind of christ like a computer the way to upgrade your mind is to download scripture then we stop thinking human thoughts and start thinking god thoughts

2471050 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2471051 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2471052 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2471053 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2471054 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2471055 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2471056 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2471057 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2471058 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2471059 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2471060 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2471061 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2471062 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2471063 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2471064 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2471065 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2471066 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2471067 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2471068 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2471069 culture of impunity that persists due to the government inaction in the case of media attacks
2471070 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2471071 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2471072 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

2471075 we wanted to reposition our forces but we cannot because militias are firing on rebels philippine authorities should stop these attacks
2471076 there are no indications at the moment that the rebels are pulling out in aleosan area occupied by bangsamoro islamic armed forces
2471077 the president only wanted the peace talks to succeed and for the country to move on for a more progressive philippines peace is what we really want to achieve here
2471078 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2471079 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2471080 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2471081 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2471082 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2471083 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2471084 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2471085 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2471086 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2471087 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2471088 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2471089 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

2471099 perhaps it can be said that seismic changes are taking place in malaysia because there has been no political renewal and special interest groups are entrenched perhaps the race based system which both lee and anwar challenged under which this group preserves its interests is no longer tenable in the age of the internet perhaps too many malays who support anwar now realise that malaysian malaysia or reformasi is what the country needs to lift the masses out of poverty not an astronaut or istanas if so then perhaps lee was right after all
2471100 that the seeds of malaysian malaysia planted four decades ago and dormant so long have suddenly taken root and germinated as reformasi
2471101 as the datuk seri anwar ibrahim saga unfolds before our eyes reflecting a similar episode 10 years ago it is strange that singaporeans do not experience a sense of deja vu not of the first episode but of aug 9 1965 while the absence of deja vu may be attributed to the passage of time of more than 40 years anyone who reads minister mentor lee kuan yews memoir a bestseller in singapore cannot fail to notice the parallels between lees battle against umno and anwars challenge against the same juggernaut
2471102 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

2471104 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

2471106 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2471107 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

2471109 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2471110 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2471111 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2471112 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2471113 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2471114 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2471115 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

2471128 after a bout of sex the body releases endorphins known as happy chemicals
2471129 from a physical point of view its similar to enjoying a good workout or going swimming but if youre having sex with someone you love it also makes you feel cared for and promotes self esteem
2471130 theres no doubt that sex is relaxing and so helps tackle insomnia
2471131 lots of people use sex whether with a partner or on their own as a way of getting to sleep the surge in oxytocin is a natural sedative

2471134 we know that having a strong relationship is a good indicator of longevity and a healthy sex life is a big part of that

2471222 los juegos ol mpicos es lo mejor que me ha pasado como deportista y como persona no tengo mucha presi n y no tengo que demostrar nada a nadie pas a la historia y ahora son otros los que tienen la presi n
2471223 roger federer rafael nadal o novak djokovic son los favoritos ellos tienen un poco m s de presi n que yo y tambi n los que tienen m s posibilidades de ganar

2471225 demostrar mi motivaci n y que no soy un 120 del mundo como indica el
2471226 foi a previs vel vit ria da verdade desportiva que o que mais gostamos por m e face ao comportamento do benfica neste processo acho que o fc porto deveria insistir junto das autoridades desportivas para que investiguem v rias coisas muito suspeitas que o envolveram nos ltimos anos
2471227 n o sei se o fc porto n o tem explorado essas situa es do benfica por quest es t cticas ou por julgar n o valer a pena por achar que o clube n o lhe faz concorr ncia mas julgo que est na hora de levantar essas quest es sobre quem pretensamente quer moralizar o futebol portugu s
2471228 s escutas com lu s filipe vieira sobre a ta a de portugal tal como o conselho de disciplina da liga diz tal n o lhe diz respeito pelo facto da prova ser organizada pela federa o ao que se passou no
2471229 o benfica fica muito mal nesta hist ria da uefa habituou se muitos anos a ser o clube do regime sempre protegido agora tem dirigentes que n o conseguem vencer nas quatro linhas e tentam atrav s destas formas menos claras resultados na secretaria que n o conseguiram em campo
2471230 devido a uma informa o incorrecta da federa o que induziu a uefa em erro
2471231 esta tamb m uma derrota para a federa o na medida em que deu uma informa o errada que colocou em cheque um clube seu filiado quando tem a obriga o de o proteger at que ponto um fort ssimo descuido podia ter consequ ncias graves para o fc porto h que apurar responsabilidades agora est tudo dependente do recurso de pinto da costa para o conselho de justi a da fpf

2471249 ser um mau exemplo para a democracia africana e um encorajamento a criminosos
2471250 ir dar a oportunidade ao ditador e criminoso mugabe de partilhar o poder com quem ganhou
2471251 uma solu o aceit vel seria a ren ncia de robert mugabe e a entrega do poder ao mdc de morgan tsangirai
2471252 isso de partilha de poder matar a democracia desencorajar os que pretendem uma implanta o efectiva da democracia em frica encorajar ditadores e criminosos como mugabe

2471323 im very happy and i think i did a very good job
2471324 today i have tried my best to compete whether or not this medal was the first gold
2471325 we have to focus on our own performance and this helps me to relax and not come under pressure

2471332 our peacekeepers and units subordinate to them are now carrying out an operation to force the georgian side to peace
2471333 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2471334 president mbeki will be coming for consultations with the principals of negotiations
2471335 he is going to meet the three principals basically to update them on the progress made so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2471336 the dialogue demonstrates that we share a common heritage and it is in our best interests to preserve that heritage and build on it
2471337 it is with this in mind that the ongoing dialogue between zanu pf and the two opposition mdc parties must be appreciated by every single zimbabwean
2471338 its not just about subsidising health services or making them free its about making them culturally appropriate with good access to language interpreters
2471339 people who come from overseas dont know what theyre entitled to or how to access those services
2471340 when people first arrive in the country they may not know they are entitled to see a subsidised gp through bulk billing
2471341 the united states olympic committee has learned of an incident that occurred earlier today involving two family members of a coach for the united states olympic mens indoor volleyball team
2471342 two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured

2471344 the united states calls for an immediate ceasefire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2471345 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2471346 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders as articulated in numerous un security council resolutions
2471347 calls on all parties to cease hostilities and to resume without delay so as to secure a political solution to the crisis which respects georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2471348 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2471349 thus the united states and its nato allies must together impose a price on russia if it does not promptly change course

2471355 lets see housing meltdown credit crunch oil shock not seen since the 1970s the economy is slowing unemployment growing and inflation increasing its the sixth year of a highly unpopular war and the presidents approval rating is at 30 percent the italian communist party could win this election the american democratic party is trying its best to lose it

2471357 its the manager and his management team who are responsible for paying out the players salary
2471358 it is their judgement about how to use the money they paid to ljungberg in a wiser way we all have our personal opinions about freddie and his efforts for this club
2471359 the signing of fredrik ljungberg was negotiated by former chairman eggert magnusson and the financial discussions relating to the transfer had nothing to do with the manager who has never been involved in player transfer and contract negotiations
2471360 all financial matters are controlled by the board with the manager playing a full role in the identification and recommendation of players
2471361 as stated previously the termination of ljungbergs contract was agreed mutually and was in the best interests of west ham united and the player
2471362 this was a footballing decision based on the fact the midfielders first team chances would have been limited

2471387 we are ready to to meet union home minister shivraj patil individually as we have put forth our view point before the centre
2471388 we will not talk to them as they are responsible for all this issue
2471389 we will boycott the delegation as mehbooba farooq and saifuddin soz are part of the team they are responsible for the amarnath land issue
2471390 energy has certainly come off pretty hard with the dollar move and that enables the companies that didnt get beat up to find a buyer
2471391 in this mirror you will see the image of the most beautiful woman in the world
2471392 theres not really any difference because i did the same thing last year and the previous years you line up you watch the tape you pick up on tendencies
2471393 its the same process the difference is youre looking down at the call sheet and youre calling the plays
2471394 some people say what happens when coach asks you to do something that you dont want to do
2471395 you have to understand that hes the general i say yes sir and i march up the hill
2471396 he looked good not just him but all of the receivers all of the receivers looked real good hes a great athlete just like the rest of the receivers we have
2471397 but i cant spill all of the beans right now youll have to wait until september 6

2471400 we live together so yeah we see each other a lot while the show is taping sometimes i see her when its not we dont have a lot of the same friends but we try to reserve one night a week to hang out in the fourth season youll see our fight gets cleared up basically i just start doing my own thing separately from her and lo lauren bosworth and i get busy but you know things change and friendships do drift apart sometimes lauren and i arent not friends were just not as close as we used to be
2471401 i do think living in that separate guest house of mine was definitely the cause of the tension between lauren and me we were used to being right next to each other in our apartment i dont really blame lo she and lauren have been friends for a long time
2471402 women and children leave the south ossetian capital tskhinvali under the heavy fire of the georgian army
2471403 the aim of escalating tensions is to destroy the peacekeeping architecture in the region with the hope of replacing it with new mechanisms that fit georgias purposes
2471404 russia needs to be a part of resolving the problem and solving the problem and not contributing to it
2471405 will the united states try enforcement or encourage georgia to try military options
2471406 without these two policy options enforcement and military operations the process will reach an impasse that is not in georgias interests
2471407 what russia is doing in georgia is open unhidden aggression and a challenge to the whole world
2471408 if the whole world does not stop russia today then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
2471409 russia has no more military capability than the uk or france nowadays
2471410 i would give it the due consideration that territorians would expect of me
2471411 i certainly wouldnt rush into supporting one party or another
2471412 i think it would very unwise to say what i would do without a lot more thought
2471413 i would say if i have the balance of power what i do will be given a lot of serious consideration

2471478 guru dutt was like a king a great dreamer but he required someone to translate his dreams into reality abrar was the man on the ground the engineer he held dutt down
2471479 but the two were completely in sync and there was a comfort level between them despite the hundreds of heated arguments they had at work
2471480 i was going through a rough patch personally the book provided an avenue to escape into another world
2471481 but he was completely rooted in reality guru dutt on the other hand was multifaceted whimsical and extremely superstitious he used to trudge up the slope for two and a half hours to pray at the haji malang shrine nearly 15 km from kalyan on the outskirts of mumbai every month
2471482 he dragged abrar on these pilgrimages with him but abrar preferred not to climb the hill as he was not into religion
2471483 he had a passion for words and their etymology when he went to paris he was obsessed with why some french words sounded so indian he had diverse interests which probably fuelled everything creative in him
2471484 i guess it was something that happened he was tested time and again and was found right and abrar got so caught up in the whirlpool of creativity and excitement to be working for a great director like guru dutt and being feted on the sets that the idea of taking credit did not occur

2471487 abrar believes that his relationship with waheeda rehman however emotional it might have been never went beyond a point but he was upset with the way guru dutt dropped waheeda
2471488 abrar felt it was unjust he said guru dutt was pandering to his male ego
2471489 i used to go to his 10th floor apartment in andheri every saturday and spend at least five six hours with him prodding him to speak
2471490 there were days he would be very moody and say meri tabiyat theek nahin hain i am not well and then i had to coax him to talk
2471491 there was only one book that i read before beginning my interactions with alvi it was a marathi book by arun gokhale a director who made a case why guru dutt was the real director of sahib bibi aur ghulam and not abrar i often used points from the book to trigger abrar into conversations
2471492 as part of my research i saw all the guru dutt movies because i had to relate to the sequences abrar was talking about
2471493 i saw kagaaz ke phool when i was in college i was very impressed but i felt that though the movie was beautiful it was depressing somewhere he should have done something to take up lift it it was like a whirlpool that took one down and down but i could strongly identify with the character in pyasa

2471510 royal indian culture is the inspiration for my colourful collection because indian culture and tradition is simply fascinating
2471511 indian tradition offers so much variety and it is up to the designer to create unusual and different designs from that
2471512 i wanted to do it for a long time but it never happened due to my other work commitments its better late than never

2471521 personally their practice was more important for me than attending the ceremony im happy they still wanted to go murugan was bit confused and he finally allowed them to attend the ceremony in casuals
2471522 we had kept saree for all women athletes and it just happened that they didnt have time to change
2471523 the chef de mission thought asking sania and sunitha not to go could lead to a controversy so he allowed
2471524 we wanted to make it colourful and hence they wore sarees of different colours

2471566 then i went from being a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president becoming a national public figure all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences and nothing could be further from the truth
2471567 i was at the beverly hilton i was trying to keep this mistake i made from becoming public
2471568 ive never paid a dime of money never asked anybody to pay a dime of money nothing has been done at my request
2471569 im not sure i had a political career in the future not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2471570 during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant
2471571 they were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2471572 out of respect for the families involved we cant say more than that
2471573 we are dealing with absolutely criminal and crazy acts of irresponsible and reckless decision makers which is on the ground producing dramatic and tragic consequences
2471574 battalion task forces have fully liberated tskhinvali of georgian armed forces and started pushing georgian units out of the area of responsibility of the peacekeeping forces
2471575 our peacekeepers along with reinforcement units are currently conducting an operation to force the georgian side to accept peace
2471576 the people responsible for this humanitarian disaster need to be held liable for what they have done
2471577 the aggression launched by the georgian side against the south ossetian civilians and russian peacekeepers
2471578 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2471579 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2471580 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2471581 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2471582 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2471583 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2471584 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2471585 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2471586 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2471587 people get very excited about their causes and lack the sense to see if the information backs them up
2471588 you dont see their bodies going blotchily red and hear them howling like a banshee
2471589 if i lift my kilt on bourbon street im much more likely to get arrested than if elizabeth takes off her top
2471590 president mbeki will be coming for consultations with the principals of negotiations
2471591 he is going to meet the three principals basically to update them on the progress made so far and to consult on how to take the dialogue forward
2471592 the dialogue demonstrates that we share a common heritage and it is in our best interests to preserve that heritage and build on it
2471593 it is with this in mind that the ongoing dialogue between zanu pf and the two opposition mdc parties must be appreciated by every single zimbabwean
2471594 wrap text in a box word by word as it scrolls in
2471595 there are either not many services available or the services are too general and not specific to a specialized vertical industry or a niche function
2471596 the higher developers can drive the percentage of reuse the more scale and productivity they gain they become the go to organization for cost efficient applications in a specific industry or for specialized business processes
2471597 toen ik in australi was hadden ze een placentaboom bij de rivier en alle placentas van die stam van die clan wat het ook voor aboriginalstam was kwamen onder die boom terecht de boom groeide hoger en hoger en torende boven de rest van moeder natuur uit het was schitterend
2471598 the death toll is likely to increase because heavy rain is still falling and the rivers in the area are rising
2471599 the water and walls of mud came at night when everybody was sleeping
2471600 aware of the reports of the accidents suffered by two american citizens we are working with the chinese authorities to find out more on the cause of the incident
2471601 the historical anomaly of dioceses that have nothing to do with the black community going all the way to africa to make these relationships
2471602 this is just another revisionist attempt to use anything to undermine the orthodox position of the church and spread the agenda of inclusiveness
2471603 as a person who knows what it means to be oppressed i refuse to allow my brothers and sisters in the faith to be discriminated against
2471604 very inappropriate to equate the struggle of blacks in africa or in the diaspora
2471605 war is never a good thing no one wants it
2471606 they understood the hiroshima bombing because of the japanese military
2471607 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2471608 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
2471609 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2471610 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2471611 the palestinian authority is interested in releasing the biggest number of prisoners regardless of their political affiliations
2471612 the issue of prisoners held in israeli jails is a political issue which is no less important than other permanent status issues it can only be resolved by setting up a timetable for the release of all the prisoners
2471613 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2471614 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2471615 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2471616 the face that i see in the mirror more and more is a stranger to me more and more i can see theres a danger of becoming what i never thought id be
2471617 we were on our way to prague to see the iron maiden concert like so many other people on this train
2471618 the wagon in front of our wagon was completely destroyed i heard crying and screaming there was a boy who was all buried under the debris we tried to pull him out but it was impossible and then the young woman she was all naked and her body so deformed i cannot describe that
2471619 we are shocked and horrified at this news and wish to pass on our heartfelt condolences to the families of those who died and our best hopes and prayers for the rapid recovery of the many injured apparently there were many polish and czech maiden fans on board on the way to friday nights concert at the slavia football stadium in prague which is why we were contacted and informed of this by the polish media we hope that you fans will join us in praying for all those involved

2471660 we have a good player in alonso and we have another good player coming in soon we can improve the squad so we will try to do that we will bring in one more player if we can
2471661 i do not know when but clearly we have problems on the left harry kewell has gone fabio aurelio is injured and sebastien leto cannot get a work permit
2471662 ryan babel is also away in the olympic games maybe he can come back and fill that role but i know we can improve in this area
2471663 who comes in it could be another left sided player rather than a central midfielder maybe he can play in three different positions
2471664 that is a positive thing i am talking about one player but i wont say the name
2471665 i will try to improve the team and the squad if i can i am pleased because we have not lost again i will try to do my best to improve the squad

2471667 no es dif cil imaginar la emoci n en que viv an descubriendo los accidentes de la costa as los nombres no los daba el comandante de la flota ni lo suger an los pilotos saltaban del calendario
2471668 es algo con lo que nac y ya me cost una cirug a pero ahora me ayuda porque mi coraz n es una bomba fuerte con poco margen para el desgaste pues empuja m s sangre en menos tiempo
2471669 estoy fuerte en la copa mundial en el clima favorable de rusia compet a un 80 por ciento lo cual significa que tengo un abanico de posibilidades para mejorar
2471670 nunca me descalifican pero los especialistas dicen que mis mejores juegos ol mpicos deben ser los de londres o quiz s los del 2016 a los que llegar maduro yo no quiero esperar porque me siento en condiciones de entrar entre los cinco mejores este mes en pek n y tengo como meta una medalla
2471671 ser una prueba lenta y ganar el m s inteligente yo quiero estar sereno y caminar desde atr s hacia adelante para terminar fuerte habr que cuidarse de los chinos adem s de los rusos y otros europeos y asi ticos
2471672 lo conocen poco y eso ayuda en la delegaci n nadie le exigir nada y entre sus contrarios aun no lo toman muy en serio as que hacer su trabajo tranquilo
2471673 no tengo ventajas no la hay cuando compites contra los mejores mi coraz n es muy fuerte pero s lo saldr adelante si lo ofrezco sin perder la alegr a a fin de cuentas los juegos ol mpicos son mi mejor sue o
2471674 hice historia y son otros los que tienen ahora la presi n
2471675 los juegos ol mpicos es lo mejor que me ha pasado como deportista y como persona pero ahora estoy centrado en estos juegos y estoy tranquilo no tengo mucha presi n no tengo que demostrar nada ni a nadie lo que hice ah est pas a la historia y ahora son otros los que tienen la presi n pueden ser sus ltimos juegos y necesitan ganar
2471676 roger federer rafael nadal o novak djokovic son los favoritos ellos tienen un poco m s de presi n que yo y tambi n los que tienen m s posibilidades de ganar
2471677 estoy contento aqu porque son mis terceros juegos ol mpicos y tengo que defender mi t tulo individual y de dobles no ser f cil pero estamos aqu en la lucha y lo intentaremos hacer lo mejor posible
2471678 demostrar mi motivaci n y que no soy un 120 del mundo como indica el r nking ahora y que ese puesto se debe a un baj n en el juego quiero demostrar que estoy tratando de volver creo que estoy en el camino correcto
2471679 rafa nadal es un gran tipo y un gran jugador y creo que se merece ser n mero uno m s que todo es un gran luchador y merec a estar y tocar el n mero uno no s qui n lo va a ser al final del a o pero es una persona que admiro mucho por lo que ha hecho igual que a federer y djokovic creo que los tres est n por encima del resto
2471680 fue una carrera muy dura hice un buen papel estuve ah en el grupo pero nos ganaron los calambres nos gan la deshidrataci n el calor pero estoy contento porque di mi ciento por ciento
2471681 est el ganador del giro el ganador del tour los ganadores de las cl sicas los m s fuertes no falta nadie y eso hace que sea una carrera muy dura y eso es lo bonito e importante para uno porque logramos atacar terminar y dar el cien por ciento
2471682 me ganaron los calambres y no tuve fuerzas y eso fue lo que me dobl a lo mejor si me hubiera sentido un poco mejor habr a llegado m s adelante
2471683 pero con suerte espero estar sana y lista para jugar mi mejor tenis
2471684 he mantenido una l nea regular durante la temporada pero ahora no estoy en mi mejor momento en wimbledon tuve una lesi n de menisco y no pude entrenar durante un par de semanas es dif cil todo esto para recuperar la forma intento mejorar poco a poco estos d as para sentirme f sicamente m s fuerte y c moda despu s en la cancha pero se necesita tiempo
2471685 los juegos se disputan cada cuatro a os y es un evento especial juegas por tu pa s y tienes sensaciones distintas a las que vives en otros torneos es fabuloso porque est s entre los mejores deportistas del mundo y es una gran experiencia
2471686 el momento de forma en el que estar al inicio de la competici n intentar entrenar m s hoy jugar algunas bolas y ver c mo me siento estoy mejor que ayer y veremos ma ana como va todo no creo que sea posible ver mi mejor tenis a pesar de los esfuerzos por mejorar mi estado f sico
2471687 la n mero uno del mundo es la confirmaci n de un sue o me he sentido fuerte y c moda en la cancha pero para estar bien se necesita tiempo estoy muy feliz de haber llegado al n mero uno del mundo y llegar a formar parte de otras grandes campeonas de la historia
2471688 ahora en el n mero uno estoy muy feliz de haberlo conseguido fue un sue o de la infancia y para m es un logro incre ble despu s de pasar un a o tan dif cil con las lesiones y la enfermedad estoy muy orgullosa de ello y s lo espero que pueda seguir trabajando duro tengo una motivaci n extra para esforzarme y mantener ese r nking
2471689 no siento ninguna presi n es todo lo contrario una motivaci n pero hay que ser prudente porque cualquier d a a m me pasar lo que a ella y dejar de ser n mero uno lo importante es que somos dos de las mejores del mundo y que nuestro pa s puede estar orgulloso porque en el torneo masculino est novak djokovic una gran situaci n para un pa s tan peque o no hay raz n para la rivalidad s lo un aliciente para seguir estando entre las mejores
2471690 mi rodilla est mejor que en wimbledon pero todav a lejos del cien por cien espero que cuando empiece la competici n mejore desafortunadamente el mi rcoles me resent un poco cuando entren y eso me hizo desechar la posibilidad de jugar el torneo individual y plantearme disputar el dobles
2471691 el calendario de la competici n te obliga a jugar todos los d as si participas en dobles e individual mi rodilla no resistir a eso por lo tanto he decidido jugar el dobles con huber que es la n mero uno del mundo cada dos d as
2471692 creo que tenemos una buena ocasi n de lograr una medalla hay cierta decepci n por no competir en individual pero echar el resto por el dobles
2471693 hemos practicado mucho ahora en las ltimas semanas he visto que nos complementamos bien
2471694 he centrado todos mis esfuerzos en los juegos ol mpicos y ahora en el dobles intentar ganar una medalla para mi pa s y despu s pensar en el abierto de estados unidos despu s ver como me encuentro me tomar un tiempo para pensar y decidir c mo orientar el futuro

2471711 no podemos pensar en medallas por haber ganado un partido
2471712 hemos ganado un partido ante un rival voluntarioso pero inferior no podemos pasar directamente a pensar en las medallas por delante tenemos un largo y dif cil camino ante rivales a los que tendremos que enfrentarnos con todas nuestras fuerzas y recursos
2471713 tenemos que ir partido a partido y pensando en nuestro pr ximo rival acabamos de empezar y todav a no hemos estado en situaciones dif ciles en el marcador y no sabemos si sabremos solucionarlas
2471714 el equipo mantuvo el ritmo de partido y no baj los brazos ante un rival que fue inferior pero que puso ganas y que jug un buen voleibol en jugadas aisladas
2471715 hemos bloqueado bien y eso nos ha dado una superioridad total de la red lo dem s ha sido muy f cil y eso sirve para enviar un mensaje de c mo podemos jugar

2471762 i have a degree in social work and mental health and have worked in the mental health field for very many years i work currently with a general population of adults with psychiatric disabilities
2471763 i have done a lot of research have been to the centers annual conference on dissociation and trauma a couple of times one of the biggest in the us i have a bookcase full of books on child abuse treatment diagnosis etc
2471764 that the current diagnostic criteria for did be applied to multiples oneupmanship
2471765 multiplicity is not always though usually is the result of child abuse
2471766 i am looking for some feedback here regarding the forum there are so many peeps who do not register and the board seems to have infrequent posters
2471767 who the f k cares done with forums and thinking people actually give a damn

2471777 nuestra meta es estar entre los diez mejores pa ses del mundo hoy estamos en el d cimo cuarto lugar en los ltimos juegos y campeonatos del mundo hemos estado entre el duod cimo y el d cimo quinto
2471778 lo que hay que hacer es tener una preparaci n como la que nosotros pensamos que hemos hecho
2471779 hemos estado compitiendo en concursos de primer nivel para estar al mismo nivel y con los mismos competidores que vamos a competir ac y eso es justamente lo que nos hace falta un roce internacional
2471780 un poco injusto debido a que dejan de competir muchos pa ses muy poderosos porque se eliminan entre ellos en el centro de europa
2471781 yo creo que hay tres grupos b sicamente las potencias que ocupan los primeros cuatro lugares estados unidos alemania holanda y suiza
2471782 segundo bloque de pa ses importantes en el que deber amos tratar de estar
2471783 nuestra pelea es contra canad brasil obviamente china nueva zelanda australia el mismo hong kong que tiene equipo esos pa ses son a los que de entrada nosotros tenemos que pensar en que tenemos que ganar
2471784 en algunas ocasiones es una potencia ecuestre hoy viene un poquito m s baja que muchas otras veces
2471785 en 1948 era un equipo militar esos jinetes eran como un equipo de profesionales estaban dedicados al cien por cien a la cuesti n ecuestre
2471786 en esas dos olimpiadas concurrieron circunstancias especiales la del 48 fue despu s de la guerra y en europa adem s de las bajas no se practicaba el deporte en mosc hubo un boicot a las olimpiadas y muchas potencias no acudieron
2471787 se enfr an r pido aqu sudan mucho pierden mucho l quido pero los caballos se sienten bien y las instalaciones est n incre bles
2471788 la competencia dura 90 segundos si lo manejas bien no tiene por qu haber problema
2471789 creo que dentro de lo que nos puede afectar el calor y la humedad de hong kong somos a los que menos puede afectarnos porque nuestros caballos s viven y concursan en este tipo de clima m s seguido que muchos otros

2471796 this is the real thing we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
2471797 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
2471798 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based

2471801 het was mijn doel om een medaille te halen dat is gelukt
2471802 een fransman leek voor 500 euro een kaartje te willen verkopen maar hij kwam niet meer terug het is om bijna wanhopig van te worden want we hebben alles al geprobeerd
2471803 mijn zoon robert zei dat oma maar moet gaan als we geen kaarten meer vinden maar die barstte toen in tranen uit omdat ze het hem ook gunt het is heel vervelend allemaal
2471804 ik vond het een zeer nette wedstrijd van onze kant
2471805 we begonnen een beetje zenuwachtig maar kwamen steeds beter in ons spel op de beslissende momenten lieten we echter de scoringskansen liggen de blokkering van elaine youngs was doorslaggevend ze won niet voor niets brons bij athene 2004
2471806 als je zo dichtbij bent moet je het ook afmaken
2471807 toch mogen we best tevreden zijn deze partij geeft vertrouwen voor de komende twee groepswedstrijden tegen minder hoog geplaatste tegenstanders
2471808 i would like to thank providence and the almighty for choosing me of all people to be allowed to wage this battle for germany
2471809 freedom and fear justice and cruelty have always been at war and we know that god is not neutral between them
2471810 the npp polling agent at the centre told me that he saw a vehicle with ndc colours on it conveying the minors to the centre to be registered
2471811 they were accompanied by thugs to the centre apparently to dare anyone who would come their way
2471812 this generated into a fight it was i who rushed to the scene to calm tempers i called the police but they refused to come putting the lives of the electoral officers in danger surprisingly the ndc polling agents at the centre were able to identify them as being indigenes of twifo ayaase and beponbeng a twin town in the area
2471813 when i called the district commander of the ghana police service a s p stephen dillaporte to send some men to restore peace he refused
2471814 saat berada di drum tower di bejing pusat dua anggota keluarga tersebut ditusuk oleh pelaku yang menurut penegak hukum setempat merupakan penyerang tunggal satu anggota keluarga terbunuh dan satu lagi lainnya terluka serius

2471816 presiden telah diinformasikan dan dia turut berbela sungkawa untuk keluarga korban
2471817 we had no other option at that material moment than to grant bail to the suspects who had sustained various degrees of injury
2471818 that n r if he gets elected ill assassinate him myself
2471819 at the rounds we realised that the number of people who kept trooping in to register kept increasing so we will also keep a close eye on it until the whole exercise is over
2471820 my duty is not to interfere with the electoral process but to make sure that law and order is maintained during the exercise
2471821 i will draw the attention of the ec if anything goes contrary to the exercise

2471826 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2471827 we are a freedom loving nation that is right now under attack
2471828 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2471829 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2471830 the european union in liaison with all the protagonists is working towards a ceasefire so as to avoid an extension of the conflict

2471833 blood spilled in south ossetia will be blamed on these people and their associates
2471834 heavy weapons and artillery have been sent there and tanks have been added
2471835 deaths and injuries have been reported including among russian peacekeepers its all very sad and alarming and of course there will be a response

2471837 ik had nog net voor de race even contact met tim het tactisch plannetje was duidelijk met de keniaan mwange en de iranees shadi waren de twee skiffeurs die de eerste vier niet konden halen nog voor de start gekend de opdracht van tim was dan ook zonneklaar zo hoog mogelijk eindigen om dan met een knap resultaat in een relatief makkelijke kwartfinalerace terecht te komen concurrentie de argentijn fernandez vierde op de spelen 2004 en de zwitser vonarburg die tim in de laatste world cupfinale van dit seizoen met twee honderdsten van n seconde versloeg waren op papier de meest te duchten tegenstanders de griek christou regerend europees kampioen in dubbeltwee de outsider
2471838 tim nam zoals afgesproken een vinnige start en controleerde de ganse race hij won dus de openingsrace en dat biedt veelbelovende perspectieven voor de kwartfinaleraces die maandag worden geroeid
2471839 natuurlijk hadden ze zich n race kunnen besparen maar met de beste tijd van de vijf boten die maandag de herkansingsrace zullen kleuren maken de gentenaren toch een grote kans om zich binnen de top drie te roeien het komt erop aan zich nu niet te laten verrassen in de start en zich zo economisch mogelijk binnen die top drie te roeien het liefst zelfs zo hoog mogelijk eindigen want een goed resultaat kan hen misschien ook in een meer haalbare halve finale race loodsen het tactisch plan dat ze zullen mee krijgen van de olympische coach verdonckschoot wordt erg belangrijk met het oog op het vervolg van dit toernooi
2471840 het lab van de gerechtelijke politie onderzoekt de beelden nu en bekijkt of de kwaliteit voldoende is we behandelen dit zoals elke klacht of tip
2471841 we hebben veel kansen gecre erd waren telkens sterker en die prestaties waren bij de beste van wat ik tot nu toe van het team heb gezien een klein iets wat we misschien nog moeten veranderen is dat we nog kalmer aan de bal moeten zijn en geduldiger we moeten niet bij elk klein gaatje een doelpunt willen maken
2471842 tegen spanje moeten we naar onszelf kijken en de concentratie op de bal houden
2471843 zij zijn een van de favorieten voor het goud dus een punt zou voor ons al spectaculair zijn
2471844 spanje is samen met nederland australi duitsland en zuid korea een van de vijf potenti le podiumkandidaten het zou heel mooi zijn als we tegen duitsland en spanje 1 of 2 punten halen maar voor ons moet het gebeuren in de wedstrijd tegen nieuw zeeland
2471845 we zullen echter zeker onze kans wagen tegen spanje in elk toernooi heb je wel een topland dat niet presteert of iemand onverwacht die aan de medailleboom rammelt we hebben bewezen dat we tegen iedereen kunnen presteren

2471851 the number of newly laid off people signing up for jobless benefits last week climbed to its highest point in more than six years as companies cut back given the faltering economy

2471853 at least eight in ten americans believe the nation is on the wrong track the republican president is historically unpopular from stunning democratic gains in party registration to the high levels of economic anxiety obama should have a healthy lead by almost every measure yet in poll after poll obama conspicuously fails to cross the 50 percent threshold
2471854 my campaign has uncovered evidence that my opponent jim martin did not want senator barack obama to be president of the united states and that jim martin voted against barack obama in the february 2008 presidential primary election in georgia
2471855 what will happen at the convention in respect to my putting my name into nomination a roll call vote and the usual kind of process that occurs at conventions i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2471856 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2471857 obama gaggled with reporters on his plane between minneapolis and chicago when asked about reports of angry hillary supporters obama said were not talking to those people and were talking to directly to the clinton campaign people and it has gone seamlessly
2471858 mr mccain has beat mr obamas channel for seven straight days and 11 of the past 14 days in a signal he intends to compete for the youtube vote
2471859 that not only in that mccain ad were there two underdressed blondes mixed with the black guy in the ad but there are also images of the leaning tower of pisa the washington monument and the victory column in berlin as bob herbert put it
2471860 comparing the democratic presidential hopeful to celebrities britney spears and paris hilton
2471861 to a certain extent the ads are having some effect but you cant be thrown off your game plan by a momentary dip in polls
2471862 after years of battling with president clinton house republicans are shifting their sights to vice president al gore and
2471863 former democratic presidential candidate mike gravel was caught on tape last week telling a crowd in washington d c that they should harass a federal prosecutor who helped bring criminal contempt charges against a palestinian activist find out where he lives find out where his kids go to school find out where his office is picket him all the time gravel said in an audio tape obtained by the investigative project on terrorism and provided to fox news
2471864 im not suggesting a five year war has helped things necessarily although the reconstruction has but most of the damage that was done to the iraqi infrastructure was done well before the u s came
2471865 it looks at first like any other shuttered storefront near the boardwalk some garish lettering and a cartoonish invitation to a delight or a scam in this case theres spongebob squarepants saying it dont gitmo better
2471866 in reflection of how critical it has become for the us military to retain native language and cultural know how in its ranks
2471867 never even said theres a link between al qaeda and iraq
2471868 obama cant point to a single instance in which sean hannity or talk radio
2471869 3 4 increase in single copy newsstand sales for the first half of 2008
2471870 the republican also has pulled ahead on the issue of balancing the federal budget
2471871 in contrast if anything pews respondents said they want to hear more not less about the republican candidate just 26 in the poll said they had heard too much about mccain while a larger number 38 reported that they had heard too little about the putative republican candidate
2471872 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified

2471876 our politics has gotten so ah nasty thats the word i was looking for
2471877 but not just nasty also cynical and manipulative right so im happy to have a battle of words because ive got facts on my side
2471878 ive got truth on my side i fear no man when ive got truth on my side
2471879 we have sensed a lack of enthusiasm from the obama camp
2471880 stephanopoulos a gentleman named william ayers he was part of the weather underground in the 1970s they bombed the pentagon the capitol and other buildings hes never apologized for that can you explain your relationship to him for the voters and explain to democrats why it wont be a problem
2471881 in may when a mccain adviser proposed a series of pre convention appearances at town hall meetings obama said i think thats a great idea obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
2471882 there is an image right there in that very beginning of the leaning tower of pisa and there is an image of the washington monument
2471883 have you seen the paris hilton campaign video responding john mccain
2471884 will not run ads that are damaging to oil companies
2471885 there may be no corporation in america that has attacked the rights of workers and undercut the living standards of americans more than wal mart
2471886 write to every member of congress declaring that any democrat receiving or keeping wal mart money can kiss any labor donations or labor support good bye
2471887 what we need today is an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and create new ones we need to reduce the tax burden on businesses that choose to make their home in the united states of america we need to open new markets to u s products and we need to reduce the cost of healthcare and we need to end the out of control spending in washington that is putting our debt on the backs of our children
2471888 indicates his party is seriously considering another shutdown threat to force a vote on offshore oil drilling in september
2471889 the precise maneuvering of a shutdown threat is complicated but it revolves around the fact that key government spending bills expire when the fiscal year ends september 30 and congress must vote next month to keep the government operating
2471890 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling because i think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy
2471891 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2471892 in the western world journalists can mostly say what they want as long as they agree with the positions of their publishers
2471893 will defend their corporate right to speak but not mine nor that of any other independent journalist
2471894 there are many advantages of being printed by the sun
2471895 its big modern presses allow us to print six sections instead of four to print many more pages to have more color to print more quickly to do more zoning and to have better inserting
2471896 if the roll call of the states is conducted she might might still win
2471897 it is unlikely a running mate will be selected before the candidate returns from a weeks holiday in hawaii which starts this friday that leaves about 10 days until the start of the democratic party convention in denver
2471898 in addition to michelle obama the candidates inner circle consists of just three people david axelrod his senior strategist david plouffe his campaign manager and robert gibbs a senior adviser all three are intensely loyal and discreet obama professionals
2471899 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
2471900 one third of his record breaking haul has come from donations of 1 000 or more a total of 112 million more than senator john mccain mr
2471901 behind those larger donations is a phalanx of more than 500 obama bundlers fund raisers who have each collected contributions totaling 50 000 or more many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in washington nearly three dozen of the bundlers have raised more than 500 000 each including more than a half dozen who have passed the 1 million mark and one or two who have exceeded 2 million according to interviews with fund raisers
2471902 i firmly disagree that a racial reading of chozicks story is ridiculous and i would counter that any failure on chozicks part to recognize such is just a wee bit clueless
2471903 if youve got michelle as first lady and malia and sasha running around on the south lawn that changes how america looks at itself
2471904 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
2471905 if barack obama draws bigger crowds lets have more obama coverage
2471906 the current outsized attention obamas getting notably the three tv networks anchoring their news coverage from his recent international tour seems a market savvy response to audience interest
2471907 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2471908 is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol

2471913 we are at war the economy is in the tank no one can afford gas in the tank but two minutes was given to this mouse research
2471914 my status has not changed although in a technical way it has i am on call to the editor of the post when they deem that they need reporting and editing from me
2471915 obviously were not the first newspaper to be affected by the continuing downturn in advertising
2471916 we are hopeful that by opting for our employees to voluntarily sign up for buyouts we can avoid any type of layoffs going forward
2471917 the position has been a very valuable part of the newspaper but i felt the need to move the resource to another area i didnt think we should weaken the editorial voice of the newspaper
2471918 given the cutbacks planned at the js i was told they could no longer justify having a full time editorial cartoonist although im taking the buyout im not going willingly im being forced out

2471921 felling i wish that we would see some accountability where if somebody gets it right you know they get a little bit more airtime in the fall but if somebody gets it wrong they are grounded
2471922 np i wanted to convey to women they can do anything if they know the power and keep the faith the power is within them the faith is within them too so its about themselves they should be themselves have confidence in that
2471923 back in the 1990s your incomes grew by 6 000 and over the last several years theyve actually fallen by nearly 1 000
2471924 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
2471925 a well designed mechanism can impose a fee on a small share of these windfall profits without affecting incentives for oil companies and without affecting the price of oil barack obama will require oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to provide direct relief worth 500 for an individual and 1 000 for a married couple
2471926 the truth is that mccains campaign has received 1 33 million from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry not 2 million
2471927 we find the 2 million figure is based on a mistaken calculation
2471928 cheney has not sought a speaking slot at the convention nor has his staff sought a role for him at the convention
2471929 the vice president has a great deal of respect for john mccain and as of last friday was out campaigning for him
2471930 claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
2471931 was designed to portray a false link between husseins regime and al qaeda as a justification for the iraq war

2471955 this is very useful information from fdf it will help the waste industry and local planners to understand where its worthwhile to provide facilities like anaerobic digestion which is the key technology for material such as food waste i chaired a meeting only this week with around fifty senior industry and ngo executives who have pledged to work with government on ways to increase the use of anaerobic digestion solid facts and figures like these will be a vital way of taking that aim forward
2471956 the results of this survey demonstrate the level of ongoing commitment by fdf members to making a significant contribution to improving the environment by targeting areas where they can make the biggest difference our members initiatives are preventing significant amounts of waste at their sites and it is fantastic that the vast majority of waste that does arise is already treated in an environmentally friendly way we hope that the survey results will send a message to the waste industry to invest more in anaerobic digestion and composting capacity in line with fdfs ambition to send zero food and packaging waste to landfill from 2015
2471957 wrap welcomes fdf establishing a base line on food waste for its members the industry is already taking steps to recycle and recover waste this work also shows the potential for further treatment of food waste using technology such as anaerobic digestion wrap will continue to work with fdf members on further waste minimisation activities and on expanding the food waste processing infrastructure through its capital grants scheme

2471992 there is grandeur in this view of life with its several powers having been originally breathed by the creator into a few forms or into one
2471993 simple animals and plants existed on earth far before complex ones
2471994 if all living creatures must have a living parent if living creatures are different and if simpler forms were around before complex forms then the more complex forms must have come from the simpler forms

2472013 a client can avoid insufficient and unavailable balance penalties by keeping up to date on the balance in their account and with overdraft coverage
2472014 so they have to make it up in fees said mike moebs chairman and chief executive of the company which sells overdraft plans to banks

2472043 if we remove all kinds of hurdles that comes across logistics we can drive costs down to our advantage
2472044 if the logistics prices come down we can minimise the exploitation of both the producers as well as the consumers to a great extent as it will reduce the margins of the middlemen
2472045 being a part of the system we cannot escape reality we need to work the logistics to manage the industry effectively
2472046 no industry could afford to run without efficient management of logistics
2472047 with better transport and infrastructure we can bring down the cost of logistics

2472075 i really like pierre dreossi the clubs general manager and i believe that is reciprocal

2472200 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2472201 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2472202 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2472203 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2472204 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2472205 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2472206 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2472207 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2472208 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2472209 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2472210 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2472211 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2472212 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2472213 this is not about a tiny separatist area inside georgia
2472214 this is not about georgia anymore it is about america its values
2472215 we wont allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
2472216 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory this is the worst nightmare one can encounter
2472217 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2472218 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2472219 ambulances cannot move hospitals are reported to be overflowing surgery is taking place in corridors people are hiding in their basements with no electricity nocommunications
2472220 i must protect the life and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are
2472221 one hundred and fifty russian tanks armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles entered south ossetia
2472222 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2472223 we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all over the country
2472224 we are in a situation of self defence against a big and mighty neighbour
2472225 we are a country of less than five million people it would be suicidal for us to provoke russia
2472226 cnn is reporting that upwards of 1 000 georgian civilians have been killed so far and russian warplanes have dropped bombs on at least one georgian military air base
2472227 if the republican party continues to ignore its traditional conservative base then the party is headed to oblivion
2472228 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
2472229 government is not reason it is not eloquence it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master firearms are second only to the constitution in importance they are the peoples libertys teeth
2472230 at this juncture in the infowar discussions of religion a dozen christian sects squabbling
2472231 now our peacekeepers are waging a fierce battle with regular forces from the georgian army in the southern region of tskhinvali
2472232 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state reloaded not comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2472233 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2472234 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian disaster is gathering pace
2472235 the georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years
2472236 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened the fire at their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2472237 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legal document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2472238 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a requirement because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2472239 we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years
2472240 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2472241 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2472242 i was in the hospital yesterday where i saw many civilian wounded the hospital was later destroyed by a georgian jet i dont know whether the wounded were still there
2472243 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2472244 they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now
2472245 today im going to sign a decree to introduce martial law in georgia and present it to parliament for approval
2472246 there is no bombing of tskhinvali street battles are continuing in the city involving our soldiers we do not plan to bomb our own servicemen in tskhinvali
2472247 most of south ossetias territory has been liberated and is now controlled by georgia i call on russia to stop bombarding peaceful georgian towns
2472248 is heading a meeting to discuss a series of urgent measures to stop the violence in south ossetia to protect the civilian population and russian citizens in the conflict zone
2472249 the goal of georgias actions in the conflict zone is to establish peace in the region and we will not stop until we have attained this goal
2472250 georgia has tried to build a fortified structure a block post near the nuli village our reaction to such actions will be very tough because we see them as bandits who open fire on our civilians
2472251 russia is putting in a great deal of effort to promote the idea of peace talks we treat such initiatives with understanding and believe they are necessary
2472252 we insist on the talks including russia and north ossetia we will not hold one to one discussions with georgia
2472253 is acting as a constructive and responsible mediator the aim of which is to diminish the tensions to restart the negotiating process aimed at settling of the conflict
2472254 we have an influx of volunteers coming into the republic so far we see no necessity for them but those who are arriving are being organised into army units these units will be under the command of our defence ministry
2472255 they voiced concern about the actions of the georgian side near tskhinvali which can be regarded as preparations for war
2472256 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery

2472280 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2472281 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2472282 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2472283 there were a couple of hundred people looking on they were completely quiet not hostile or negative
2472284 were calling for an end to the chinese governments occupation in tibet
2472285 hes very tall with long arms and i was on the defensive too much
2472286 i felt ok out there but it was a tough fight because hes the world champion
2472287 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2472288 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2472289 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2472290 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2472291 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2472395 en la primera manga comet un fallo de escuela de vela
2472396 una pena porque estaba tirando bastante bien y a gusto

2472399 und trotzdem mag ich mein leben hamburg fehlt mir aber ich finde es nach wie vor gut dass ich im moment nur dieses eine thema habe n mlich rudern
2472400 wir sind dankbar es ist besser geworden und ich bin froh dass es dieses team gibt
2472401 espa a est viviendo un a o fant stico en todos los deportes
2472402 el plan viene previamente dise ado y viene de la relaci n entre el m dico el endocrino y los entrenadores no lo preparamos como una inspiraci n del ltimo momento ya viene dise ado a partir de ah tanto el dise o de la rutina de los horarios y de los entrenamientos tiene su momento
2472403 ahora mismo lo nico importante es s lo nueva zelanda a las que nos enfrentamos dentro de dos d as a las nueve de la ma ana eso es lo nico que importa ahora mismo
2472404 jugamos con ellas un torneo de preparaci n en paterna valencia cuando est bamos preparando el preol mpico es un equipo agresivo aguerrido quiz no tiene grandes f sicos pero es un equipo que se conoce muy bien joven y que no conjetura en el campo no se ci e a patrones claros ni disciplinados con lo cual no sabes por donde te va a llevar el peligro
2472405 sabemos que va a ser un partido a n m s dif cil que el de mal nos espera espa a y espero que seamos capaces de jugar bien contra ellas tienen talento es un equipo que cuenta con muy buenas jugadoras
2472406 han mejorado como equipo tienen m s confianza y juegan m s c modo
2472407 la estrategia que ten amos pensada y preparada para la ce ida ha sido err nea aunque luego en las empopadas en las dos mangas hemos tenido algo m s de presi n y hemos conseguido recuperar las boyas de sotavento con poco viento y muchos barcos se convierten en cr ticas y mientras en la segunda manga he pasado bien en la primera he cometido un desastre de escuela de vela de iniciaci n
2472408 ese error me ha servido para espabilarme para ser algo m s agresivo en la segunda hacer mejor las cosas y estar ah delante
2472409 hay un banco de arena en medio del campo de regatas y si la boya esta por encima de los 110 grados te hace irte a la derecha que es el lado malo mientras que si se lo ponen un poco m s largo te conviene pasar el banco de arena y buscar las corrientes limpias que la clave
2472410 por eso continu en la segunda regata he llegado de un solo largo he pasado el banco de arena y remontado la boya de sotavento por la izquierda con lo que me he puesto segundo o tercero luego he adelantado a unos me han adelantado otros pero he aguantado
2472411 estar entre los cinco primeros es la clave pues se puede luchar incluso por el oro si estas entre los 10 primeros en la mayor a de las regatas se puede pelear por las medallas y eso es lo que hay que intentar de aqu al final de semana lo que pasa es que entre la meteorolog a y las corrientes va a estar muy complicado sin contar con los rivales que ya es duro
2472412 tenemos que mantener una reuni n con nuestro entrenador paul maes pues creo que hemos hecho una mala valoraci n de los riesgos especialmente en la segunda manga cuando hemos llegado a ir segundas en mi opini n una vez en ese puesto lo que hay que hacer es mantener la tranquilidad y no arriesgar m s de lo necesario pues si te pasa una o dos rivales no ocurre nada eres cuarta o quinta y eso est muy bien
2472413 en realidad no s que es lo que ha pasado pues no creo que lo estuvi ramos haciendo tal vez haya sido por una man a que tenemos del 470 de hacer alg n movimiento brusco y ellos han entendido que est bamos remando no lo s pero ha sido una pena
2472414 decidimos estar tranquilas en las salidas pues sab amos que en las ce idas pod amos recuperar ya que est bamos navegando bastante bien en esos rumbos

2472595 when were on the competition ground the best thing to do is just to live up to our own standards we cant pay attention to judging issues
2472596 we knew to compete with china we cannot make any mistakes and today we made a few
2472597 if we didnt make mistakes and lose then thats bad but we made some mistakes and we have to make sure we dont repeat them in final

2472664 these studies were conducted throughout 2007 in addition to onsite wind data collection copies of the application have been placed in public libraries in randolph and barbour counties and the application can also be downloaded from the psc web site
2472665 one does not need to go anywhere to hear the sound of what is coming to an end the sound takes away everything the sound of absolution arises in all sound but we feel it is permanent and fixed all of us who deny the sound as coming from one source
2472666 we dont want to stop people from enjoying a night out or a summer barbecue but we want people to do it safely and responsibly that means staying sober and alert if driving
2472667 but its important to think about the consequences to yourself and your family of being involved in a serious collision if you drink alcohol and then drive
2472668 you could end up in a wheelchair be killed or be responsible for the death of someone else

2472670 there are really two key parts to being well prepared psychologically and the first is knowing what those factors are
2472671 they need to know what they need to attend to what they need to think of what they need to focus on
2472672 athletes at this level know what these factors are but the key part is that they can manage themselves physiologically to allow that to happen
2472673 there is so much hype leading up to the olympics there are medal expectations and you cant block it all off completely
2472674 some people really handle the spotlight well and others dont
2472675 a sign of a true champion is one that excels when the lights are the strongest
2472676 when everyones rooting for you and you still do well that shows some very very strong mental will
2472677 the race is in his hands that takes a huge pressure off
2472678 ill go out there and give it 100 per cent but if i come third or tenth or if i trip and fall its in his hands
2472679 when im having fun thats when i race the best
2472680 its something we discussed to see if it was a good idea or not for him to carry the flag and of course he wanted to do that
2472681 so then we created a plan about how to manage that effectively its really thinking about how to be a professional going into the games
2472682 i think the pressure of competing in the olympics has always been the same but theres way more media now watching the olympics so theres probably more pressure from that perspective
2472683 they are competing against the some of the best players in the world are running the same distance
2472684 we remind them their opponents are just as nervous as they are
2472685 often well have meetings the night before to go over and remind them of what they want to be thinking of and the kind of emotional level they want to have
2472686 during the competition i have them write in their journals everyday their thoughts how they felt
2472687 its important so that they can understand all of their highs and lows

2472693 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2472694 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2472695 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2472696 taslimas six month visa to stay in india will expire on august 17

2472698 it is in the final stage i hope there will be a result very soon
2472699 es regnet noch immer stark und wir f rchten dass es weitere tote gibt der pegel des red river steigt rasch
2472700 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2472701 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2472702 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

2472706 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2472707 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2472708 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2472709 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2472710 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2472711 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2472712 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2472713 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2472714 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2472715 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

2472720 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2472721 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2472722 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

2472725 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2472726 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2472727 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

2472733 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2472734 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

2472741 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2472742 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2472743 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2472744 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2472745 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2472746 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2472747 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2472748 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2472749 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2472750 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2472751 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2472752 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2472753 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2472754 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2472755 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2472756 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2472757 gone a real physician with real patients who is really leaving ohio
2472758 frivolous lawsuits are driving up insurance rates by as much as 400 percent and driving good doctors like gary out of town or into early retirement
2472759 the simple answer is that insurance is regulated by the states
2472760 so state regulations play a major role in the cost of insurance
2472761 this is a line that insurance companies use all over the country
2472762 doctors in state a say theyre all leaving for state b while doctors in state b say theyre all leaving for state c
2472763 i dont know i dont claim to be an expert in this
2472764 there are a lot of people with their heads in the sand about whats going on here
2472765 gone a real physician with real patients who is really leaving ohio
2472766 frivolous lawsuits are driving up insurance rates by as much as 400 percent and driving good doctors like gary out of town or into early retirement
2472767 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2472768 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2472769 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2472770 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2472771 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2472772 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2472773 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2472774 who are open to doing something on the production side
2472775 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2472776 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2472777 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2472778 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2472779 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2472780 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2472781 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2472782 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2472783 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2472784 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2472785 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2472786 por ejemplo se ala erwin es com n que al llegar al hotel te den una habitaci n con dos camas individuales si ven que se trata de dos hombres o dos mujeres y cuando pides una habitaci n doble con una sola cama te ven con desprecio es decir te hacen dif cil un momento que deber a ser de lo m s normal para todos
2472787 a n hay que terminar con muchos prejuicios no es f cil que las empresas te reconozcan y se quieran involucrar pero es por falta de conocimiento

2472792 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2472793 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2472794 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2472795 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2472796 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2472797 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2472798 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2472799 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2472800 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2472801 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2472802 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2472803 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2472804 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2472805 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2472806 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2472807 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2472808 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2472809 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2472810 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2472811 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2472812 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2472813 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2472814 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2472815 well at least hes not as offensive as ann coulter
2472816 he felt he was making every attempt to help her get what she needed
2472817 said doyel who would not allow any of the frys employees involved in the incident to be interviewed
2472818 he the manager said he would fill it himself if we could get there before his shift ended within 10 minutes
2472819 but we were more than 10 minutes away so that was impossible so he said we would have to come back the next morning
2472820 actually they were caught with people who did need medical attention
2472821 thing is kid theres no law against providing medical transportation there is a law against furthering someones presence in the u s illegally
2472822 so whats the crime exactly oh yeah you dont have one you just hate immigrants and people who provide humaniarian aid
2472823 get back on an agenda of issues that are very important to the american people
2472824 if in fact a cit officer had even responded to the second call at the circle k theres no way a cit officer would have within one minute of arriving at the scene would have been trying to handcuff that person even if that person were a little bit violent they just dont aggravate these types of situation they would have tried to talk calmly with them reason with them
2472825 its the luck of the draw who goes out to those calls
2472826 i know it all about people i dont even know
2472827 do i offend you with my moniker good its meant to incite discussion about beliefs seeing it as anything else shows a narrow minded intolerant view
2472828 its also cute how you dont actually deny being a racist you just deny that i know youre a racist
2472829 it always seems that for political reasons we always back away from that
2472830 this could happen to anybody does that mean that anybody can make an assessment that youre undocumented and the police are going to act on it
2472831 except in this case the cops went after the wrong people mr
2472832 it was clear from what you quoted you claim that a fraction of a percent of people are liberal sorry buddy half the country voted for john kerry someone who you and the rest of the lunatic right have labeled as an america hating liberal extremist
2472833 some did and they got the cops called on them
2472834 the resources of the federal government can be better spent prosecuting people who pose a danger to our society and the two defendants in this case are not that
2472835 the best thing the government ever did for the sanctuary movement was indict the people
2472836 minutemen do not verbally contact physically gesture to or have any form of communications with suspected illegal aliens
2472837 if the report is corroborated it would confirm our suspicions that the minutemen are at best not well supervised and at worst inclined to take the law into their own hands including unlawfully detaining people who they think are undocumented immigrants
2472838 what we do know is that this individual was taken into custody but that the
2472839 letting the minutemen violate the law without accountability sends the signal that vigilante activity is welcome in new mexico this can lead to a very dangerous situation for migrants and new mexican residents alike
2472840 the essence of this case is that we must never get to the point where it is a crime to provide humanitarian aid
2472841 thats why we hope that the prosecutor will drop the charges that is why daniel and shanti didnt take a deal this isnt just a case about these two young people
2472842 amendment i congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free excercise thereof
2472843 when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of natures god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation
2472844 the senators and representatives before mentioned and the members of the several state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution
2472845 it was just what a month ago that you ran to your livejournal to complain that i was making fun of you
2472846 they chose not to include this in the constitution why exactly would they exclude god from the founding document of our form of government if they intended to make this a christian nation
2472847 oh right because they didnt want to do that despite your right wing rewriting of history my little troll
2472848 we all know sir bobbys not well although he will continue to battle on
2472849 if the supporters want it then thats what should happen no one knows better than them
2472850 i think it would be entirely consistent with the affection in which the town and the club hold sir bobby as was shown during the 30th anniversary celebration of the 1978 fc cup victory
2472851 i think renaming the north stand would be a really nice idea
2472852 hes been such a wonderful man for ipswich he is known and loved all around the country and we should be proud as ipswich people that hes part of our town and our club
2472853 the club has given sir bobby plenty of tributes in the past but this seems to be something that has come from the fans
2472854 its something people were discussing when the news broke that sir bobby has not got much time left
2472855 it makes sense that the north stand is the one thats being suggested because its a tribute from what the club has always referred to as the fans stand
2472856 if its something the fans want its something the club should consider
2472857 the club were delighted when sir bobby robson agreed to the galleria restaurant being renamed in his honour earlier this year
2472858 we know how proud he was and how pleased all supporters were to have the room named in this way
2472859 we are aware of the supporters petition and understand the sentiment and will give due consideration to their request
2472860 at this time as always we are wishing sir bobby the very best
2472861 im a norwich city fan its sad news about sir bobby hes done a lot and hes also been england manager hes the only ipswich town manager i respect
2472862 its a brilliant idea he was a first class manager for ipswich his work has been important to people who have got cancer it is very sad he has months to live hes a lovely man
2472863 its very sad news he is respected by the whole community im not an ipswich fan but he was a very good manager and he did a lot for the town when he was here
2472864 the north stand should definitely be named in his honour if not the whole stadium
2472865 its sad news hes a nice bloke they should rename the stand hes done so much for ipswich and he should be honoured he always supported ipswich
2472866 im a newcastle united fan i was quite shocked to hear the news about him its a good idea to rename the stand hes a nice bloke he was popular in newcastle as well i hope newcastle rename a stand or do something similar to honour him

2472875 as the sun rises and sets it snatches away the balance of our life span thus as each day passes each one of us loses some of lifes duration it is therefore said that the duration of ones life cannot be saved but if one is engaged in devotional service his time cannot be taken away by the sun as stated in srimad bhagavatam 2 3 17 ayur harati vai pumsam udyann astam ca yann asau the conclusion is that if one wants to make himself immortal he should give up sense gratification by engaging oneself in devotional service one can gradually enter into the eternal kingdom of god

2472923 there are really two key parts to being well prepared psychologically and the first is knowing what those factors are
2472924 they need to know what they need to attend to what they need to think of what they need to focus on
2472925 athletes at this level know what these factors are but the key part is that they can manage themselves physiologically to allow that to happen
2472926 there is so much hype leading up to the olympics there are medal expectations and you cant block it all off completely
2472927 some people really handle the spotlight well and others dont
2472928 a sign of a true champion is one that excels when the lights are the strongest
2472929 when everyones rooting for you and you still do well that shows some very very strong mental will
2472930 the race is in his hands that takes a huge pressure off
2472931 ill go out there and give it 100 per cent but if i come third or tenth or if i trip and fall its in his hands
2472932 when im having fun thats when i race the best
2472933 its something we discussed to see if it was a good idea or not for him to carry the flag and of course he wanted to do that
2472934 so then we created a plan about how to manage that effectively its really thinking about how to be a professional going into the games
2472935 i think the pressure of competing in the olympics has always been the same but theres way more media now watching the olympics so theres probably more pressure from that perspective
2472936 they are competing against the some of the best players in the world are running the same distance
2472937 we remind them their opponents are just as nervous as they are
2472938 often well have meetings the night before to go over and remind them of what they want to be thinking of and the kind of emotional level they want to have
2472939 during the competition i have them write in their journals everyday their thoughts how they felt
2472940 its important so that they can understand all of their highs and lows

2473064 thompson was a maverick journalist he is the creator of gonzo journalism that made reporters not just witnesses but central figures of their stories
2473065 we are looking for the american dream and we were told it was somewhere in this area
2473066 an optimist a dreamer always encouraging things to change but the anglo establishment exploited his talent in his case it was hunter thompson that guy stole brown buffalos gonzo style he turned it into mass produced merchandise
2473067 zeta was too weird to live and to rare to die
2473068 i guess it depends on whom you ask the older chicano generation has a deep affection for brown buffalo but young people know very little if anything about him t sabes they know almost nothing about el movimiento
2473069 a bawdy spunky conciousness to seek to subvert and turn ruling paradigms upside down it is a witty irreverent and impertinent posture that recodes and moves outside established boundaries rascuachismo is an underdog perspective
2473070 the art of making do with what youve got no matter how meager and turning it into something beautiful
2473071 rasquachismo or the rasquachi aesthetic all spellings are acceptable encompasses a shared memory system of performance elements grounded in a working class underdog perspective
2473072 ce un motivo pi importante degli altri per cui vorresti che i nirvana fossero ricordati
2473073 twee familieleden waren er het slachtoffer van een gewelddadige aanslag een persoon werd gedood en de andere zwaargewond de man handelde alleen en pleegde even later zelfmoord
2473074 we used to run the cls class but now they do the whole thing on their own
2473075 this is a very important step to improve relationships between the zoo and the people of iraq and it is proof that the security situation in iraq is getting better
2473076 theyre a real signature species people really identify with the beauty of the tigers
2473077 the zoo has been a real gem for the people here in iraq and the tigers will really add to that
2473078 i saw it as a good opportunity to give back to the iraqi people since iraq doesnt have any kind of childrens hospital set up yet i had access to this resource so why not help
2473079 my wife talked to the head nurse at her hospital and got the number to the wheelchair company
2473080 the company needed the girls dimensions so we had to get in contact with the family this enabled the best fit possible for the girl leaving her some room to grow
2473081 she can search females that are something males cant do
2473082 my mission is to find the females a job to work because right now in my association i have more than 950 without any job s
2473083 we have 10 females in balad that are actually able to search females coming into balad
2473084 this iraqi forces surge explains how we can continue to see very low levels of violence even though coalition forces have taken away a lot of combat power based
2473085 the operations in basra really instituted the rule of law there
2473086 the people there are able to live freely again without intimidation and extortion by militias
2473087 this cooperative effort which began july 27 partially destroyed the remnants of al qaida in iraq along the northern tigris river valley and brought a prolonged military presence to the people in those regions not seen in over three years
2473088 this is the first time that we have had iraqi security forces and coalition forces in hegnah because of their commitment to our people we are able to live in peace and begin rebuilding our lives without fear
2473089 we needed this conference to highlight the need for continued education in the health industry of al anbar
2473090 this was a once in a lifetime opportunity to meet with those doctors and lecture them on new information and practices
2473091 they have been to an extent cut off from the international medical community and theyre now starting to reestablish their relationships and medical knowledge their knowledge was pretty good considering what theyve been up against
2473092 without security they wouldnt able to hold these types of conferences and meetings
2473093 the iraqi police are continuing to protect their city we were basically there to make sure the iraqi police were doing what they already know how to do they did a great job
2473094 theres freedom in the united states it was like trading money for freedom but it would still be worth it
2473095 when the war kicked off my parents saw an opportunity to help out and give back to the united states
2473096 theyve both been to joint base balad and my mom just came back from bucca iraq god bless her soul
2473097 if we werent doing patrols it wouldnt be as calm as it is
2473098 in the end we are making a difference because were establishing control
2473099 we used to run the cls class but now they do the whole thing on their own
2473100 i think that its great that you have all come together to share what you have accomplished your ideas and the challenges you face ahead
2473101 it is eye opening experience for me to see what you ia leaders have gone through even though you dont have all of the resources you need you havent given up and you continue to try i commend you for your leadership and your continued effort to make things better for your soldiers
2473102 the people are so glad they have this soccer field again
2473103 before the reopening it seemed like everywhere i went somebody would always mention it to me and tell me how excited they were about the reopening soccer brings everybody together regardless of their age
2473104 everyone thought the soccer field would only have a positive impact on the north precinct of ramadi but after it was renovated everyone from the city started coming over here
2473105 it was originally built for the north district but really its for everybody the reopening has been big for the entire city
2473106 its been passed down from the regiment that there is a threat of insurgents utilizing oil smuggling to transport and fund their operations
2473107 these towns are like home ground for smuggling and were here to ensure it stops
2473108 most people in iraq want to live their lives in a safe and secure environment and if the enemy elements are invading the town the residents are in danger
2473109 when we put a dent in the oil smuggling and insurgency operations we thereby lay a dent in al qaida of iraq
2473110 denying al qaida access to the town will take away the opposition of the citys government and make it more effective
2473111 for the first time ive seen iraqi security forces that can plan prepare and execute first class offensive operations
2473112 ive also seen a high level of trust and respect by the people of rashid for their own army and police forces
2473113 together we conduct relentless offensive operations designed to kill capture or drive from rashid anyone who threatens the safety and security of the people we have sworn to protect
2473114 i believe this reduction in violence is a direct result of the conditions set by the success of the surge in forces and combat power
2473115 we built on this success and have seen a dramatic reduction in violence in the past four months
2473116 there is an increasing capability of the iraqi security forces
2473117 they have grown tremendously even in the 11 months weve been here the capability of the iraqi security force has certainly contributed both the army and the police the sons of iraq are part of the security elements in the northern provinces and they have helped in some areas like hawijah samarra and some other places
2473118 are starting to get their act together and providing jobs for people
2473119 a lot of the people in high level government positions remember swimming in this pool when they were children
2473120 there is a lot of pride associated with it in the community
2473121 we did our best to finish it in one month and it is a great job
2473122 there were a lot of people in the beginning who had doubts about the restoration of this historic landmark
2473123 thanks to a concerned citizen who provided the information on a potential vbied it was able to be secured without loss or injury to any civilians
2473124 because of citizens like the one who notified authorities of this potential deadly bomb the streets of adhamiyah remain a safe and prosperous place for residents
2473125 this shows that the residents of this once volatile neighborhood will not tolerate those actions any longer
2473126 those who support terrorism will be targeted whether they be recruiters financiers or those who carry out the attacks
2473127 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured
2473128 we need further investigation to find out the motive since the man has killed himself we have no more information to provide for the moment
2473129 the president has been informed and his heart goes out to the families of the victims
2473130 the white house and u s embassy have offered whatever assistance the family needs u s officials have also been in touch with chinese authorities on the matter
2473131 were actively following the situation right now and u s embassy officials are already at the hospital

2473146 then he went out to west lothian to meet up with a few lads for a game of
2473147 look mommy hes fill in the blank with some distinguishing physical characteristic
2473148 different in some way even someone they are familiar with the childs response to the person may change
2473149 newness when he advances on her to give her a hug she reacts as she would to anyone she didnt know who was suddenly acting overly familiar and getting too close for comfort
2473150 reconciliation in the relationship needs to take place on her terms
2473151 trying to turn 2008 into a year of mourning and a year of terror
2473152 it clearly was not the act of a balanced or rational person
2473153 in medieval times the compostela tourist industry pitched its wares in lavacolla documents tell us that just like todays merchants 12thc composteleans posted advertisements in a variety of languages touting the virtues and prices of their inns restaurants and taverns advance men from the hospices accosted weary excited pilgrims with tales of how the scarcity of lodgings in the city required them to make decisions about and payment for lodgings on the spot

2473171 ive worked in front of 20 000 yes theres always nerves but not as bad as here

2473190 during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant
2473191 they were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2473192 out of respect for the families involved we cant say more than that
2473193 the greatest joy i feel is for the 60 or 75 minutes when im on stage
2473194 being on stage takes away the numbing buzzing drone that goes on on a daily basis
2473195 but im also incredibly excited and grateful we played the montreaux jazz festival and afterward joan baez made a comment to me about being really impressed and pleased to share the stage with me and i thought youve got it all wrong its the other way around completely its such a humbling experience
2473196 i had to learn to play the guitar and try to remember what i had done
2473197 that was tough because i had memory problems i only started singing because i thought that if i hummed the notes i was playing it would help me remember them eventually i started uttering words
2473198 i literally have to learn my songs after ive recorded them
2473199 its kind of bizarre i have to relearn my songs before every show
2473200 without sounding like a sentimental sap it continues to be a surprising journey at the end of the montreal jazz festival my heart was so full i thought it was going to burst they gave us massive ovations we came out to say thank you and i just started to cry it was such a beautiful thing
2473201 it tastes excellent not unlike venison only a different flavour
2473202 we thoroughly enjoyed the house it definitely got five stars from us we liked the way it had been rennovated and everything was sparkling clean when we arrived highlights included sunbathing on the terrace reading in the hammock and sleeping in very late thanks to a combination of the shutters and remarkably comfortable bed linens we did a lot of cooking in the kitchen and found everything we needed we also enjoyed the area and would thoroughly recommend that your later guests try a meal at the restaurant below the castle in najac
2473203 your place was lovely very peaceful and just what we needed we thought you had renovated it really nicely and it had everything we needed we spent a lot of time driving around and visiting the villages which were completely unexpected and gorgeous all the best for the future
2473204 it tastes excellent not unlike venison only a different flavour
2473205 i cant believe he didnt make the all star team
2473206 it was close i had nothing left in the tank i was going full speed
2473207 the next thing you know its four runs weve had that happen more that once
2473208 weve got to keep going out and playing the best way we know how
2473209 at the beginning of the 21st century in italy where is known as connettivismo it originated in italian science fiction as an initiative of a group of writers

2473217 in the short term an indium atomic beam will be laser collimated to enhance the beam flux and reduce the transverse velocity of indium atoms in the beam which is the requirement to generate narrow structures
2473218 in the long term a source of single indium atoms may be constructed to generate structures more accurately on an atom by atom basis
2473219 she decided to accept the position and i supported her
2473220 after she assumed her new position i preferred to be a research professor at the university keeping a significant amount of time available for entrepreneurial activities
2473221 we are beginning to produce nanomaterials that can be used very effectively for biosensors and medical applications

2473225 sow a thought and you reap an action sow an action and you reap a habit sow a habit and you reap a character sow a character and you reap a destiny
2473226 and do not be conformed to this world this age fashioned after and adapted to its external superficial customs but be transformed changed by the entire renewal of your mind by its new ideals and its new attitude that you may prove for yourselves what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of god even the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect in his sight for you
2473227 undergoing a complete change which under the power of god will find expression in character and conduct morphe lays stress on the inward change schema the word translated as conformed here lays stress on the outward the present continuous tenses indicated a process
2473228 half of spiritual growth is learning what we do not know the other half is unlearning what we do know and it is the failure to unlearn irrational fears and misconceptions that keeps us from becoming who god wants us to be faith is unlearning the senseless worries and misguided beliefs that keep us captive we are literally upgrading our minds by downloading the mind of christ like a computer the way to upgrade your mind is to download scripture then we stop thinking human thoughts and start thinking god thoughts
2473229 some of the problems of todays globalized world could be eliminated or reduced by developing operational worldwide molecular design and manufacturing capabilities
2473230 what were finding is that control of the lithographic imaging process is no longer the limiting step material issues such as line sidewall roughness are now a major barrier to still finer length scales however there are several new technologies on the horizon that have the potential for alleviating these problems these results demonstrate that theres still a lot of room left for scale shrinkage in optical lithography we dont see any insurmountable roadblocks just yet
2473231 all attempts to contact her have failed it is feared that zeng has been taken into police custody and might be mistreated
2473232 as the olympics open in beijing it is believed that zeng was taken away to ensure that no journalists will have access to her and that she will be unable to speak out about hu jia during the games
2473233 with the players that had pulled out there were a lot of last minute changes and with the time difference to the states a lot of paperwork wasnt getting received until 15 hours later finally it all came together on wednesday afternoon
2473234 theres so much fighting in the world and yet when the olympics come around its amazing its just a great atmosphere
2473235 my goal this year has been to keep getting better
2473236 i feel like when i focus on that it helps me substantially more than when im out there trying to win and getting worried about winning or losing it helps me be more free on the court which has been a real positive
2473237 over the past five or six years i definitely appreciate more the travel we get to do and the places we go see
2473238 i make a point of going out and seeing things you have to mentally too because it helps break up the day to get your mind off tennis
2473239 ive learned to appreciate the type of lifestyle i have
2473240 i just didnt have any more strength in the legs
2473241 i had a terrible headache i dont know where it came from probably the pollution
2473242 it feels like youre at 3 000 metres because of the air you cannot breathe the air is thick and there is smog but wednesday is another day and i hope to have recovered for the time trial right now im just knackered
2473243 it was more than 40 degrees at the start there was lots of headwind and what with the jet lag the humidity and the heat it was extremely difficult
2473244 i was worried about the weather the humidity the heat and possible dehydration
2473245 since the tour de france i have been here today the heat had gone a bit compared to last week and it felt much better
2473246 im very satisfied with the teams performance but this is just the ranking round so they wont be too concerned about it
2473247 actually they werent thinking about breaking the olympic record either but in the end they did
2473248 a few things went wrong there but im still going in as fastest qualifier and i still have some things to improve on
2473249 its obviously a lot faster being at night and being an olympic event its going to be a lot tougher
2473250 im happy with that and i know i can keep going and keep on improving
2473251 i did not understand why the point was not given to me
2473252 i was surprised when i saw the scoreboard i knew this was my point
2473253 i knew it was going to be a tough one we know each other well
2473254 hes had a good day and i really havent felt up to it
2473255 our girls were challenged by the fact we have never played belarus
2473256 for us it was a significant game and i think our recent loss in the diamond ball against the usa helped prepare us for today
2473257 were just chipping away at a number of got quite a few things to work on but i thought we executed pretty well
2473258 we have so much more to give our chances are extremely high at these come here to take home gold
2473259 for naked physical talent theyre clearly the best team theyre quicker stronger and they run great
2473260 there will be no pressure when playing the the only team that has something to lose
2473261 that was a little bit of luck but ill take it
2473262 this is a great start but its a long regatta
2473263 past olympians have told me to really enjoy this experience i take that to heart
2473264 you couldnt just go by rules of thumb because it was always changing we had to make pretty big decisions and not all of them were right
2473265 the first race is a great example of that where i was in the lead and the breeze shut down and came in from a different direction and i lost 10 places
2473266 its something i think were all going to have to deal with here its going to happen to everyone at some stage its just about trying to keep your powder dry and wait for your chances
2473267 my own experience with the olympics has always been having a disastrous first day so it doesnt feel quite so bad hopefully i can build from this in due course
2473268 its definitely a patience game especially in the light winds
2473269 we could have easily given up on the first race but we knew we had to keep going and it all came good

2473473 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2473474 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2473475 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2473476 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2473477 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2473478 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2473479 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2473480 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2473527 we conclude that the final judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil acts what we have done it is an acknowledgment of the final effect of our acts and thoughts what we have become it is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions the commandments ordinances and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account the gospel of jesus christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our heavenly father desires us to become
2473528 for this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man
2473529 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the suferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us
2473530 the word of god jesus christ our lord who because of his immeasurable love became what we are in order to make us what he is
2473531 god became man so that we might be made gods
2473532 are my usual thoughts and present actions worthy of eternal life am i setting my sights on eternal goals and working to obtain them
2473533 happiness is the object and design of our existence and will be the end thereof if we pursue the path that leads to it and this path is virtue uprightness faithfulness holiness and keeping all the commandments of god
2473534 we conclude that the final judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil acts what we have done it is an acknowledgment of the final effect of our acts and thoughts what we have become
2473535 the worst fear that i have about this people is that they will get rich and forget god this people will stand mobbing robbing poverty and all manner of persecution and be true but my greater fear for them is that they cannot stand wealth
2473536 the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ
2473537 adversity comes to use from different sources some times just as a result of the mortal experience but other times it comes as a result of decisions made by you or those close to you your success and happiness both now and in the eternities depend largely on your responses to these difficulties of life

2473602 ob das latvala ist oder hirvonen oder aava als este sie haben einfach von der geografie her einen vorteil das land ist pr destiniert f r gute rallye und endurofahrer weil du berall die gleichen gegebenheiten hast und die jungs damit aufwachsen da tut man sich einfach als nicht skandinavier von vornherein schon schwer
2473603 f r mich hat s bastien mikko in finnland vom kopf her geschlagen und zwar in der weltmeisterschaft
2473604 mikko wei jetzt ganz genau hoppla bei mir geht es nur noch ums punkten punkten punkten und wenn s bastien kein problem hat dann werde ich wieder nicht weltmeister mikko wurde in finnland geschlagen und das hat meiner meinung nach f r ihn eine negative auswirkung f r die wm und den rest des jahres
2473605 der spitzname ist bei der bmw fitnesswoche 2007 entstanden dort haben wir die unterschiedlichsten tests absolviert unter anderem standen klimmz ge auf dem programm die anderen jungs lieferten sich bei 25 ein hartes duell zu dieser zeit war ich aber schon bei 50 klimmz gen damals hatte ich auch noch l ngeres haar so dass ich sylvester stallone wirklich ein wenig hnlich sah
2473606 nat rlich ist in einem tourenwagen die belastung auf die nackenmuskulatur nicht so hoch wie etwa in der formel
2473607 allerdings muss man dennoch topfit sein um den hohen temperaturen im cockpit trotzen zu k nnen deshalb treibe ich viel sport laufen und radfahren geh ren zu meinem programm aber auch regelm iges kartfahren ist anstrengend und h lt fit au erdem gehe ich h ufig in die sauna um an die hitze gew hnt zu sein
2473608 um auch in der letzten runde noch voll angreifen zu k nnen
2473609 muss man voll und ganz auf seine kr fte vertrauen k nnen
2473610 f r mich ist und bleibt das joggen die beste m glichkeit mich in form zu halten um denselben trainingseffekt etwa auf dem fahrrad zu erzielen ist einfach deutlich mehr zeit n tig drei mal w chentlich 45 minuten laufen damit tun sie ihrem k rper einen gefallen und das beste man kann diesen sport auch betreiben wenn man unterwegs ist das ist sicher nicht nur f r mich als rennfahrer wichtig
2473611 aus herstellersicht muss die formel 1 die spitze der technologie darstellen
2473612 ich wei nicht ob wir den leuten wirklich vorgaukeln sollten dass wir da etwas entwickeln was sich im stra enauto wieder findet
2473613 aber wenn kers dabei helfen kann ein effizientes energie sparendes auto mehr sexy erscheinen zu lassen und f r machos interessant zu machen und nicht nur bei leuten die ko sandalen tragen dann hat es etwas bewirkt
2473614 wer meint kers sei nicht relevant trifft den punkt nicht
2473615 es geht dabei auch um die ausbildung von ingenieuren und der l sung einer langfristig wichtigen aufgabe wird sich unser formel 1 system im honda civic wieder finden wahrscheinlich nicht aber einige der gedanken und technologien werden bestimmt einflie en k nnen
2473616 wenn kers dabei helfen kann ein energie sparendes auto mehr sexy erscheinen zu lassen dann hat es etwas bewirkt
2473617 es geht das ger cht um dass die keine ahnung haben warum es passiert ist das macht uns sorgen
2473618 ich denke schon dass man das schnell auf die reihe kriegt weil da gro e hersteller im hintergrund sind
2473619 das ganze kann man auf dem pr fstand entwickeln das muss man nicht allzu viel fahren um das in die reihe zu bekommen das kann man alles theoretisch durchspielen und dann funktioniert das irgendwann es wird dann eingebaut und dann geht es nur noch um temperaturen vibrationen und wie es sich im auto verh lt ich glaube dass wir da zu viel panik machen das wird funktionieren davon bin ich berzeugt
2473620 ich sehe das so fr her war die feuergefahr in der formel 1 ein riesiges thema man hat dann tanks vorgeschrieben mit ventilen die automatisch schlie en wenn etwas austritt heutzutage ist das feuer berhaupt kein thema mehr
2473621 wenn es mal an der box brennt dann ist das nur ein paar sekunden und dann ist es auch wieder weg man hat das feuer in den griff bekommen und nun wird man die elektrizit t also die batterien in den griff bekommen nat rlich br uchte solch ein auto eine erdung das m sste man vorschreiben das war bei dem zwischenfall ja das hauptproblem
2473622 dass da batterien explodieren und was sonst noch ist doch nur im anfangsstadium
2473623 das kriegt man in den griff fr her war die hohe spritmenge im auto das gr te problem wir haben deswegen viele piloten verloren weil die autos gebrannt haben heute ist das kein thema mehr genauso bekommt man jetzt die elektrizit t in den griff
2473624 can believe anything you have no idea what i can believe
2473625 i can believe things that are true and i can believe things that arent true and i can belive things where nobody knows if theyre true or not i can believe in santa clause and the easter bunny and marilyn monroe and the beatles and mister ed listen i believe that people are perfectible that knowledge is infinite that the world is run by secret banking cartels and is visited by aliens on a regular basis nice ones that look like wrinkledy lemurs and bad one who mutilate cattle and want our water and our women i believe that the future sucks and i believe that the future rocks and i believe that one day white buffalo woman is going to come back and kick everyones ass i believe that all men are just overgrown boys with deep problems communicating and that the decline in good sex in america is coincident with the decline in drive in movie theaters from state to state i believe that all politicians are unprincipled crooks and i still believe that they are better then the alternative i believe that california is going to sink into the sea when the big one comes while florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste i believe that antibacterial soap is destroying our resistance to dirt and disease so that one day well all be wiped out by the common cold like the martians in war of the worlds i believe that the greatest poets of the last century were edith sitwell and don marquis that jade is dried dragon sperm and that thousands of years ago in a former life i was a one armed siberian shaman i believe that candy really did taste better when i was a kid that its aerodynamically impossible for a bumblebee to fly that light is a wave and a particle that theres a cat in a box somewhere whos alive and dead at the same time although if they dont ever open the box to feed it itll eventually just be two different kinds of dead and that there are stars in the universe billions of years older then the universe itself i believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversee everything i do i believe in an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesnt even know im alive i believe in an empty and godless universe of causal chaos background noise and sheer blind luck i believe that anyone who says sex is overrated hasnt done it properly i believe that anyone who claims to know whats going on will lie about the little things too i believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies i believe in a womans right to choose a babys right to live that while all human life is sacred theres nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly and that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system i believe that life is a game that life is a cruel joke and that life is what happens when youre alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it

2473638 take comfort in your faith suffering builds character and the lord suffered too he will comfort you in heaven you will have many mansions but in the meantime we will give you as much help as possible and try to console you
2473639 the reason you are poor is the unjust distribution of wealth the greediness of the rich and their domination of the government and power structures of society if we can pass laws to change the situation by taking from the rich and giving to the poor we can eventually help you help us to pass just laws or if that fails form a revolution where you will eventually rule and then the wealth will be equally distributed have patience the government will eventually change your situation
2473640 if you will believe the gospel the lord will immediately break the power of sin in your life and you can be filled and empowered by the holy spirit to speak in tongues cast out devils and evangelize the world you can be instantly set free from your addictions to alcohol tobacco sexual promiscuity and drugs and jesus will make you into a healthy honest member of society god is not against you there is no virtue in being poor just for the sake of being poor so god will also bless you materially as you work hard live honestly save your money and give a portion of your own income to others

2473750 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state reloaded not comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2473751 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2473752 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian disaster is gathering pace
2473753 information needs to be put on networks we have a huge repository of information which needs not only be computerized but uploaded on an intelligent network that be accessed by people through video conferencing mobile phones and computers
2473754 we are still living in same setup we need to come out of it and get the information up and accessible
2473755 you know how difficult it is to enter government offices people need not travel all the way delhi for any information or even attending courts they should do it from their rural centers which can me made possible by technologies like video conferencing
2473756 in fact a few companies have approached us but unless the hearing is complete and we conduct study on the capabilities of those companies no decision can be taken
2473757 cannot say that gbbn has delayed the project as the states data centre at porvorim is being operationalised and the applications which are developed for departments are being loaded and tested
2473758 gbbn has affected to some extent but we also have other alternatives like the bsnl and tulip who have approached us to provide service
2473759 we have taken up only the service oriented departments for the computerization
2473760 the objective of the department is far from achieved with the blockage of projects which is a result of corruption and favouritism
2473761 as of now all government departments should have been computerised but nothing seems to be moving
2473762 we were trying different things we were smoking funny things

2473770 for three decades i have tried to imagine how it might be possible to build a car that engine with three electric motors one to power the rear wheels and two for the specially designed propellers
2473771 its a tradition that we produce a concept car for the geneva motor show
2473772 we dont plan to build it even in a limited capacity

2473778 lift a conference about the challenges and opportunities of technology in our society
2473779 we want simplicity cry the people befuddled by all the features of their latest whatever do they really mean it no
2473780 this hotlist comprises the prevailing tendencies permeating research product development and service design within the field of information technology

2473782 a thematic network of researchers and practitioners from many backgrounds computer science human sciences design business developing a broad discipline of human centered design of digital systems for everday life
2473783 the digitizing of information the rapid rise of digital information systems and increased access to those systems by a broad range of people have challenged the way in which we look at specialists and the roles they play
2473784 worldchanging works from a simple premise that the tools models and ideas for building a better future lie all around us
2473785 companies will need to embrace these principles in product design and marketing and understand the emerging technologies that will be needed to support these values if they hope to align with consumer needs and desires now and in the future
2473786 emotion is now widely recognised as an indisputable ingredient of the human product relationship
2473787 introduces the concept of user interface friction another measure to gauge the quality of the user experience
2473788 we need our technologies to aid us not control us we need more devices that act as servants as assistants and as collaborators it is time for a humane technology
2473789 the design interactions department at the royal college of art explores new roles contexts and approaches for design in relation to the social cultural and ethical impact of existing and emerging technologies
2473790 there are a series of issues that come up in every job that we do and characterize the changing nature of consumers
2473791 when i refer to the empathic economy im talking about a future possibility in which a similar level of empathy and imagination might be applied to the many different kinds of people who populate the business ecology of a particular industry not just customers end users consumers
2473792 as a psychologist whos spent over 30 years focusing on human experience its exciting to see so much energetic interest in understanding users experiences and designing environments that lead to desired user and customer experiences
2473793 does my work really matter to anyone do i make a difference in any meaningful way
2473794 information processing embedded in the objects and surfaces of everyday life
2473795 those of us who have contributed to the new science of cybernetics thus stand in a moral position which is to say the least not very comfortable
2473796 jakob nielsen looks at the unbalance between active contributors and
2473797 all large scale multi user communities and online social networks that rely on users to contribute content or build services share one property most users dont participate very much
2473798 for most of us using a computer and surfing the web is an almost entirely visual experience we move cursors around the screen click buttons and menus read text and look at pictures
2473799 we dont negate the intuitive part of the design process
2473800 george olsen draws from his own experience to suggest that human centered design techniques have merits but also inherent limits when developing
2473801 for user experience designers some of the most exciting projects to work on are new to the world or breakthrough products that solve real problems people didnt even realize they had

2473811 the world is changing and old approaches to design and business arent working as well as they used to
2473812 emotions arise towards people towards places towards food and towards things emotions influence our well being as well as our purchase decisions
2473813 it is no longer a question of predicting the future but of collectively shaping and designing it
2473814 luke wroblewski looks at how simplicity often hailed as the holy grail of interface design is quite hard to get right if at all
2473815 many of us carry a few preconceived notions about simplicity we assume things that are easy to use dont have a lot of options and as a result shouldnt appear cluttered when we first encounter them conversely a perception of complexity can turn customers clients or business stakeholders off before they ever actually use a product cultural context can also sway peoples perceptions of simplicity regardless of the specific biases of individuals notions of perceived complexity can prevent potential users from discovering the simplicity of a products actual use while there are many reasons why keeping things simple is difficult ive encountered the following three causes quite frequently 1 perceived simplicity can often conflict with actual simplicity of usage 2 actions that provide real value and drive revenue often have formidable learning curves 3 gradual engagement the most frequently cited solution for managing complexity is actually quite difficult to design and build
2473816 when microsoft hired me eight years ago as the first official anthropologist they werent sure what to do with me so they had me design my own job
2473817 dont frame the question by designing for illiterate people think about the skills that are necessary to use the core features on a device something which we term device competency
2473818 andreas pfeiffer describes the 10 fundamental rules for the age of user experience technology
2473819 one key aspect of modern digital devices is that technical specifications are easily copied and replicated mega pixel count in cameras storage capacity in music players or processor speed in personal computers are the same everywhere as a result they provide only poor distinguishing factors for consumers when it comes to choosing between different brands thats where the overall user experience comes in
2473820 in this new age customer experience will decide the winners and losers in almost every industry imaginable
2473821 participatory design pd is a design framework and related methods which advocate user involvement in design
2473822 ambient findability describes a world at the crossroads of ubiquitous computing and the internet in which we can find anyone or anything from anywhere at anytime
2473823 since the late 1980s computer scientists and engineers have been researching ways of embedding computational intelligence into the built environment
2473824 the aim is to create a high profile design institute which is small but dynamic and which interfaces with academia and industry
2473825 natural interaction investigates the relationships between humans and machines following this vision we create interactive artifacts that respect and exploit the natural dynamics through which people communicate and discover the real world
2473826 there is a growing realization that we are no longer designing products web sites or monolithic centralized systems
2473827 don norman advocates against depersonalizing those we design for by calling them with terms that overly simplify the complexity of the many roles they play
2473828 in user experience design i think the main thing is that rather than just designing an object you take a more holistic approach
2473829 user centered design works well we have good office information systems hci is a solid discipline
2473830 idea 2006 brings together a diverse set of designers creators and researchers addressing a fundamental challenge were facing today how to let everyday people take true advantage of the overwhelming mass of information that floods their lives
2473831 human behavior seldom follows mathematical logic and reasoning by the standards of engineers human behavior can be illogical and irrational
2473832 dan hill has gathered his thought provoking ideas on the role that
2473833 essentially all products lives start when in the hands of the consumer long after the designer has waved bye bye design is a social process this reinforces the idea of adaptation as a basic human desire this should really be a question of can products be purposefully made more or less hackable if we are to invite the user in we need to leave some of the seams and traces open for others to explore some sense of what the process of design or un design might entail this is beyond affordances which concern predefined usage this sense that the fabric of the product should communicate its constituent parts and how they are assembled runs counter to invisible computing thinking and much user centred design which argues that interfaces should get out of the way as the distinction between hardware and software blurs their behaviour approaches the malleability of software arguably the most interesting things about these emerging products and devices is their ability to create or contribute towards a sense of self there is huge potential to build devices which become increasingly personally meaningful which can adapt to personal context and preference like never before this requires that the products have at least some understanding of both their own behaviour essentially tracking their behaviour usage patterns and context wherever possible and are built by both designers researchers who understand the social in depth and can ultimately be adapted by their own users in adaptive design designers must enable the experience object to learn and users to be able to teach the experience object so its a two way interaction in which the user wants to adapt the product to make it useful to him or her designers shouldnt aim to control but to enable

2473849 reporters interviewed me this morning when our story is published it will become a hot issue the owner of the trawler wanted to settle the matter by paying us off but the whole village refused the four men are now in police lock up
2473850 when we first came here 19 years ago there were so many problems we didnt know where to start but we were determined to help out so we stayed on and slowly learned from the villagers and gained their trust
2473851 yadfon creates a learning process we are not standing in front and teaching we give equal respect and learn from each other to create something new

2473853 whenever a prominent malay leader articulates non malay grievances the chinese and indian anti establishment vote shoots up significantly it is as if they are encouraged even emboldened by the stance of the malay leader
2473854 my health deteriorated i felt feverish i had oral thrush and fungal infections which caused red spots all over my legs i became so thin and i looked like a sick person sick with aids and i was ashamed to be seen i felt like there was no future for us
2473855 my children used to have skin disease they were weak and they were sick all the time i worried for them but now they have normal lives they go to school like normal kids look at my skin now and the colour on my face my friends dont even believe i have aids
2473856 i was told by the doctor that i had fungus in my brain i took herbal medications and after that i couldnt eat or swallow or get up and i had this constant terrible headache i also lost a lot of weight i felt like i was dying
2473857 i was never unfaithful to my wife so we think it was the blood transfusion at the time when i was sick my wife was earning 90 baht about rm9 a day shelling oysters she had to borrow money to pay for my medication and support the family
2473858 i still could not ride my motorbike or run but i gained 11kg from 41kg to 52kg my headaches stopped i am still taking v1 and i can work like a normal healthy person i ride my motorcycle now to pick up the tablets from chonburi
2473859 the goal is to find a medicine that does not give bad side effects other drugs that have been developed to fight aids cause damage to the liver heart and the kidneys it weakens the immune system and the patients look even sicker how can you fight the virus when you are sick
2473860 i am not saying v1 is a miracle drug what it does is to boost the immune system to fight the virus it is giving hope to people
2473861 we should give thai people opportunities to develop a vaccine
2473862 we are seeing an 85 efficacy rate that has never been seen in any aids drug or vaccine
2473863 if you are a terminal aids patient and you took v1 instead of being dead within two months you have a more than 50 chance of surviving past two months your chance of being alive is still in the 15 range even after one year
2473864 no antiviral drug in the world today can match that effect the most advanced antiviral combination therapy in full blown aids patients showed that 16 of treated patients had died versus 23 of patients who were untreated and placed on placebo that means the difference attributable to antiviral drugs was only 7 whereas in the v1 study which dealt with much sicker patients the difference was between zero and 56 6 survival
2473865 one still visits me and thats after two years from the study
2473866 in my 20 years of research into vaccines i have never seen anything like that
2473867 but with v1 i see the patients getting well and returning to normal life instead of dying they go back to work this is not by chance this is because of the product
2473868 as a government officer we survive under a big conflict i am not as strong as dr orupan
2473869 multinationals put in billions to develop and promote a drug for v1 vitchai has managed to develop it with half a million this is an exciting discovery that has laid enough groundwork for more support to come in
2473870 access to what to whom by whom and at what costs and consequences
2473871 there is vested interest and the element of profit over the healthcare of people who are in need
2473872 what do you tell doctors who have people queuing up for highly active antiretrovirals haart and there is none available there must be something between haart and palliative care treatments that yield benefits to patients must be given the same amount of attention and funding as arvs
2473873 when does science begins at what point does practice become science what do we mean by evidence whose philosophical approach are we using when we define efficacy and evidence
2473874 the review committee for abstracts needs to be renewed to represent the diversities from the ground
2473875 sub standard products whose effectiveness as a cure for hiv aids had been exaggerated
2473876 the commissions decision was made in the interest of consumers this food additive does not possess the benefits or qualities that have been advertised
2473877 the alleged advertisement is an interview that was conducted by a reporter from a local thai paper the final printed story is false and does not reflect my viewpoint
2473878 there is a fine distinction between cure and treatment but in the thai language there is none we have always said that more research is needed but what we have found is that blood tests of some patients have shown that the virus is no longer detectable in the blood
2473879 the only study that was ever done by the government on v1 was a half hearted attempt to measure its efficacy conducted on 40 patients in june last year
2473880 well the journals can publish what they want i personally dont buy it the ministry is worried that the people are losing time in taking this food supplement instead of the antivirals which is the standard treatment
2473881 he vallop said that i was cheating the public with my studies he accused without basis that my studies were done poorly i am still waiting for him to point out which part of my study was not done properly
2473882 i have been put under investigation for almost two months but i havent been called to answer any charges in fact i dont even know what the charge is they need to announce what they have found in their investigation because my professional reputation is at stake
2473883 v1 is a product of the thai people the government has a duty to investigate the vaccine scientifically as thailand is facing a pandemic with one million people infected with hiv
2473884 im worried for the 16 000 thai volunteers who will be used as guinea pigs on a vaccine that americans wont allow to be tested on themselves
2473885 i have come to support dr orupan and v1 because i am one of the patients who have become negative after taking v1
2473886 five years ago when my husband and i started to get full blown aids we were very ill and we had contemplated suicide we felt hopelessness because it is a disease without cure but after taking v1 we can lead normal lives now
2473887 we want to urge the government to recognise v1 as a medicine to fight aids if v1s licence is revoked the people of thailand would stand to lose
2473888 there are one million infected people in thailand and more than 55 000 who die every year from aids i would not be standing here if it was not for v1
2473889 as khoo clansmen my family members have lived here for 102 years and it has been my home since i was five i am not used to living anywhere else
2473890 i hope the government is not successful in getting penang into the list so that we dont have to move out we were told by the khoo kongsi trustees that it is a government initiative and how can we go against the government
2473891 it would be hard for both parties the trustees and his family as tenants
2473892 to be fair the trustees are also helping us look for a new home and have compensated my mother with rm5 000
2473893 the worst thing you can do is to take the people out and let them tinker with handicrafts for the entertainment of tourists
2473894 we are studying it now we realise that landlords dont want to spend money to repair their properties only to rent it out to tenants and the 4 interest on the loans is no longer competitive as it is even higher than what is offered by some banks
2473895 the state government only owns 11 of land on the island and 9 is hilly land and water catchment areas the 2 on flat land is predominantly occupied by government offices
2473896 it is not that developers are not supportive of heritage conservation most of the developers and chinese businesses in town are either illiterate or they speak chinese but the language of heritage conservation is english
2473897 there is a lack of information many dont even know where the actual area is the information we get is from the grapevine there is also a lack of trust as we feel that things are being planned quietly and then suddenly they are revealed and were supposed to live with it
2473898 for towns pursuing tourism promotion as part of their development strategy statistics have shown that within two years after world heritage inscription the number of visitor arrivals increased by 40 and grew steadily at a rate double that experienced by sites not on the world heritage list
2473899 a world heritage city attracts invaluable intellectual capital as in the case of barcelona and prevents brain drain to other less desirable locations it is the surest reason to pursue heritage conservation as a long term development strategy
2473900 it is important for us to look at east timor as an independent country and we will continuously build up the relationship based on this
2473901 the implications of recent events concerning east timor beg us to look into the meaning of the non interference principle which malaysia held to during the 24 years of indonesian domination he says
2473902 it was not morally proper to support the east timorese struggle at the expense of the non interference policy until the outcome of the 1999 referendum which showed the real intention of the people he argues
2473903 we have always supported indonesia when east timor was its territory and now when it has ceased to be we have always been consistent with our policy says kamal ismaun under secretary for south east asia and south pacific division at wisma putra
2473904 east timor has gone through some very tragic events and it is time to rebuild it
2473905 asean must take a stronger stand on issues of human rights abuses it must respond to calls for help by people in troubled areas within asean
2473906 the policy of non interference is good in that it prevents conflict at government level but it should not be taken to such an extreme at the cost of human lives asean should be flexible and tolerant of mutual criticisms
2473907 raising issues of greater democratisation and giving its views to overcome problems and conflicts in another member country should not be seen as interference in the internal affairs of another country he says
2473908 lately it has come under close scrutiny as a result of what happened in east timor kosovo and other parts of africa but in my opinion the principle should still stand he says
2473909 but it must not be done by commenting negatively he says
2473910 the question is would asean make a commitment to allow for more democratic space and solidarity among its people
2473911 you dont need a marriage course you dont need to seek the brides parents permission or to let your old wife know all you need to know is how to lafaz utter the intention to wed a woman
2473912 they even served us tea and kuih cakes they looked a bit puzzled perhaps because of our age difference but never asked us anything about why we were getting married
2473913 all that was needed was our ics so they could put our names down the fee was rm200
2473914 yes you could get married inside the shop or you could go to the ustazs home its just around the corner
2473915 you can come back tomorrow because the ustaz is in patani today anyway the whole thing can be completed in half an hour
2473916 not a few cases where there was already the seed inside the womans womb
2473917 sometimes we feel pressured into marrying the couple as they will be spending the night together in thailand before going home marrying them as husband and wife before such a situation occurs would prevent them from sinning
2473918 if marriages were solemnised by these unauthorised persons then they were conducted without the consent of the songkhla religious authorities in songkhla there are 25 kadis and their deputies who have been given tauliah authority in yala there are four the lists of authorised kadis have been given to the perlis islamic council
2473919 send your men to the border and attack all those polygamy peddlers it is for your own good name and the image of islam in thailand that you must do this
2473920 we cant get the police here to catch these culprits some of these culprits belong to syndicates all we can do is to ask malaysia to tell their people not to fall for these bogus kadis who are unable to issue the proper documents
2473921 relaxing laws to match thailands is not the answer the solution is to make men respect the syariah courts and the laws you cant allow them to run off to the border to escape the law enforce the rm1 000 fine and six months jail sentence and see the difference that can make
2473922 malay race have in common is that they professed the islamic faith
2473923 malay identity was not discussed at length during the colloquium but panellist yusuff azmi merican a former teacher in his frank presentation about the jawi peranakans shared his experience on the disappearing cultures
2473924 id never bothered to look at my birth cert until the marriage of my son he needed my birth cert and when i found it in the drawers of an old cupboard i was actually shocked to find that i was identified as a jawi peranakan he said during the oral history panel of the colloquium
2473925 mamaks indian muslims forgot about being mamaks arabs forget about being arabs and we all came together to establish umno to fight for independence
2473926 we may have forgotten our differences and have all come together as malays but let us not forget the roles of these people in the development of penang and the country
2473927 this is an enduring colonialist legacy which had been defended by a narrow nationalistic interpretation of the malay race the prejudicial identity of the pure malay brought about an administrative ethnic cleansing which extinguished the history of other non malay inhabitants of the land
2473928 the shirt is called baju kancing prak and the coat kot asam pedas the belt is very indian in origin while the songkok cap is a little higher then what is worn now reflecting achenese influence he said
2473929 this is more than oral history this is visual history remarked panellist prof omar farouk bajunid of hiroshima city university
2473930 the history of the straits malay has not ended it is being lived today their history needs to be redefined by the protectors of malay heritage
2473931 he was totally totally innocent and his death was an abosolutely unforgivable murder
2473932 they claim that any risk they took was worth it because the visit will offer them so much hope but now the visit is off and the timorese are once again in the all too familiar position of being defenceless from arbitrary arrest maltreatment or even death
2473933 he was totally relaxed and being silly it was unlike his earlier conversations where he sounded totally freaked out and tensed
2473934 kamal did not die for nothing its intriguing that years after his death he is still remembered in different ways
2473935 i did not know that world leaders were turning a blind eye to such atrocities in east timor i guess that knowledge is the most beneficial thing that came out of kamals death for me but it is too terrible a price to pay for that knowledge
2473936 punishment using a little known 200 year old us law which allowed human rights violators to be tried wherever they were found todd sued for compensatory and punitive damages
2473937 public appearance as she put it when contacted for this article
2473938 it was very painful doing the film i dont want to play the grieving mother anymore she said in turning down our request for an interview
2473939 kamals death changed us we were no longer a bunch of idealists we were suddenly faced with the reality that our friend whom we considered a family member died in the cause of his activism it made our struggles more real and we became more committed to the cause
2473940 months after he was buried there were still notes flowers letters on his grave says ahmed who visits his sons grave in bukit kiara kuala lumpur regularly to offer prayers
2473941 i was told by the gatekeeper that even now someone would come sit for an hour and then another couple would come sit and weep together people remember him
2473942 retracing kamals travels in indonesia a few years after he was killed wong recalls that villagers whom kamal met along the way still remembered him
2473943 when i told them that kamal had been killed they wept openly
2473944 kamal did what he did not because of religious affiliations or regional politics or for any kind of fame
2473945 it was something very simple very basic he loved people and their suffering tormented him he did what he could for a forgotten people
2473946 thats why teens tend to exhibit risk taking when you make the level super physiologic theres a wide range but in general theres an increase in aggressiveness
2473947 if he was on and off the substances that would be the worst possible scenario for contributing to aggressive and irrational behavior
2473948 there are people who commit very violent acts because of broken marriages after losing their jobs where steroids arent involved at all
2473949 had severe emotional issues and could have had a tipping point event
2473950 im not ruling steroids out but for experts just to say it played a role i wouldnt be so bold
2473951 we all have the tendency to behave irrationally and seek vengeance for things that are done to us but most of us are able to restrain our emotions when we think about the consequences
2473952 but someone who had this testosterone excess sometimes cant restrain himself as well and so thats the kind of way i would look at it it makes their breaking point a little lower
2473953 utter bull the x86 is just a part of the history of computing
2473954 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2473955 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2473956 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2473957 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2473958 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2473959 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2473960 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2473961 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2474060 it is a great suffering for the church in the united states and for the church in general and for me personally that this could happen
2474061 as i read the histories of those victims it is difficult for me to understand how it was possible that priests betrayed in this way their mission was to give healing to give the love of god to these children we are deeply ashamed and we will do what is possible that this cannot happen in the future

2474066 the back of the world the troubling genius of g k chesterton
2474067 in these books his later catholic non fiction works chesterton becomes a pangloss of the parish anything roman is right it is hard to credit that even a convinced catholic can feel equally strongly about st franciss intuitive mysticism and st thomass pedantic religiosity as chesterton seems to his writing suffers from conversion sickness converts tend to see the faith they were raised in as an exasperatingly makeshift and jury rigged system anglican converts to catholicism are relieved not to have to defend henry viiis divorces jewish converts to christianity are relieved to get out from under the weight of all those strange levitical laws on animal hooves the newly adopted faith they imagine is a shining perfectly balanced system an intricately worked clock where the cosmos turns to tell the time and the cuckoo comes out singing every sunday an outsider sees the church as a dreamy compound of incense and impossibility and overglamorizing its pretensions underrates its adaptability a frenchman or an italian even a devout one can see the catholic church as a normally bureaucratic human institution the way patriotic americans see the post office recognizing the frailty and even the occasional psychosis of its employees without doubting its necessity or its ability to deliver the message chesterton writing about the church is like someone who has just made his first trip to the post office look it delivers letters for the tiny price of a stamp you write an address on a label and they will send it anywhere literally anywhere you like across a continent and an ocean in any weather the fact that the post office attracts timeservers or has produced an occasional gun massacre is only proof of the mystical enthusiasm that the post alone provides glorifying the postman beyond what the postman can bear is what you do only if youre new to mail
2474068 may the holy spirit sanctify these offerings let them become the body and blood of jesus christ our lord
2474069 by your holy spirit gather all who share this one bread and one cup into the one body of christ
2474070 grant that we who are nourished by his body and blood may be filled with his holy spirit and become one body one spirit in christ

2474100 i would answer back hard what do you mean hes not one of us its john mccain who wears 500 shoes has six houses and comes from one of the richest families in his state
2474101 its barack obama who climbed up the hard way and thats why he wants middle class tax cuts and better schools for our kids
2474102 im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
2474103 but then that wrinkly white haired man used me in his campaign ad so i guess im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
2474104 im paris hilton and i approve this message cause i think its totally hot
2474105 hes the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was sin and beer was served in a bucket but is he ready to lead
2474106 oh and by the way america i am like totally ready to lead
2474107 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama

2474110 many great intelligent talented academy winning actors standing by awaiting a major press conference to show their support
2474111 i love the art of hip hop i dont always love the message of hip hop
2474112 there are times where even with the artists i love you know theres a message that is not only sometimes degrading to women not only uses the n word a little too frequently but also something im really concerned about its always talking about material things
2474113 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2474114 higher taxes and more foreign oil thats the real obama
2474115 the reality is senator obama is a celebrity the likes of which we havent seen in the political arena certainly in my lifetime so i think you must start in every discussion by acknowledging reality and by pointing out that in this election you cant just inspire people with your words or your crowds or your images or your photos but you must inspire them with your deeds and with your vision and so thats the gap that we see opening up and that were pretty excited and motivated by
2474116 barack obama is the biggest celebrity in the world comparable to tom cruise britney spears and paris hilton
2474117 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day demand

2474119 get off your ass black people its time to get out and vote
2474120 paint the white house black and im sure thats got them terrified mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed
2474121 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
2474122 this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
2474123 wait maybe nas isnt just telling us about a time he gunned down a dude and fucked some whores maybe hes trying to tell us something

2474141 the chinese government is seeking to cover up its ugly occupation of tibet with the bright lights of the olympics our action at tiananmen square today highlights the determination of tibetans and people of conscience that no amount of repression from the chinese government will extinguish the desire of tibetans for freedom and to speak out against chinas worsening abuses in tibet

2474143 your style of teaching although teaching seems an inadequate word to use is inspirational you make it seem so effortless enjoyable and simply mind blowing
2474144 i have found that giving the client the responsibility for knowing what success would mean to them and how they will evaluate that can be a great deal more powerful than offering any kind of set evaluation approach how will they know that their investment in coaching was a good one and how should the coaching programme be set up to best meet these requirements the other vital piece of questioning around evaluation is about sustainability because that often challenges the organisation to shift as well as the few people going through the coaching programme coaching is a great way to waste money if the organisation is not prepared to put in place the changes that would support an roi it may well sound like a cop out in terms of rigorous roi measurement but asking for a strong set of desired outcomes and how the client will recognise those can i believe be a powerful and cost effective way of evaluating coaching

2474170 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2474171 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2474172 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2474173 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2474174 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2474175 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2474176 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2474201 the characters in the story were cute and the illustrations were attractive and appealing to my children having the plush to go along with the book made it more fun for the children the story taught a lesson about fear and loneliness something everyone experiences at one time or another

2474219 obviously once you play for england you want to keep on playing for england ive had a taste of it and i really enjoyed it
2474220 it would be good to get back there but the first thing on my mind is trying to get into the aston villa team ill take it one step at a time
2474221 i think its important for any club to have an english base and there are some quality english players and there are lots of good young english players here at villa so im sure i am in the right place to be noticed by fabio capello

2474230 but the only other option was to have the surgery or stop playing for 10 weeks
2474231 i had to keep going back to spain and for five or six months and i dont think i trained for a week completely
2474232 it all affected by fitness and my confidence levels i played a lot of games we did a comparison with other players who had suffered my injury and they didnt play 20 of the amount of games i ended up playing in
2474233 it just makes all the more determined to do well this season id never had surgery before in my life i dont want to have that any more now im really hungry now to have my best season at everton
2474234 ive been doing even more work than the others because of the rehab im maybe a couple of weeks ahead of schedule so things are going well
2474235 obviously i dont feel 100 yet but to be where i am a week before the season im happy with that i feel as though ill be okay for the start of the season
2474236 we can only ask the fans to be patient were worried because were low on numbers and weve lost key players like alan stubbs manuel fernandes and cars lee carsley
2474237 the manager and the chairman want very specific players and its been hard for them to get them the fans just have to be patient because if we get the right players then it will be worth the wait
2474238 my challenge this season is not only to stay fit but to make my way into the team again
2474239 thats going to be difficult because of the way wes performed and also owen hargreaves and john oshea in the right back position
2474240 the competition for places throughout the team is fantastic but i have never been afraid of a challenge and i dont see it as a pressure or a burden it is exciting and a fantastic incentive

2474279 kalau saya memilih shalat jumat itu namanya mau masuk surga tidak ngajak ngajak
2474280 dan lagi belum tentu tuhan memasukkan ke surga orang yang memperlakukan sembahyang sebagai credit point pribadi
2474281 kira kira tuhan suka yang mana dari tiga orang ini pertama orang yang shalat lima waktu membaca al quran membangun masjid tapi korupsi uang negara kedua orang yang tiap hari berdakwah shalat hapal al quran menganjurkan hidup sederhana tapi dia sendiri kaya raya pelit dan mengobarkan semangat permusuhan ketiga orang yang tidak shalat tidak membaca al quran tapi suka beramal tidak korupsi dan penuh kasih sayang

2474292 we feel bretts weekday evening work experiences may be useful in planning monday night services thanksgiving afternoon services would also be an option
2474293 brett has performed in front of 60 000 live souls a week for 16 20 weeks a year during the last 16 years
2474294 why victoria of course she is quite the offensive player and she has an amazingly powerful right arm shes willing to go to new york to quarterback the jets if brett can be convinced to co pastor lakewood in her place besides our private airline allows her to travel without fear of confrontation
2474295 we believe we can help brett by sharing the osteen secrets of filling stadiums on a more regular year round basis not just on occasional days during the fall and winter months we want to turn brett into the ultimate stadium packer

2474423 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2474424 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2474425 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2474426 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2474435 in our first race we didnt do so well all of a sudden new wind shifts would come but in our second race we improved
2474436 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2474437 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2474453 we must also recognise that the established lefts goals and those of naxalites were the same but the latter adopt a different method to achieve it
2474454 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2474512 anni fa immaginavo il vocativo come ponte per il possibile 5 ero suggestionato dalla mistica e da zanzotto dallomonima raccolta del 1957 pi dal suo titolo che dai contenuti ora mi sembra di poter dire che il vocativo non basta una chiave della poesia al futuro ma non la completa non bastano le invocazioni occorre uno sforzo pi severo e sistematico qualcosa che dovremmo reimparare dalla prosa e tradurre in versi se ne avessi le forze ad esempio proverei a immaginare cosa diverranno le nostre societ multietniche e inaridite forse il focolaio di nuovi e terribili combattimenti fra il buio e la luce che ognuno rivendica

2474559 the learned among the nazarenes expound it of the man who was crucified in jerusalem at the end of the second temple and who according to them was the son of god and took flesh in the virgins womb as is stated in their writings jonathan be uzziel interprets it in the targum of the future messiah and this is also the opinion of our learned men in the majority of their midrashim
2474560 our rabbis with one voice accept and affirm the opinion that the prophet is speaking of the king messiah and we shall ourselves also adhere to the same view
2474561 the meaning of he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities is that since the messiah bears our iniquities which produce the effect of his being bruised it follows that whoso will not admit that the messiah thus suffers for our iniquities must endure and suffer for them himself

2474646 just a continuation of the growing nature of steaming media
2474647 weve been policing this with the march madness spikes you get in the states but obviously this is on a grander scale its happening over a longer time scale during the work week and its the first time theres been this type of capability so were in uncharted areas to some degree
2474648 its hard to give you fixed numbers but in some past cases streaming media has drained significant amounts of bandwidth people might access and leave on an olympics feed that will churn a ton of bandwidth its not just the productivity drain its the bandwidth drain as well there are a lot more web based apps these days and that reduces the ability and performance of other employees using those applications
2474649 there is a productivity angle to this as well as a bandwidth consumption concern the way weve addressed it is by providing granular policy capabilities that enable people to watch some of it without being draconian and closing it out completely which we can also do
2474650 one is for olympic news but not streaming media and then the other is specific to those sites offering streaming media of the games themselves say the nbc site or any derivative site with media signature patterns
2474651 not just nbcs site but any derivative site with media signature patterns that show it links to the parent site its up to the customer whether or not to block it
2474652 were completely non invasive first off its very common for enterprises to have multiple layers of security at endpoints gateways and internet filtering for monitoring user behavior ours is a complementary security technology with a very high attach rate
2474653 because of our architecture its a pass by appliance device we arent in the direct line of fire trying to access a prohibited site results in a blocked page so we dont slow down network traffic at all or any other network appliances trying to do other security
2474654 enterprises tend to be less draconian they do more monitoring and see through reporting
2474655 enterprises will block adult content and any malware categories phishing botnet sites
2474656 we use a set of automated tools as well as human verifiers to assess and classify malware sites properly
2474657 weve done a lot of research with customers on social networking sites and enterprises tend to block social networking sites outright at least most enterprises do that may change going forward they may block it now but going forward may start to consider it as something they have to provide to employees but ration access typically arent blocked outright so the olympics coverage is a new wrinkle it may result in new policies being created as a result my guess is that they going to block it entirely or limit it and i think theyll opt for the latter one other option is that they may just issue a policy to employees letting them know theyre monitoring it thats very common in enterprises

2474665 most importantly business users can obtain enterprise level support from sun but not just sun for either staroffice or openoffice
2474666 the business of supporting openoffice org and for that matter staroffice is in fact growing astonishingly fast around the world the mac element is pivotal too even in areas where you see few macs such as in india though that may be changing too
2474667 but the mac presence grants cios and others tasked with choosing the right software for their organizations the assurance and confidence that they can adopt the opendocument format our native format and the only published iso standard file format for office documents and have an office array that includes macs linux solaris windows and so on
2474668 in short openoffice org and the mac version in particular suture the wounds inflicted by 20 years of divergence the connecting thread is the file format and the understanding that what counts is creating communicating preserving files in a format that resists the fragility of monopoly and the reliance on any one company in fact there is a plugin that gives users the ability to read write odf and with open office 3 0 and staroffice 9 0 well have native support of ooxml which ms office 2007 uses
2474669 staroffice is pitched more to those who want the indemnification against suit by microsoft governments oems and to those who want the ease of having at one go the application plus the most useful extensions
2474670 its also more for those who wish to buy again at the outset the support services training that sun sells
2474671 but support services training are also available for openoffice org and many prefer it over staroffice because it may be in a language that staroffice is so far missing or because an officiating body has insisted that the license of the application be open staroffice is built with open source software same code as openoffice org but the license of the actual application is closed to make modifications one can easily download the corresponding openoffice org code and work with the community

2474693 china is seriously concerned about the worsening situation and armed conflict in south ossetia
2474694 we call on the relevant parties to keep restraint and cease fire immediately
2474695 we sincerely expect the parties concerned to settle the dispute through dialogue and safeguard the regional peace and stability
2474696 putin was satisfied with bushs statement that no one wants a war
2474697 it think we can say that spain is going through something of a golden age in sport at the moment
2474698 we won euro 2008 rafael nadal is the number one tennis player in the world and we have got nba basketball players like pau gasol and jose calderon
2474699 i think sport in spain is very much up there at the top we are seeing a very good generation of athletes coming through and we are also doing that because of government support for sport in general
2474700 the athletes themselves have been working very hard they sacrificed a lot
2474701 we are hoping to get a lot more the spanish team is confident of doing well in many sports and this a good start for us
2474702 heaven knows what it was like to watch this if you were one of the people charged with designing the follow up for london in 2012
2474703 this was the choreographed demonstration of might the like of which the olympic games has never seen a rebuke to george bush and nicolas sarkozy vocal critics of chinese foreign and domestic policy sitting in the audience
2474704 vladimir putin his focus shifted by the military offensive in georgia was a study of quiet admiration for the global confidence his neighbour radiated
2474705 gathering suspicion that beijing 2008 is shaping up to be one of the most political games in modern olympic history
2474706 we plant trees we sow seeds the land turns green
2474707 the good weather and the drop in violence made me get out of the house to enjoy this beautiful garden
2474708 and with the electricity always being cut off at home we decided to come here and enjoy a nice picnic under the shade of the trees
2474709 she has been asked not to give any proactive interview or write anything which hurts the sentiments of people of the country
2474710 she is a guest of our nation and we will treat her as one
2474711 wij schrijven in op basis van de wet conflictrechten huwelijk die polygame huwelijken worden gewoon erkend voor ons is van belang of de documenten authentiek zijn n of de echtgenoot geen nederlander is al dan niet met dubbele nationaliteit ook dan mag het niet
2474712 classic feminist trope for how our sexist society destroys girls innate abilities
2474713 negotiations collapsed the two international companies were adamant that the cost of landing must be between us 0 70 and us 0 90 a litre if they were to make profit but government was adamant that it should be us 0 60
2474714 an employer cannot by contract restrain a former employee from engaging in his or her profession trade or business
2474715 advances the strong california policy favoring open competition and employee freedom
2474716 those have been drivers of the states economy especially in the technology area
2474717 t he beast which they are all frightened off is not a creature lurking in the jungle but a primordial evil buried in everyones sub conscious
2474718 to be honest i didnt even have to invite him to come back he told me recently at hockenheim that he wished to race again because loved the town and the relaxed atmosphere he found here
2474719 it was almost set for to attend the race in 2007 but a last minute commitment prevented him from coming he watched the international challenge on tv and knows what the race is about now im confident that he will be able to take part for the first time
2474720 i met him at indianapolis some years ago and then we raced together at the champions race in paris he seemed to be a nice guy and said that always wanted to visit my country this is his chance and i think he will not miss it
2474721 ten million is a pretty good installed base to write applications for
2474722 every one of those phones could end up with the version 2 0 software its a free upgrade and that will put the app store on every iphone thats out there so its a pretty attractive market to developers
2474723 when youre writing applications you get access to a broader installed base
2474724 and when youre writing for iphone youre hitting up a real set of devices it doesnt extend just to the iphone it extends to the ipod touch which is increasingly becoming a little computer
2474725 apple is opening up the iphone market with a well thought through business model for how the application developer can develop an application and bring it to market and get paid for it
2474726 currently iphones do not have the ability to open a word document
2474727 i would expect someone like dataviz to be all over that
2474728 create slick and responsive applications by hiding latency issues through controlled caching of data and storage of information between sessions
2474729 with google gears for mobile you can do some very smart caching
2474730 you can store data and fetch data ahead of time you can also store that data between sessions so that if you download some photos onto your device one day you come back to it the next day and you dont have to re fetch those photos theyre still there stored there
2474731 there are many business cases and opportunities that can be introduced
2474732 when someone calls my home phone and leaves a message i see it on my windows mobile device
2474733 this is a basic way of unifying your communications by centralizing your voice mail
2474734 we understand some people arent ready to accept unified communications or believe they need it to start so this is a way to start them off by using unified communications to centralize their voice mail and ultimately if they think they need find me follow me or call recording or click to call then they would upgrade from the free service to an account with us
2474735 the major point is that the national bid has been trumped by bids on individual regional licenses
2474736 that means open access wont necessarily be national if the regional licenses are picked up by multiple different players a customer of one of those carriers wouldnt necessarily be able to have open access on a nationwide basis
2474737 although the build out requirement is higher than the fcc has done in past auctions even if the requirements are met were still falling short of ubiquitous broadband coverage over a long time frame
2474738 the rules aim to limit that kind of activity but they dont preclude it
2474739 the fact that people are paying a high premium for the spectrum means that inevitably theres going to be high pricing associated with services that would come about once these networks are built
2474740 the economics associated with this spectrum band will impose a cost structure and operators will have to make decisions about whether the return they want on their investment is over a long or short period of time are they going to cream the market and charge high prices initially for those willing to pay and conserve spectrum or are they going to rapidly build a mass market around a media style model that has rapid adoption curves and a low price of entry were not sure yet it may vary depending on the operator or the type of service they want to introduce
2474741 with those terms the total cost of ownership is horrendous
2474742 nortel has very good core but not that great rf radio frequency and motorola has pretty good rf but not so great core
2474743 motorolas network infrastructure group was for sale for years but nobody wanted it
2474744 we are the comfortable place to gather for coffee tea and sweets
2474745 cheaper phone calls is not exactly what the cellular carriers want
2474746 they ultimately want to grow their arpu average revenue per user
2474747 converged services where you have fixed and mobile services integrated so the home experience is tied to and directly integrated with the remote experience
2474748 my research has indicated that if that was offered it would be extremely popular and people would pay for it
2474749 30 to 40 different operating systems for mobile and that is too many we need to narrow that range to three four or even five
2474750 a lot of times you want to get a voice message but dont want to have a whole conversation
2474751 i would love to have all my voice mail messages work like that

2474780 try it on well just fold and probably apologise as well
2474781 a part of the analysis that led to the war went like this
2474782 we have seen in the last decade the decline of the american government and the weakness of the american soldier who is ready to wage cold wars and unprepared to fight long wars this was proven in beirut when the marines fled after two explosions it also proves they can run in less than 24 hours and this was also repeated in somalia
2474783 the part of the analysis that led to war that i described was not the major one
2474784 1 what historical or scientific or rational evidence did the us have at its disposition to allow it to decide that a democratic regime can
2474785 2 why did the us not use this more positive line of justification for the iraq war in its propaganda
2474786 3 assuming that it is just a lucky coincidence that the us only seems to wage wars against resource wealthy
2474787 4 why does the us think other peoples need it to help them achieve democracy
2474788 1 i did not for a minute believe wmd story
2474789 2 in the war of terror sic this was a largely unneccessary step
2474790 4 us wages war only towards regimes that challenge its power and control in one way or the other
2474791 iran being a more democratic country than all of the american allies combined
2474792 5 us is a soft empire usually unable to stomach long term occupations
2474793 to those that have shall be given from those that have not shall be taken away
2474794 off with the old knee on with the new house
2474795 wars are horrible things that are sometime necessary but are best forgotten
2474796 off with the old knee on with the new house
2474797 off with the old knee on with the new house
2474798 what does shirley need or want for the new house she has started a new collection of lighthouses
2474799 the night before was two days before update two day tickle shirley meme
2474800 off with the old knee on with the new house
2474801 our security is in a bad shape with our intelligence in a defensive mode
2474802 well continue to see more such attacks if something is not done fast
2474803 its what the americans like to call a catch 22
2474804 if we deploy the army then we are monsters but if we dont deploy the army then we are letting the terrorists win
2474805 india lacks a coherent strategic response to terrorism there is no doctrine and most of our responses are kneejerk
2474806 so while india has one of the largest police forces in the world we are still running primitive policing operations
2474807 many states buy a temporary truce with the threatening forces just so they can survive their five year term in office
2474808 what really matters in public perception is the attacks that you fail to avert
2474809 and its not like theyre fighting for something thats not theirs by all international standards
2474810 and its not like theyre fighting for something thats not theirs by all international standards
2474811 no peace with israel no negotiations with israel no recognition with israel
2474812 if youre not happy about something deny it is there
2474813 no peace with israel no negotiations with israel no recognition with israel
2474814 we were part of an arab state and an islamic state
2474815 israels position boils down to just this forget the fact that we keep you caged like animals and treat you constantly with abuse forget the fact that we keep stealing your property in the west bank forget the fact that we hold 9 000 illegal prisoners and practice torture forget our endless assassinations and state terror tactics forget the constant humiliations if you want what israel calls peace you must come to us properly abased humiliate yourself yet again having made every concession we demand in advance
2474816 the arab world is not in a compromising mood its likely mr horowitz that your plan is rational and logical but the fate of nations is not decided by rational logic nations never concede they fight you wont get anything by peaceful means or compromise
2474817 after the signing of the agreements israel refrained from building new settlements although the oslo agreements stipulated no such ban however it continued construction within existing settlements that fell far short of the 1991 92 level the israelis trust in the accords was undermined by the fact according to the israeli government that after the signing of the accords the terrorist attacks against israel did not cease and even intensified
2474818 lookie here the palestinians have had shit thrown at them for decades now am here to end this shit although i accept that shit happens
2474819 he longed for the day when a woman might travel long distances alone
2474820 more serious implications than the information related to venezuela and ecuador
2474821 if anyone can turn this handset division around its sanjay jha
2474822 i think the engineering culture is a tremendous asset to motorola
2474823 i think the challenge is to make that culture stay in tune with the marketplace when its a problem is when it gets disconnected with the marketplace and my job is to keep it connected
2474824 he has strong carrier relationships and he knows the competition
2474825 he understands the wireless industry market and how to implement upcoming developments in hardware
2474826 hes going to have to get some top notch people
2474827 the guys there now are the same guys that have not produced product for several years
2474828 the most important thing they need is a sense of urgency
2474829 he may go to chicago and six months later decide that raising the level of urgency would come by moving at least part of the management team to the west coast
2474830 sanjay has very rigorous operational discipline and he knows the processes here that have been inconsistent
2474831 and i really feel that i can make a difference
2474832 all i can say is that it is not in the thing observed but in the eyes of the observer
2474833 it was probably unexpected of the man it was expected of the nation but not of the man but both rose to the occasion
2474834 mit 21 prozent der stimmen den zweiten platz hinter den usa die politische stabilit t und die starke technologieszene in deutschland gaben hier den ausschlag
2474835 maritime terrorism across national boundaries has gained momentum in the indian ocean armed aggression has increased and multinational cooperation is required to curb it
2474836 an apex body needs to be formed to manage maritime affairs for quick decision making and rapid response currently the fisheries and other resources are under agriculture ministry shipping is under a separate ministry
2474837 we need to have an organisational structure in which representatives of both these ministries sit together along with the indian navy so that we can take action that will be required when there is an emergency situation
2474838 whispered in musharrafs ear that it is time to leave
2474839 over the next few days they will make it clear to him musharraf that a protracted battle against impeachment is not in pakistans interests
2474840 the army is neutral but is expecting him to resign it will then influence his honourable safe passage as the armys senior leadership would not want him to be punished
2474841 concerns about the asian community and the use of pigs raises cultural issues
2474842 during the years when my colleagues and i were labouring to create such commissions we never imagined that they might ultimately be used against freedom of speech

2474857 the phenomenal rise in value follows directly on from the economic rise of china
2474858 there has been a change in the attitude of the government until 2000 government policy was based entirely on economics and politics but now theyve added a cultural element to it added to that you have the emergence of chinese billionaires who want to put contemporary art on their walls
2474859 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2474860 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe

2474866 britney has so many psychological problems that the court gave control of her money and personal life to her dad so someone who honestly cares about her can try to get her back into the real world her pretending to be a lesbian stripper killer is a big mistake
2474867 i know brits dad is trying to gradually get her back into show business and she did okay in the cbs sitcom how i met your mother but prepping your brain so you can act like a crazy killer bitch doesnt fit the profile of someone adjusting gradually into a normal life of course were talking hollywood here and anyone who can stay upright is considered mostly okay
2474868 at heart britney is a lesbian stripper killer whore who likes to sing a little to turn some cash and pay the bills
2474869 this is the kind of film that allows her to be who she is and its going to restart her career and maybe get her an academy award and tarantino his first oscar you cant discount proper casting in a movie britneys dad is okay with it because he knows his own daughter he also figures its way better that she act out her fantasies and get paid for it legitimately than do it in real life and go to prison that was the road she was on hes trying to guide her down this path so she acts the way she wants in the movies and cuts down on it during normal around town days hes damn near a genius you know hes planning to get jamie lynn in knocked up part 2 dont you its another example of perfect casting the guy could run hollywood
2474870 quentin is convinced britney will be brilliant shes delighted she thinks it could turn her career around it is perfect tarantino material he wanted to get britney first shes playing the most important character
2474871 the extension of the conservatorship was at the request and suggestion of britneys doctors theyve indicated shes made great improvement but its a work in progress
2474872 continues to invest unusual and far reaching powers in police authority that does not belong there
2474873 police to act as psychologists in trying to predict and interpret behavior
2474874 people who have guns or act like shouldnt be oppressed by britneys doctors cops or the state of connecticut just because they make some people in the u s uncomfortable
2474875 everyone should be able to do whatever they want in the u s because the country says its free and democratic here in china that doesnt apply because we dont claim to be free or democratic we suppress whomever we want harvest their organs if we feel like it and tell people that the air over the beijing olympic games is clear even when theres smog we define reality our own way here i do like that connecticut gun law you guys got though it fits right in with our own philosophy youll adapt more quickly when we take over than i first thought

2474880 this is the staging post for the georgian military heading towards the front this morning we were talking to and filming a number of very fresh faced looking georgian recruits called up as part of president mikheil saakashvilis full mobilisation of the military on friday they looked relaxed they looked calm
2474881 but all of a sudden the sound of a warplane was heard overhead and a huge explosion not too far away they scattered like flies they didnt know what to do these were not hardened troops by any manner or means
2474882 subsequently there were more explosions around the city cars driving in all directions carrying the injured all sorts of cars military civilian and ambulances
2474883 we are told at this point that the targets of those attacks are military bases outside the city but i am getting reports from witnesses and civilians that villages have also been hit
2474884 russia completely devastated the port of poti on the black sea which is a key port for the transport of energy sources from the caspian sea and is close to the baku supsa pipeline and the supsa oil terminal

2474889 if the anti democratic individual is disposed to see in the outer world impulses which are suppressed in himself
2474890 and we to know what these impulses are then something may be learned by noting what attributes he most readily but unrealistically ascribes to the world around him it seemed that the greater a subjects preoccupation with evil forces in the world as shown by his readiness to think about and to believe in the existence of such phenomena as wild erotic excesses plots and conspiracies and danger from natural catastrophes the stronger would be his own unconscious urges of both sexuality and destructiveness
2474891 homosexuality is a particularly rotten form of delinquency and ought to be severely punished
2474892 no matter how they act on the surface men are interested in women for only one reason
2474893 the sexual orgies of the old greeks and romans are nursery school stuff compared to some of the goings on in this country today even in circles where people might least expect it
2474894 sex crimes such as rape and attacks on children deserve more than mere imprisonment such criminals ought to be publicly whipped
2474895 a strong inclination to punish violators of sex mores homosexuals sex offenders may be an expression of a general punitive attitude based on identification within group authorities
2474896 but it also suggests that the subjects own sexual desires are suppressed and in danger of getting out of hand
2474897 moralistic and punitive attitude toward the supposed sexuality of others
2474898 the authors investigated the role of homsexual arousal in exclusively heterosexual men who admitted negative affect toward homosexual individuals participants consisted of a group of homophobic men n 35 they were assigned to groups on the basis of their scores on the index of homophobia w w hudson and w a ricketts 1980 the men were exposed to sexually explicit erotic stimuli consisting of heterosexual male homosexual and lesbian videotapes only the homophobic men showed an increase in penile erection to male homosexual stimuli homophobia is apparently associated with homosexual arousal that the homophobic individual is either unaware of or denies
2474899 violence anarchic impulses and chaotic destructiveness in the unconscious sphere the pseudo conservative is a man who in the name of upholding traditional american values and institutions and defending them against more or less fictitious dangers consciously or unconsciously aims at their abolition

2474916 it will be hard today we were originally going to do something on the date garry died but that would have been too painful
2474917 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2474918 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2474919 why didnt his mother at least make him comb his hair for this special night
2474920 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2474921 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2474922 such a large influx into the army as is scheduled to occur this fall has not happened before in post soviet russia to their more senior commanders and the media about whether they will be able to cope
2474923 it is not excluded that in order to fulfill draft quotas for the armed forces of the russian federation and other russian forces the military commissariats will begin to draft young people from chechnya
2474924 more healthy and accustomed to the military way of life than are young people from other regions
2474925 today are powerless not only against corruption but also against rise of unbridled illegally as a whole
2474926 are defenseless both before the criminal world and also before greedy bureaucrats and inactive law enforcement officers
2474927 it is thus no surprise that many russian citizens having lost confidence in and thus turned aside from formal laws are paying attention to their experience of their ancestors this concerns by the way not only muslims
2474928 and even the norms of behavior of the times of pagan rus
2474929 there is nothing surprising at all in the turning of residents of muslim regions the shariat
2474930 in the post soviet period during the process of the struggle with radical islam wahhabism traditional islam as embodied in the official structures has become so politicized that this can lead to the total islamization of the republic in the near term
2474931 are ever more insistently penetrating the political and economic structures of north caucasus society
2474932 certain ministers and serious entrepreneurs are themselves murids adepts of the sheikhs
2474933 i did that so long time ago it feels as though it were done by a different person
2474934 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation
2474935 if we all worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true is really true there would be little hope of advance
2474936 off as that way you dont have the expansion contraction problems caused at switchon switchoff
2474937 if we all worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true is really true there would be little hope of advance
2474938 vacumatic dispenser has a bottle which is attached to the engine frame is filled with

2474940 if we all worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true is really true there would be little hope of advance
2474941 my philosophy with writing an actual poem and my poetry career is one of persistence
2474942 when im writing a poem i actually see each stanza as a hurdle almost like in a running race where you have hurdles ill just sit there until i hurdle the next stanza theres often a great sense of relief when ive filled up an a4 page getting from page one to page two if there is a page two i consider a sort of breakthrough when i get stuck in a poem i sit there try to be calm open and non anxious until i have that breakthrough im not shy about risking words on a page ive got to try out a lot of words thats why i dont worry how many pages how many sheets of paper i put in the waste paper basket because im just risking words often i need to write a lot of rubbish to get to the good stuff
2474943 and despite whatever agenda rowan has i would hope the global south primates force a vote on recognizing a new anglican provimce in

2474959 hmm there must be a better way to do this
2474960 so long as the people do not care to exercise their freedom those who wish to tyrannize will do so for tyrants are active and ardent and will devote themselves in the name of any number of gods religious and otherwise to put shackles upon sleeping men
2474961 it is high time for me to put an end to your sitting in this place which you have dishonored by your contempt of all virtue and defiled by your practice of every vice ye are a factious crew and enemies to all good government ye are a pack of mercenary wretches and would like esau sell your country for a mess of pottage and like judas betray your god for a few pieces of money
2474962 never never never believe any war will be smooth and easy or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter the statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events

2474967 audio panton cogito singularis listen to everything think for yourself
2474968 non violent drug offenses are being over prosecuted and corporate crime is being under prosecuted
2474969 the justice department must begin to reverse course crank up the crackdown on corporate crime and end the cruel and inhumane war on non violent drug possession
2474970 the criminal justice system is broken so badly that one hardly knows where to begin describing the breakdown
2474971 lets start with the war on drugs since commentators across the political spectrum recognize its lunacy we pour almost endless resources roughly 50 billion every year into catching trying and incarcerating people who primarily harm themselves this insane war on drugs damages communities and drains crucial resources from the police courts and prisons these resources could be better used to combat serious street and corporate crime that directly violates the publics liberty health safety trust and financial well being as with alcoholics and nicotine addicts the approach to drug addicts should be rehabilitation not incarceration
2474972 the current drug policy has consumed tens of billions of dollars and wrecked countless lives
2474973 the costs of this policy include the increasing breakdown of families and neighborhoods endangerment of children widespread violation of civil liberties escalating rates of incarceration political corruption and the imposition of united states policy abroad in practice the drug war disproportionately targets people of color and people who are poverty stricken coercive measures have not reduced drug use but they have clogged our criminal justice system with non violent offenders it is time to explore alternative approaches and to end this costly war
2474974 probably would not have gone on to have the career you have had
2474975 it is urgent that the u s reverse the incarceration binge the u s department of justice estimates that if incarceration rates remain unchanged an estimated one of every 20 americans and greater than one in four african americans can be expected to serve time in prison during their lifetime
2474976 it is time to make the failed war on drugs a central issue in the american political dialogue for too long we have let this injustice continue to grow unhindered taking action on clemency at the federal level will set an example for the states and begin the process of reversing this failed policy
2474977 the current cruel unjust policy perpetuated and enforced by the bush administration prevents americans who suffer from debilitating illnesses from experiencing the relief of medicinal cannabis
2474978 while substantial scientific and anecdotal evidence exists to validate marijuanas usefulness in treating disease a deluge of rhetoric from washington claims that marijuana has no medicinal value
2474979 in need of alternative crops and aware of the growing market for industrial hemp particularly for bio composite products such as automobile parts farmers in the united states are forced to watch from the sidelines while canadian french and chinese farmers grow the crop and american manufacturers import it from them
2474980 there now is a significant and growing backlog of criminal investigations and unresolved matters

2475001 although asbestos was banned from any new constructions in 2000 it is still present in many buildings built before then
2475002 its a massive concern that people need to be aware of the people most at risk now are tradesman who do small jobs but accidently cut into the fabric of a building and expose the asbestos the danger is that young people dont know what it looks like
2475003 we dont want to scaremonger as long as it is not broken or damaged its safe

2475028 the community health collaboration is a very creative and critically important partnership that will provide significantly improved health care services to many at risk residents in buffalo
2475029 the clinic is very important as it serves a population of buffalo that needs these services a population with an income level that results in less mobility making them in need of something that is close by and reliable
2475030 watson concedes in his preface that i have retained only the empty shell of what i once argued and he suggests moving beyond the new perspective furthermore the insistence on judaism as a religion of grace has had its day and the creativity and diversity of judaism cannot be reduced to any one scheme watson proposes a more nuanced account of what is and is not wrong with the traditional lutheran reading and endeavors to move beyond polarity on the new perspective and paul
2475031 we still dont know whats wrong but yes it is a cancer scare
2475032 jade has undergone a series of tests but the doctors cant pinpoint the problem shes still in pain and its a worry
2475033 the reason i take things so seriously is because i dont necessarily not fancy you
2475034 the only reason i said i didnt fancy you is because on the outside there is someone i like so much i basically said that to cover my tracks

2475049 it was lucky for meg that her owner was well informed because raisins and grapes are potentially lethal for dogs causing acute kidney failure
2475050 the problem is that although we know that raisins are toxic we cannot be certain what quantities need to be consumed to be dangerous
2475051 to be on the safe side afterwards we put her on a drip with a high dose of fluids to flush out her kidneys and minimise any long term damage
2475052 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2475053 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2475054 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2475055 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6

2475063 hes one ive been interested in for some time so im delighted hes signed
2475064 he excelled in a very successful colchester side last year and he was a firm favourite at cardiff before the arrival of dave jones
2475065 there were four or five other clubs in this division pursuing him so its quite a coup for us
2475066 i had no future with cardiff and i wanted to sort things out before my flight this morning now i can relax
2475067 im happy things are sorted i enjoyed my time at cardiff but the writing was on the wall that i didnt figure in the managers plans

2475084 she lost quite a bit of weight and a lot of it was muscle mass as the result for being in a coma for so long
2475085 there was one day when her fever got up to 106 they had cooling blankets on the bottom of her on the top and they were very very concerned
2475086 there was a period of 24 hours where her temperature remained at 105 2
2475087 the reason for the paralysis is that when the body is running a fever like that you automatically start to shiver and you produce more core heat

2475094 when she was diagnosed 10 years ago with type 1 diabetes like any other parents we asked why
2475095 we never got the answer as to why it happened to her
2475096 now we look back and we say diabetes saved our daughters life this was just the path that was chosen for us
2475097 shed be at 400 one minute and then shed drop to a 33 when you get down that low you start talking about convulsions and coma

2475100 i am sorry to announce that we are out of eggrolls fortune cookies and the sweet and sour chicken
2475101 no jesus is the fully authoritative interpreter of the torah
2475102 for over 200 years critical historical study of the bible has put everything in question that one finds in the bible about jesus
2475103 l demann is right to observe that benedicts work suffers from many historical flaws
2475104 no convincing arguments against the scholarly consensus that the johannine discourses have nothing to do with what jesus himself actually said
2475105 t he jesus of the fourth gospel and the jesus of the synoptics is one and the same the true historical jesus
2475106 if benedict is right it puts us exegetes out of business
2475107 the falsifying consignment of the biblical message to uncritically adopted greek philosophy

2475216 where a singer works to be hot and then people like her because she is hot and so she sings songs that show off how hot she is rather than songs that posses any real meaning and the girls who watch her think that being hot is the goal until being asked to pose naked on the internet is an accomplishment rather than an insult

2475228 when i was writing it i could see the front cover of the first issue of asbo lutely and it seemed like a good idea worth waking up for but in the morning the question youre left with is why would people on an asbo who presumably have pretty severe behavioural problems want to know about lutes its a great name for a magazine but i reckon thats just too niche a market to launch a magazine for
2475229 i thought it sounded like a wicked idea at first an ingenious pun on the word trump such a good word to start with you could have a deck of cars with pictures of people with the surname trump and give them scores for their various attributes but then i realised i could only think of two donald and ivana so itd be a pretty short game golf handicap 4 pairs of stilettos 14 000 i wondered about including characters from trumpton particularly the mayor but i figured that was stretching an already tenuous gag if anyone can think of another 50 people called trump theyre welcome to the idea

2475233 i havent completely given up on this idea but i did want to share it drunk as i may have been i obviously took some time over this the little squiggles are meant to indicate flashing neon lights by the way imagine if you will that noted crime fighter and felon foiler grisholm took a sabbatical and johnny vegas got the job as top dog at the csi office now theres a dramatic opportunity or is there monkey dont blind me wscience jus gis another pie vegas drinks guinness ill take you all on bastards if anyone wants to buy an option on this let me know

2475326 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian disaster is gathering pace
2475327 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd
2475328 but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack
2475329 told us that they had no active weapons of mass destruction program
2475330 the going in assumption was that we were going to war so this nie was to be written with that in mind
2475331 reported that production of chemical and biological weapons was taking place
2475332 gave those of us at the most senior level further confidence that our information about saddams wmd programs was correct
2475333 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months
2475334 iran wants no war with any country and today iran is a friend of the united states and even israel
2475335 it is apparent that iran has not yet perfected uranium enrichment and as a direct result of u n sanctions irans ability to procure technology or items of significance to its missile programs is being impaired

2475358 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2475359 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers

2475371 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
2475372 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2475373 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2475374 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2475375 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2475376 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2475377 i should have known that people would feel that way
2475378 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2475379 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2475380 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go

2475382 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2475383 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2475384 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2475385 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2475386 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2475387 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career

2475419 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2475420 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2475421 a month after i was born in a small town more like a village of nueva segovia that used to be called chocoyos and today is metapa
2475422 i got my artist tay dizm and ive already got his single beam me up featuring me and rick ross ive also got young cash coming out right now jay lyriq ive got a lot of stuff coming on my nappy boy label
2475423 i just worked on ciaras album me and kanye did it again we did another hook like two days ago
2475424 i got two records with t pain that are retarded
2475425 if you wouldve come to my wedding you would have heard the records at my reception everybody was going crazy its this one record we got thats called talk that its phenomenal everybody is like you rapping like that i been doing that its nothing for me
2475426 that record i wont put on my lp cause its so much of a smash
2475427 its so phenomenal you would be like well why wouldnt you put it on your record if its so much of a smash because i would give it to my sister my sister needs that record more than i would need that my sister which is missy if missy had that record shes gone shes gone
2475428 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2475429 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2475430 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2475431 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2475432 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2475433 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2475434 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2475435 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2475436 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2475437 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
2475438 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
2475439 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live
2475440 i called him to my room and we sat down
2475441 its the long walk you can hear his footsteps coming down the hallway and youre thinking how am i going to drop this bomb on him
2475442 i immediately got to the punch line i didnt try to make him feel like it was going to be good news i told him ive got bad news for you ive always felt if its bad lets get it out of the way and lets deal with it after that he handled it like he handles everything he was classy but he was disappointed
2475443 i knew that we sent them a lot of comprehensive information
2475444 and they had bens statement so based on my conversations i felt like they had the information they needed to make a decision
2475445 because me and ben were real close i just feel so bad for him im upset im really upset about it its a bummer for the whole team but weve got to have the mentality that weve got to keep on pushing weve got to use this anger that we have and turn it into focus and hard work
2475446 he had one game where he played last year and he was the big east player of the week
2475447 so ive got to feel confident in that sense that at least weve got somebody whos got experience well give him the opportunity and see where he goes with it
2475448 ben we didnt have enough time together it would have been nice to have a second year
2475449 listen guys we all have to overcome adversity and today ben mauks going to have to overcome the fact that he is no longer going to play college football the ncaa has decided that they were not going to grant his extension request its next man in
2475450 this was the first time we went live on a short field
2475451 the defense was very successful getting stops on the first six plays we saw some very good things on that side of the ball we need to work on some execution things on the offensive side but it overall was a good morning im hoping we can bounce back with a high energy workout this afternoon
2475452 knowing who im dating and what kind of cereal i eat aint gonna benefit anybody else that kind of thing is not important
2475453 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private
2475454 im never gonna go double plat but im okay with that

2475459 they were at the drum tower they were stabbed in the attack and shortly after the attack the assailant took his own life thats really the extent of what i know about the attack itself
2475460 my understanding is that the individuals who were attacked were not wearing apparel that obviously or automatically identified them as members of the united states delegation or in any way connected them to the united states delegation

2475462 a guy came in here to buy a fishhook and you sold him a boat and a truck
2475463 i feel like i am getting there with the superbike as this really is the first time i have ridden one problem
2475464 the bike i was riding at the start of the season was a superstock machine and the superbike is a completely different beast
2475465 in that first session when stuart easton came back in nick morgan just said jump on i really was thrown in at the deep end i found my feet though almost straight away and as the sessions went on i improved about two seconds in the dry conditions
2475466 a pole is always nice and achieving a small record makes it of course even sweeter
2475467 personally i dont care too much about this i always want to be as far in front as possible weve done that the car was good i made a small mistake on my quickest lap it would have probably been possible to be one or two tenths faster
2475468 but nevertheless i am happy and satisfied we even do not have to do much more for the race because we already have a good race set up too

2475470 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2475471 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2475472 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2475473 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2475474 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2475475 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2475480 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2475481 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2475489 beijing has been turned into the worlds largest potemkin village
2475490 the streets of beijing are quiet but it is the quiet of the graveyard not only has the chinese government broken its promises to improve its human rights record the games themselves have led this oppressive regime to crack down on dissent on a scale unprecedented since the brutal cultural revolution
2475491 china is one of the worst violators of human rights in the world
2475492 giving the chinese communist party bragging rights over the games makes a mockery of their meaning
2475493 another report has surfaced predicting a delay in the introduction of handsets with googles android software
2475494 the killing of martin roxas just three days after the wounding of dennis cuesta in general santos city highlights the continued threats against journalists and the problem of impunity that has allowed the killers of journalists to go scot free
2475495 the philippine authorities must fulfill their responsibility to protect each and every person from such violence the fact that journalists continue to be targeted is a clear indication that the authorities actions or lack of actions are not delivering the message of zero tolerance
2475496 the brazen daytime attacks merely show that the culture of impunity the government has helped nurture by its inaction apathy and even its outright attempts to stifle press freedom continues to thrive
2475497 urges the philippine government to send a strong signal of its determination to protect the media by assigning additional resources to the task force in charge of investigating attacks on journalists
2475498 government projects or any other voluntary dealings entered into by the government and private individuals corporate entities or institutions
2475499 he would arrive at the factory sometimes as early as 4 00 a m extremely drunk his car would be parked right at the factorys gate so that when it was time for us to enter and punch in at 6 00 am we would have to line up to kiss mr ong
2475500 every woman who had to report for work early in the morning had no choice but to kiss mr ong youre considered lucky if you had to report at 10 a m when mr ong would most likely be at his office or asleep
2475501 i immediately refused the promotion i refused outright and told mr ong i would not be shamed in front of my co workers and my husband who was also in the same department he retorted i should kiss him when my husband is not around it was embarrassing
2475502 we didnt like it nobody liked it but we had no choice we all feared we would lose our jobs
2475503 he was drunk and put operations to a halt at 10 00 am we then decided to go home and as i punched out my time card he shouted and asked that i approach him at first he said he wanted to know if i was the one responsible for trying to organize a union in the factory i denied this and asked if i can leave he ignored my request and said it was good that i wasnt starting a union at that point he pulled his zipper down and grabbed my hand he asked if i would touch him as he tried to bring my hand closer to his private part i was able to pull away and ran toward my co workers outside i was shocked and shivering
2475504 for over a decade it was tolerated and even encouraged by the management we had no union and we didnt know where to turn to not one sexual harassment case was filed against mr ong
2475505 as contractualization and unemployment worsen women find it more and more difficult to find their voices inside the workplace they risk losing their jobs unfortunately the existing law against sexual harassment has failed to curb the commission of the crime in workplaces
2475506 it has been more than ten years now we believe it is time for amendments to be introduced
2475507 the employer head of office in a work related education or training environment or institution shall hereby be mandated to adopt a comprehensive detailed written policy on sexual harassment and so that there shall be a 48 hour deadline within which to act on complaints against sexual harassment in these places
2475508 crisis begets violence women become all the more vulnerable to gender violence sexual abuse and harassment in the midst of poverty women workers would have no other choice than to endure these sexual advances rather than face joblessness in the workplace violence against women becomes all the more prevalent in the absence of a womens committee or worse in the absence of a union
2475509 it is not just the sexual harassment that goes unabated when workers are without a union
2475510 we know that organizing ourselves into a union would give us leverage we have had several attempts in the past ten years but the management always found a way to stop us
2475511 the stoppage of operations and bringing out of the machines are illegal attempts of the management to establish a runaway shop we picketed the gate and blocked the passageway to keep the trucks and the machinery from leaving
2475512 life is very hard we need more income and so i want my children to look for work
2475513 kung naniwala pa sana sa akin ang tatay mo di siya mamamatay
2475514 the impact of food inflation on urban poverty and its monetary cost some back of the envelope calculations
2475515 the relationship between international and domestic food prices is country specific the transmission of high world prices to domestic prices depends on the depth of international markets for different commodities countries exchange rates variations against the us dollar during the period the degree of openness of the different economies and domestic policies in response to the shock domestic relative food prices are affected by inflation of non food prices which also varies by country
2475516 i will let no one and no ones political plans threaten our nations survival
2475517 mired in poverty have no work and are being punished by high food and oil prices
2475518 seven years after the she made these promises poverty further worsened prices of commodities increased and many lost their jobs
2475519 i think i have now by gods help discharged my obligation in writing this large work let those who think i have said too little or those who think i have said too much forgive me and let those who think i said just enough join me in giving thanks to god
2475520 it is important to bring fes case to the state industrial relations commission because this case is undermining the fundamental rights of an australian worker to at least have the minimum conditions of employment
2475521 i havent personally seen a case like this before but i would say its going on and it needs to be highlighted that fe was prepared to come forward and not as many people would probably be prepared to come forward

2475620 were looking to be one of the top contenders for sure because we have a group of kids here who are all in the same age group coming from the same grade and theyre all friends
2475621 theyve been playing together and hanging out together for the past 10 years basically and phil has been coaching these guys during that time hes really created a good group atmosphere and a good sense of camaraderie
2475622 chris hodges came on board and starting coaching them a couple of years ago and brought them over to england to play
2475623 so these guys have played a lot of soccer in the last couple of years and theyve done it all as a group we think well stack up really well
2475624 coming into these tournaments with 12 and 13 year olds you never know what youre going to get from day to day weve got good pitching and we play really good defence but the hitting comes and goes
2475625 these guys have done well all year and this tournament is a great bonus because they get to play some teams they havent played already
2475626 theres a bit of pressure theres always pressure to compete and do well but the bottom line is and what i love about this age group is win or lose its back to the village for supper and theyll be chasing girls and theyll be in the games room and it doesnt linger too long they dont get too worked up over it
2475627 in terms of what can happen in a round robin tournament you just never know but im expecting the other teams to be competitive
2475628 hopefully well play well and i expect our boys to be there in the hunt for the gold medal
2475629 we had about 25 people try out and we were pleased with that turnout
2475630 we had two days with two two hour sessions a day and we had different drills involving things like serving volleying and groundstrokes as well as some matches and we based our decisions on picking the team on all that
2475631 i dont see a reason why they cant do well
2475632 st johns has a really good tennis pedigree over there all of them are well trained but our players are really quite good so im very optimistic in how theyll do
2475633 where its really new its rough a lot rougher than the courts up by the curling club
2475634 weve practised there and the kids are going to get used to it its not too big of a difference its essentially the same thing just the timing of their strokes is a little different waiting for the ball to get off the bounce
2475635 the biggest factor is that were playing on our home course and the kids are familiar with it
2475636 especially since there is no practice round so some teams might come in here and not have a clue where to hit the ball whereas our kids play this course every day
2475637 its not just that though because weve got a lot of excellent players on our team
2475638 two of our players matthew and michael tibbo just came back from the canadian junior tournament so i think we should do excellent i expect we should get a medal for sure
2475639 i would say st johns north because they have a lot of solid players on that team
2475640 central has also got a pretty good team and i expect them to do really well too

2475652 when you take spirituality out of art what you are left with is the protocol of methodology
2475653 when you take beauty out of worship you have turned your back on the most immediate and useful way in which gods voice has been heard in the world
2475654 up until 70 100 years ago the most beautiful building in the town was the church
2475655 ideology becomes a substitute for beauty which is why so much religious art is trash
2475656 we need to reconnect ourselves with the idea of having beauty as one of our highest goals to insist that it become part of christian dialogue and culture not just worship
2475657 we need to create communities which cultivate our artistic capacities
2475658 we need art because most of us go through life half awake
2475659 as a child art shows you possibilities and awakens who you are who you might be
2475660 the fact that the role of art has been usurped by commercial entertainment is dangerous because it conditions our imaginations and our emotions in ways that are destructive if i take away from you the bread of life i do not take away your hunger but you will satisfy it more cheaply the point of entertainment is to make you feel good about yourself art calls you to something higher

2475665 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders as articulated in numerous un security council resolutions
2475666 calls on all parties to cease hostilities and to resume without delay so as to secure a political solution to the crisis which respects georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2475667 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2475668 there is a report coming from bmw about what happened there but the rumour is they havent a clue why it happened they have no idea and that is a worry
2475669 you only need to think about what would happen if someone gets shocked into the fast lane of the pit lane
2475670 it is like a plane crash when you dont get the evidence
2475671 its flavour of the month but the simple fact is teams will get on top of it
2475672 if you look at the electronic systems they are fairly standard technology which is why people are going for them rather than some of the more involved mechanical type systems that do pose a lot of problems
2475673 the fact is we will get on top of them quickly as soon as one person does the nature of formula one means everyone else has to things like the incident with bmw im sure they are working to understand it but i dont think thatll cause problems it should be straightforward

2475677 i havent been brilliant all day and i didnt expect to be so far ahead
2475678 i got well ahead in the fight but i did feel my legs begin to tire a bit which might just reflect how ive felt all day
2475679 and then i made two major mistakes i felt comfortable in the first score to get turned and then to be countered from that comfortable position i was a bit disappointed
2475680 i dont think it is anything missing from my judo i know when im full speed and not feeling so drained im capable of doing anything

2475682 we wanted to keep them interested in learning so we gave them different themes to explore so they can see what is around
2475683 we also had water days we went for walks on main street and over to the courtsquare
2475684 we are trying to give kids something educational to do during the summer and maybe even give parents a break
2475685 we began a grassroots partnership with conservation organizations wherever they were available
2475686 those associations were responsible for keeping those folks up and running
2475687 we use that money for the fishing derby to setup at the fair to pay insurance and our property tax
2475688 other groups who have smaller budgets than we do will really be hurting
2475689 these conservation groups have done so much for us over the years and we share the same mission
2475690 the grants will assist with projects like this the youth fishing derbies hunter safety and conservation
2475691 the difference is they will have to apply for the money
2475692 the businesses may still operate for the remaining 18 hours a day
2475693 therefore the law is merely a reasonable regulation on the time place and manner in which plaintiffs may exercise their first amendment rights
2475694 the property was initially bought to bring a company in and create jobs
2475695 that hasnt happened and weve since identified more attractive properties and are focusing on those sites
2475696 this does not include land costs utility upgrades furnishings and fixtures
2475697 we feel there is not a significant impact to the historic district if these buildings were to go away
2475698 these arent the most important buildings in ohio by any means but collectively the wright field historic district is very important and these buildings are part of that
2475699 its really just about conveying the breadth of activities that took place at the base that were significant as you lose those buildings you lose the physical reminder of that
2475700 the only way to clean up the contamination which is under the slab of the building is to take the building down and dig out the contamination
2475701 this will allow the land to be available for mission work in the future

2475707 i couldnt believe it i had a headache this morning i felt so terrible that i didnt know how id shoot so to win the first gold medal of this olympics is pretty amazing
2475708 wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2475709 im very happy and i think i did a very good job
2475710 today i have tried my best to compete whether or not this medal was the first gold
2475711 we have to focus on our own performance and this helps me to relax and not come under pressure
2475712 i didnt expect to be number one it was just the luck of the draw

2475721 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
2475722 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states it is fortunate that this incident didnt end in a very ugly gunfight
2475723 law enforcement operations have led from time to time to innocent incursions by both u s and mexican law enforcement personnel and military units into the territory of both nations

2475860 the home office deduction is a critical tax break for small business owners yet the time consuming process of navigating a tangled web of rules and regulations makes it unsurprising that so many taxpayers forgo claiming it
2475861 it is imperative that this congress simplify our tax code which costs taxpayers countless dollars and hours each year the confusion over the home office tax deduction can be readily solved by passing this legislation ensuring that we take a strong step toward making our tax laws easier to understand
2475862 in my 2007 annual report to congress i made a similar proposal to simplify the home office business deduction i am pleased that sen snowe and conrads proposed bill reflects the gist of my legislative recommendation reducing the burdensome substantiation requirements for employees and self employed taxpayers who incur modest home office costs would make the home office business deduction simpler and more accessible to them
2475863 currently only a small percentage of home based businesses in the u s take advantage of the home office deduction because calculating the deduction is unnecessarily complicated nfib small business owners have advocated for a simpler standard home office deduction for years the snowe conrad legislation gives home based businesses the option to deduct a legitimate business expense with minimum hassle this commonsense change to the tax code will reduce tax complexity and help many home based businesses take advantage of this deduction

2475911 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
2475912 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
2475913 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
2475914 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities

2475916 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

2475947 i would be grateful if you could tell me what happens to the recycling collected in worthing we put everything in the same box card cans etc and it all appears to go into the same hole in the recycling van i have been told that if this is the case it would be too labour intensive to sort it at the other end and all the recycling will simply be crushed up and used for roads or dams for example but not to be turned back into usable items i e a bottle becoming another bottle paper recycled into more paper is this correct
2475948 dear katie initially all the recycling is taken to a bulking station in lancing where it is loaded onto bulk transport it is then taken to a sorting plant in crayford south east london where it is separated into constituent parts i have toured the plant myself and can assure you that all the materials streams are separated fully using a combination of hand and mechanical sorting the plant we are using is only a temporary arrangement as a near littlehampton when it is operational it will be geared up for public visits so i would encourage you to take a look for yourself at the appropriate time you wont be disappointed i found my trip to crayford to be extremely interesting and a little mesmerising in terms of final reprocessing the material streams are sent far and wide mixed paper is going to a plant in essex where it is turned into packaging and insulation glass is used in the road building industry to create anti skid surfacing plastic bottles are sent to china where they are used to manufacture clothing and toys steel is sent to south wales where it is fed in with other steel scrap and turned into cars electricity pylons etc aluminium is sent to warrington where it is used to make new drink cans i hope this reassures you that you are making a difference

2475987 we got some information yesterday 29 july that the troops they left behind were leaving but we are still trying to establish how far they have gone from abyei
2475988 in mid july they were still living in temporary shacks or crowded into homes with other families many told hrw they are unwilling to return until the khartoum government fully withdraws its saf sudanese armed forces military forces from the town
2475989 all this time the situation has been very tense people have been talking about the fear that fighting could break out again they were waiting for tensions to calm down before they started going back to abyei
2475990 this was the result of inherent limitations in the unmis mandate lack of sufficient personnel and resources and movement restrictions imposed by both saf and the spla
2475991 displaced civilians said they had lost confidence in the ability of un peacekeepers to provide protection for them
2475992 what i can say is that we believe that the peacekeeping force acted within its mandate and capacity
2475993 as in all cases of this nature there is an internal review that would point towards lessons learned that way we dont repeat what happened
2475994 basically if these arrangements are fully in place and an administration established and we expect that to happen shortly we believe the conditions would be conducive for the return of the idps

2476029 maggots filthy sniveling maggots your rotting corpses are barely worthy of burning for the glory of tzeentch
2476030 you have no idea what you are facing are you fools we norsemen are the greatest warriors the world has seen you southerners build keeps cities and castles to hide in armor yourselves with heavy plate and ring mail hoping to be saved from our fury none of it matters in flesh and mind you are weak pitiful worthy of nothing but our contempt you pray to the memories of an emperor since long rotting in his grave clinging to faint echoes of past glories in the desperate hope that doom will not befall you and your empire but it will our might is eternal and endless born in the harsh cold fostered by the powers of chaos and driven by the will of tzeentch we are unstoppable the war is such that only we the men and women of norsca can win
2476031 soon the piles of skulls shall tower above the spires of altdorf those of you that are spared the honor of being sacrificed shall toil as slaves calling us master and then we shall spread to all the kingdoms of this world and see them tremble and fall to the hordes of chaos our champions shall lead vast armies to the far reaches of the realm all for the glory of the great beast there will be no place were we do not rule and the gods of chaos reigns
2476032 yet you think you have a chance if only you knew what power that giving yourself to chaos yields even among us those yet not committed by all their heart and mind cannot grasp it once you receive the gifts of the changer of great tzeentch anything is yours to take it all becomes so clear so simple you understand that which has been hidden that the world is ever evolving birth and decay growth and corruption life and death they are all intertwined and brought together by chaos giving yourself to the lords of ruin lets you see the pattern and bend it to your needs and there is simply nothing like it
2476033 it fills your mind blanking everything else out wave after wave of tzeentchs force surges through your body the flesh changing and improving in front of your eyes if ever you had any doubts no matter what questions plagued you it does not matter any longer pain will rack your body at first as your bones crack and muscle and cartilage twist and re shape these moments of torments pass quickly though only to leave you drenched in the bliss that chaos fills you with thereafter you long for more of it for mutation corruption and change and you know that by following the wishes of the architect of fate greater gifts will be given to you all that needs to be done is let the breath of tzeentch fully enter your mind to quench the never ending thirst for blood by slaughtering your despicable kind to unleash destruction on you and let your screams of agony be our shouts of victory
2476034 this is our time the changer of ways has chosen his champions and marauders you maggots of the empire shall learn the might of our wrath the war host of tzeentch is on the march and we shall exterminate you like the vermin you are

2476049 we sill soon be looking at re carpeting the runway
2476050 the development agenda of northern kenya in general was set by the colonial administration and the independent government tended to maintain the status quo the colonialists created the closed districts ordinances and confined the pastoralists to specific and limited areas of the dry lands
2476051 we are doing consultations and could name the school after the prince once we get his clearance
2476052 this will cushion the pastoralists from losses incurred when the herds are transported by road to the kenya meat commission plant in athi river
2476053 on arrival the animals appear to have lost a lot of weight which reflects on the pricing
2476054 the president is expected to open the airport towards the end of this month we are only waiting for the head of civil service mr francis muthaura to set the date
2476055 the airport will accommodate bigger aircraft the runway is 2 8km
2476056 we are targeting international airlines from somalia ethiopia sudan whom we hope will make good use of the airport

2476129 diese gruppen publizieren ihre treffs auf einschl gigen internetseiten da gegen ist nichts zu machen au er mit polizeipr senz zu reagieren jede mediale berichterstattung sorgt nur f r mehr aufmerksamkeit
2476130 es gibt nur ein ziel das hei t sich anzusaufen
2476131 wer so argumentiert wei nicht wovon er spricht oder er sagt absichtlich die unwahrheit
2476132 ich habe mit landeshauptmann haider gesprochen und die finanziellen auswirkungen sind ja im g ltigen finanzausgleich paktiert der tr gt auch die unterschrift von landeshauptmann haider
2476133 i am more than pleased with it that was my first 2k since the injury two months ago i was in hospital now i feel there is more to come in this regatta
2476134 every race we are going to step it up a little bit more and a little bit more fingers crossed toes crossed everything crossed that we can have a nice clean run through to the semi finals now
2476135 to go in there put a marker down by winning is really good
2476136 all the opposition will now look at us as a heat winner
2476137 it didnt really go to plan we had a good start and then the chinese moved on us through the middle we didnt respond to that very well
2476138 we are going to work on that tomorrow and hopefully get it right on monday
2476139 i will have to go back and talk to my coach and go back to the drawing board
2476140 i think it was just one of those days everything was going great up until i got in i got in the water and nothing happened i did the first two strokes and it didnt feel right
2476141 it was the hardest race i have ever done everyone was so close
2476142 i was trying to focus on myself and make it to the semis and i did it i hope i can go quicker tomorrow my personal best is 57 78 todays quickest qualifier swam 57 58 so who knows what can happen tomorrow is another day
2476143 he was picked up and put in prison and really badly knocked around
2476144 the old theory was that to run 800m you had to run 100 miles a week my dad took that idea apart
2476145 to run a world class 800m time you run 80 of the race without enough oxygen so he started me on a programme which cut the miles to a third but had me running 40 200m consecutively with a 30 second recovery or six 800metres
2476146 we need to keep improving again that is the way this club is
2476147 whether big names come or go it is about manchester united moving on that will always be the case
2476148 it wasnt bad winning the double but if we dont keep winning the manager will definitely change things
2476149 i am sure he will have a few ideas in mind anyway the deadline is a few weeks away yet so we might have a new face or two
2476150 but people know what a football dressing room is like so we had a few little surprises for him
2476151 it is not just about footballing ability when you are spending such large sums of money you have to get everything right
2476152 it is about the personality and how they fit into the club he wants to be sure they will not upset things more often than not he gets it spot on
2476153 it will be interesting to see if they have a team
2476154 apparently half their players were on the toilet for a week

2476161 a group of 10 armed militants attacked a police checkpost in bunir and shot dead eight police officials deployed there
2476162 these militants came from swat valley to attack the post
2476163 our men attacked the checkpost and shot dead police officials
2476164 we will continue targeting all those police officials who are taking part in the ongoing military operation against us
2476165 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a standdown by all troops
2476166 we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6

2476194 we have been forced to support either of the dravidian parties since 1977 and during the eight electoral experiences that followed
2476195 this is despite having aided the aiadmk victories with sympathy waves in 1985 and 1991 after the assassinations of indira and rajiv gandhi respectively
2476196 what do we gain from a government when we cannot even have the power to get a peon appointed in government service
2476197 we have more than the magic number of 118 the simple majority easily available to us through the backing of 35 mlas belonging to the congress even if one has to eventually subtract the 15 left legislators support in the assembly
2476198 who is there to challenge us but for the bjp whose presence in tamil nadu is a miniscule fraction above zero and the vaiko led mdmk which has six legislators other political parties here arent willing to touch the aiadmk with a bargepole
2476199 we need just 17 cross votes to bring down the dmk government two less than the number that helped manmohan singh win the trust vote on july 22
2476200 we had decided to take part in the all party meet and place our viewpoint before them but the very presence of three major kashmiri leaders soz abdullah and mufti has made us rethink our decision and boycott the meet

2476211 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2476212 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2476213 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2476214 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2476215 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2476216 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2476217 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2476218 under the joint resolution which is intended to bring back normalcy in aleosan paragraph c says that the repositioning of warring forces those who are not local to the area be facilitated in order to preclude repetition of armed clashes and hostile acts that undermine the ceasefire agreement and the peace process
2476219 involved milf commanders in the situation appealed to check on the land conflict issue in aleosan and in many areas of cotabato province they also hit the government for the non signing of the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain moa ad
2476220 the government forces have yet to reposition their troops but it is expected to follow suit with the ongoing gradual repositioning of the milf forces
2476221 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2476222 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2476223 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2476224 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2476225 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2476226 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2476227 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2476228 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2476229 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2476230 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2476231 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2476232 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2476233 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2476234 if youre going to take a week off this is an intelligent time to do it
2476235 if i put in three or four 18 hour 20 hour days in a row im not sharp its just a fact
2476236 it seems to help me to get up a little later in the morning
2476237 we all get caught up in the excitement of it especially us mediocre high school junior varsity athletes
2476238 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2476239 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead
2476240 we believe that quality and affordable health care is a basic right
2476241 we believe that covering all is not just a moral imperative but is necessary to making our health system workable and affordable
2476242 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance
2476243 demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2476244 we will work with canada and mexico to amend the north american free trade agreement so that it works better for all three north american countries
2476245 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2476246 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2476247 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2476248 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2476249 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2476250 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2476251 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2476252 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2476253 like it would have crossed our minds to let up on the guy just because hes on vacation
2476254 it literally is the same old democratic consultant driven politics
2476255 its the same attempt not to tell a story about the country and the other guy but to prove youre right like an academic debating seminar
2476256 i am going to see my grandma who i havent seen in almost 18 19 months and whos getting to the age that i want to make sure i am spending time with her on a consistent basis and so she can see her great grandchildren
2476257 and i want to spend some time with those children as well
2476258 we had a very long primary we had the longest primary in history and so i can imagine folks need a break from politics
2476259 i think that the majority of people had been fed a constant stream of political chatter and i am sure that having a couple of weeks off and enjoying the olympics is probably what the doctor ordered for everybody
2476260 im going to go body surfing at an undisclosed location im going to see my tutu my grandmother im going to watch my girls play on the beach
2476261 its that spirit that im convinced is what america is looking for right now
2476262 ele atingiu o canto de uma casa e foi a rvore que o parou
2476263 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2476264 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

2476268 the basic thing is they want to government entities to work things out
2476269 theyre kind of diving into a sea of legal confusion
2476270 were interested in following the process and trying to reach some sort of accord with them
2476271 we have a certain feeling about how these dealings interrelate and melbourne has a little different feeling on it

2476281 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2476282 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2476283 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2476284 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2476285 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2476286 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2476287 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2476288 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2476289 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2476290 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2476291 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2476292 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2476293 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
2476294 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2476295 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2476296 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2476297 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2476298 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2476299 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2476300 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2476301 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2476302 due to damage from chronic stomach acid they are people who have a higher risk of developing esophagus cancer the goal of this therapy is to literally freeze the damage in its tracks and stop it before it turns to cancer
2476303 this is a disease we see in a lot of older patients with other illnesses so the decision to send them to surgery requires careful consideration cryoablation therapy is particularly attractive for older patients who may have complications or other medical issues such as accompanying heart or lung diseases that make traditional surgeries for barretts with dysplasia too risky
2476304 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2476305 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2476306 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2476307 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2476308 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2476309 obese men are more likely to be diagnosed with an aggressive form of the disease
2476310 our assumption is that these men have more blood volume so psa gets diluted he said
2476311 by the time obese men get to elevated levels the cancer is more advanced
2476312 im not sure that we should check obese men more often
2476313 but we should have a higher psa index of suspicion of what is not normal 3 4 rather than 4 for really obese men 3 2
2476314 the prostate is a narrow thing to operate on and when there is a big wad of fat in your way if the abdominal wall is thick it becomes a technical issue
2476315 the only thing we can think of is that when you operate on obese people you have to be more careful
2476316 we cant forget that when we use the term we are not just talking about very large men
2476317 a man who is 5 foot 9 and weighs 203 pounds would be considered obese
2476318 we are not screening these obese men effectively and are not doing as good a job surgically as could be done
2476319 do not support the current health claims for soy protein in a general population
2476320 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2476321 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2476322 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2476323 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2476324 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2476325 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2476326 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2476327 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2476328 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2476329 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2476330 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2476331 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2476332 must be hit to keep the aggressor from doing this again
2476333 vigorously arming the georgian army to the teeth over the past few years thus directly encouraging the georgian leadership to invade south ossetia
2476334 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2476335 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2476336 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2476337 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2476338 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2476339 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2476340 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2476341 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

2476352 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2476353 me and faye made an agreement when we reached a certain level of fund raising i would receive a paycheck
2476354 my family suffered while i was working 70 80 100 hours a week
2476355 all along this was intended to be a grass roots campaign and he knows that
2476356 but i made it clear i did not expect to have more money than what i need for materials and advertising
2476357 while he was here i think he did a wonderful job as campaign manager
2476358 it was just when he moved to california he could no longer be effective
2476359 we hope shell find competent professional assistance in her campaign
2476360 you made it to your due date you can stay in there till the 8th
2476361 as soon as they put her on my belly she was looking at me fascinated with her eyes wide open
2476362 profane offensive and directed at two subordinate employees in his chain of command
2476363 manhandled one of these employees to the point of pain while in a public place
2476364 he just seemed to have a pretty good buzz going
2476365 it seemed like he was having a good time but it just seemed like it went a little too far
2476366 the first time i met and listened to a zionist i cannot tell you how suspicious i was of every word he said many ideas crossed my mind when i heard him speak it took me almost a year to overcome my suspicion
2476367 het ging zeer goed en het weer viel zeer goed mee
2476368 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2476369 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2476370 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2476371 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2476372 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2476373 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2476374 this procedure marks the culmination of 15 years of advances that have made surgery less invasive in order to improve safety and reduce recovery time
2476375 internal incisions such as in the uterus are less painful and may allow for quicker recovery than incisions in the abdominal wall
2476376 the booster can be given if it has been at least four weeks after the first dose
2476377 this study is significant because previous findings have been contradictory and the present investigation includes the largest number of heart attacks in an elderly group to date
2476378 our findings make a persuasive case that adiponectin is in fact associated with an increase in heart disease risk in older persons
2476379 this study shows that this abundant product of fat cells is a marker and perhaps even a mediator of worsened outcomes in persons aged 65 years and older
2476380 the cognitive impairment during the biological night was twice as large as during the normal time of awakening the biological morning
2476381 this is especially important considering that already following awakening during the morning the cognitive impairment can be more detrimental than staying awake all night and has been shown to be comparable to the effects of alcoholic intoxication
2476382 a week or two before maybe two weeks gradually move them over from a summer schedule to a school schedule
2476383 if we leave you alone well be dragging you out of bed
2476384 youre fighting human nature here by making some of these kids get up early
2476385 it really means some very strict control of the environment
2476386 work with the school board to change the start times
2476387 there are a lot of her friends who may have come forward two or three weeks ago and talked to the media but they are certainly not now
2476388 casey cant have all those different hair lengths and hairdos within a matter of a month
2476389 those photos range from when she was 18 to june 13
2476390 i remember thinking wow wow what a great job shes doing
2476391 a good hearted person and someone who liked to have fun
2476392 it is a carefully done study that strongly confirms the relationship between salt and hypertension high blood pressure
2476393 the power of this study is that it includes a very large cohort
2476394 the study clearly showed that people who had elevated salt intake were the ones who had high blood pressure that was independent of the genotype for this specific gene
2476395 it is clear that this is the tip of the iceberg
2476396 the hypothesis they tested was reasonable but they only tested one gene
2476397 the vast majority of the people we know who have high blood pressure do not carry a gene that we know of
2476398 you cant worry about your genotype because you cant do anything about it
2476399 this study reaffirms that salt intake has a significant effect on blood pressure and that is clearly something that you can control
2476400 our study documented that hrt might be considered a useful tool to identify heart failure patients at high risk of death including high risk of dying suddenly
2476401 hrt may help physicians more effectively manage heart failure patients by indicating the need for more frequent follow up visits at specialized heart failure units and more intensely applied therapy including icd implantation in high risk patients
2476402 breast feeding is associated with resilience against the psychosocial stress linked with parental divorce separation
2476403 theres a lot less verbal communication but lots of tactile communication and eye contact that promotes positive physiological responses
2476404 breast feeding does seem to suppress stress responses in babies and it does seem that theres a protective effect
2476405 in terms of the biological possibility breast milk is pretty amazing stuff and the tactile interaction that goes along with breast feeding does have an influence on the development of neurons
2476406 for most mothers breast feeding doesnt come naturally if the baby doesnt latch on it can lead to feelings of failure and concern about whether or not the baby is getting enough milk women need lots of encouragement and education
2476407 breast feeding is something for mothers and babies to enjoy a time for them to cherish and nurture each other
2476408 we say people have to realize that china is a country we need to know were all affected by what happens there
2476409 were looking at a job that could take a gazillion people many many years to do
2476410 they just assumed no one outside of china would care
2476411 in the early videos you dont see us at all
2476412 now we realize we have to incorporate more of our own voices it makes everything more personal
2476413 suppose the party leader doesnt want to remove the minister
2476414 there are two great sins in the world the sin of ignorance and the sin of stupidity only the former may be overcome
2476415 the rope on the feeder pole is 7 feet tall which gives you a general idea of how tall the bear is
2476416 its for hunting season so we know where the deer are but the bear seems to like it better
2476417 its a florida black bear and he probably tips the scale at 350 or 400 pounds easily
2476418 for 150 years the relationship among the various chipman families of delaware and maryland have been misstated and misunderstood
2476419 if you do not have documentary evidence of facts and dates but they are generally accepted will you list them just the same putting a mark side of each
2476420 there have been several family histories of the chipman family a recent one being john hale chipman a chipman genealogy norwell mass 1970 which though not adequately documented is generally good

2476509 during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant

2476515 it was the most perfect time to start a web site about zune and i was one of the first few to create a zune related site
2476516 bidding was getting close to the buy it now price and i didnt want to lose zuneboards over a few thousand dollars
2476517 my first acquisition was a graphic site from someone in italy i was blown away when i found out he was 16
2476518 it is so easy to make money on the internet web development made for adsense sites affiliate marketing paid to post and the list goes on
2476519 i guess thats one reason why i am so thankful to god not everyone has the mentality and understanding of how things work online as i do
2476520 i only spent 30 minutes online a day on zuneboards i could go on vacation any time i wanted
2476521 thirdly i felt that i wasnt doing my best to really make zuneboards grow to its full capabilities
2476522 i felt a new ownership would really bring in fresh leaders that were really motivated and focused on the growth of zuneboards

2476530 kabinet yang ditubuhkan menerusi cara itu dari segi moralnya tidak ada kredibiliti parlimen sendiri akan tercemar badan eksekutif dan penggubal undang undang dua cabang penting dalam tabir urus akan dianggap oleh rakyat sebagai institusi yang kehilangan integriti
2476531 saiz dan skala lompat parti yang diusahakannya itu amat sukar hendak dibayangkan pernahkah terjadi di dunia ini sebuah kerajaan yang mempunyai lebih 58 kerusi daripada gabungan pembangkang diancam dijatuhkan hanya kerana seorang individu yang tidak berada dalam parlimen sentiasa mendabik dada kononnya sejumlah ahli parlimen akan lompat parti pada tarikh tertentu
2476532 jika gimik lompat parti terus mengancam ketenteraman negara ia adalah disebabkan rakyat tahu bahawa pada satu ketika dulu anwar sebagai pemimpin bn memainkan peranan penting dalam menjatuhkan kerajaan negeri pbs parti bersatu sabah yang dipilih secara demokrasi di sabah pada 1994
2476533 dalam demokrasi wakil rakyat yang dipilih menerusi platform tertentu perlu mengembalikan mandat itu kepada rakyat dan melepaskan kerusinya sebelum berpaling tadah menyertai parti lain ini yang dikatakan menghormati pengundi
2476534 bilangan yang sudah bersetuju melompat parti itu sudah cukup selesa untuk membolehkan kami membentuk kerajaan

2476540 researchers have long wanted to find a way to move a patients disease into the test tube to develop cells that could be cultured into the many tissues relevant to diseases of the blood the brain and the heart for example
2476541 now we have a way to do just that to derive pluripotent cells from patients with disease which means the cells can make any tissue and can grow forever
2476542 this enables us to model thousands of conditions using classical cell culture techniques
2476543 theyre not going to force me to resign ive done nothing wrong im going to fight this to the end

2476552 i did not expect a miracle here butanyway its water under the bridge now
2476553 once i shot a nine in the third series it really unnerved me suddenly i realised i could not afford to make any more mistakes and that affected my subsequent performance
2476554 this was a horrific incident which could have had worse consequences

2476560 id been showing my paintings in galleries for a while and i wanted to provide all these amazingly talented film artisans i was working with in visual effects an opportunity to show their art to the public in a gallery setting
2476561 i picked up still photography as a way to explore my own creative instincts with more freedom patrick had this great idea to help all us closet artists step out of the shadows a little
2476562 we were overwhelmed with the response to our little show
2476563 we really wanted to raise the bar on the venue both in size as well as stature in the art community
2476564 we thought bergamot station is the perfect place to have the show
2476565 the james gray gallery at bergamot has an amazing space and they were excited about the doing the show with us

2476574 wir werden die tiere jeweils montags und mittwochs f ttern und beobachten welchen arm sie benutzen zus tzlich haben wir eigens f r diese untersuchung ungewohnte objekte entwickelt und viel spielzeug besorgt das wir in den becken platzieren

2476576 con zapatero la reforma de la financiaci n auton mica corre el peligro de convertirse en otra gran chapuza de los socialistas
2476577 cada vez que el ejecutivo central da un paso adelante le siguen dos hacia atr s
2476578 es necesario que la reforma del sistema de financiaci n auton mica se realice multilateralmente con garant as para la solidaridad y la interterritorialidad pero tambi n con la vista fija en que el peso de la variable poblacional debe ser inapelable y no nicamente una cuesti n m s que se pierda entre el amasijo de condicionantes
2476579 el problema viene cuando rodr guez zapatero no se atreve a hablar claro y a decirnos a todos los espa oles en qu aspectos se va a centrar la reforma parece que l prefiere colocarse al sol que m s calienta decir que s a todo y luego ya veremos lo que pasa exactamente como ha hecho con catalu a que ha visto como las promesas realizadas por el gobierno socialista han ca do en saco roto
2476580 catalu a acaba de comprobar lo que los valencianos ya sabemos desde hace cuatro a os pues vemos c mo el gobierno de zapatero ha incumplido el plazo que recoge el estatut para la negociaci n del reparto de fondos
2476581 si esto ha pasado en una autonom a gobernada por compa eros y socios de los que dirigen el ejecutivo central veremos qu pasa con nuestra comunitat sin duda una de las m s perjudicadas de espa a por su infrafinanciaci n y el gran olvido desde que zapatero lleg a la moncloa
2476582 hace 25 a os que la comunidad valenciana se llama comunidad valenciana y el pspv la llama pa s valenci
2476583 en lugar de estar defendiendo a los valencianos est defendiendo sus postulados ante madrid
2476584 ha supuesto un frenazo importante en la compra de viviendas por parte de ciudadanos extranjeros en la comunitat
2476585 dicen s al trasvase del ebro s a la financiaci n
2476586 s a la defensa de la comunitat y su modelo de construcci n para que vuelva a invertirse capital extranjero
2476587 lo que hemos escuchado del pspv es un no a todo
2476588 si quieren que los ciudadanos extranjeros tengan seguridad en la comunitat y sigan comprando vivienda invirtiendo y haciendo una buena imagen de la comunitat
2476589 que el estado del dinero que les aportamos nos devuelva 1 000 millones de euros m s para sanidad educaci n y servicios sociales adem s del dinero de la dependencia
2476590 entiendo que es lo que el pspv deber a estar plante ndose
2476591 es el mejor comienzo de espa a en los juegos en toda su historia

2476596 the creation of baggames began on a surf trip to tamarindo costa rica where the evenings were the perfect downtime to play backgammon
2476597 the problem was we didnt bring a game because no one wanted to lug around a full sized board in our already stuffed backpacks we could have brought along a travel version but who really likes playing with those tiny little pieces on a miniature board anyway no one in town had even heard of backgammon much less had one for sale our only option was to conjure up our own makeshift board we found a small sign company to draw up the board per our description and used colones costa rican currency for the checkers
2476598 the author is right but that wont stop downer from giving it a good old english style public school try itll be 30 year before the truth downer has never been in touch with real people even on the tv the other night downer referred to downers student days and downers tussles with the left wing at college in england downer was is a product of downers environment not necessarily ours for downer a career in jolly old politics was ordained to favour the ruling elite and their interests and machinations it was all downer knew fortunately downer is a disappearing breed downer job a job for the boys

2476606 nos conozcamos personas con nombres raros poco comunes o propios porque como es mi caso muchos no hemos tenido la oportunidad de coincidir con otros semejantes que tengan nuestro mismo nombre
2476607 en una jornada que a buen seguro va a ser inolvidable y va a constituir el punto de inicio de muchas buenas relaciones de amistad para el futuro
2476608 lo normal es que la mayor parte de las personas tengan nombres m s comunes y conozcan a otros semejantes con su mismo nombre algo a lo que casi no dan importancia porque entra dentro de lo habitual pero para los que no hemos tenido esta oportunidad se trata de algo muy especial porque nosotros por nuestro nombre tambi n somos especiales
2476609 the chars must be on pvp server and transfer must be up
2476610 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2476611 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2476612 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2476613 if you still want me to run i will run
2476614 with only 60 percent of democrats choosing him johnson received 41 076 votes with more than 67 percent of 10th district republicans backing mchenry he still only got 34 457 votes
2476615 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2476616 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2476617 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2476618 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea
2476619 when information is in the public domain it is game over
2476620 information on your computer may get protection under the law but on someone elses it gets less protection
2476621 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and its going to get worse before it gets better
2476622 giving them our data is a clear and present risk
2476623 how hard would it be to target someone as a political activist or a person with aids
2476624 we have great ambitions in warship building currently 38 vessels including one aircraft carrier three frigates six submarines one landing ship and four anti submarine vessels are under development
2476625 induction of new aircraft including mig 29k fighters maritime reconnaissance aircraft airborne early warning and control systems awacs and unmanned aerial vehicles uavs is in the offing
2476626 by 2022 the indian navy will have a fleet of 160 plus ships three aircraft carriers and 400 aircraft of different types extensive satellite surveillance and networking will be there
2476627 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2476628 junior guard patrick beverley will not compete for the razorbacks in the 2008 2009 basketball season
2476629 our basketball team is only going to be as good as our three juniors
2476630 we are excited about the young guys and what they are going to bring to the university of arkansas this season and the future but first year guys they are going to be a little up and down

2476635 nobody has ever run it like were going to run it
2476636 its hard in this league to consistently pound and pound the ball
2476637 we do have two good running backs in ben tate and brad lester
2476638 but your quarterback is also considered a running back in this offense
2476639 you got to be able to run it to win
2476640 i think i do understand that in the game of football building and changing a program that it is a process
2476641 well i would think if you asked my family they would say im really really patient
2476642 said petrino who went 41 9 as coach at louisville running the same offense
2476643 last year i can count on one hand how many big plays we had over 15 20 yards
2476644 and you know its tough when youre trying to win in this league consistently by playing defense and just trying to play smash mouth on offense
2476645 he got hit early in practice and had some neck pain
2476646 at that time we just went with university protocol and activated our procedures that were gonna do
2476647 its too early to say exactly whats wrong with him
2476648 it happened probably in period 14 right after our break
2476649 its kind of hard to focus because youre looking at the ambulance
2476650 we tackled a lot better than we did in the spring the first day in pads
2476651 we have this perimeter drill where its not real fair on the defense because you take the two defensive tackles out so that the linebackers can get blocked and you can get the ball outside and youre really working tackling by the secondary and linebackers and we tackled much better than we did in spring
2476652 i didnt like the way we executed our pass skelly
2476653 and when he has trouble snapping they put me in
2476654 get them in and out of the huddle were wasting time arkansas top offense started fine with a casey dick play action touchdown throw to carlton salters against a coverage bust but sputtered in much of the rest of the team periods including pass skeleton
2476655 we tackled a lot better than we did in the spring on the first day in pads
2476656 i didnt like the way we executed our pass skelly skeleton we usually do better than that the defensive units stonewalled a good number of running plays like when linebacker jermaine love knocked the helmet off of freshman dennis johnson
2476657 youve got to stay in that lane and keep going straight he decided to cut back so i had to give him a good hit the defense also smelled out the play action with defensive end antwain robinson forcing nathan dick to throw it away on one play
2476658 hes been real sharp i think hes dropped one ball in five days so ive been very happy with the way hes played
2476659 london crawford our speed guy he did a good job of taking out the corner and safety on my side and just really made my job that much easier
2476660 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2476661 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2476662 he got hit early in practice and had some neck pain and then all of a sudden he came over and laid down started having some pain up his neck
2476663 he went over to the sideline and was ok for a while and then all of a sudden he started getting some shooting pains up in his neck area so thats when our trainer joe sheehan went through the proper procedures
2476664 we said a prayer for him and hope hes all right
2476665 his son ameer now 14 also fired the russian designed rifle which has a firing rate of 600 rounds a minute
2476666 the death toll is likely to increase because heavy rain is still falling and the rivers in the area are rising
2476667 the water and walls of mud came at night when everybody was sleeping
2476668 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation
2476669 this year were probably going to surpass 2007 easily just given the way were starting
2476670 the yakima valley is a huge player these are big operations that are difficult to track down
2476671 they use fictitious names they put property in daughters wives names to conceal identity and try to thwart law enforcement from going forward with civil forfeiture
2476672 no lo conozco pero escuch que rudy ulloa el choferata de kirchner anda con 100 palos verdes y lo quiere comprar
2476673 our basketball team is only going to be as good as our three juniors
2476674 we are excited about the young guys and what they are going to bring to the university of arkansas this season and the future but with first year guys there is going to be an adjustment period
2476675 they are going to be a little up and down thats just the way it is
2476676 tiens tiens jessaierais bien de faire des yaourts au chocolat blanc
2476677 thats one of the main reasons i wanted to come here
2476678 people and defenses think we throw the ball a lot and all of that so they might back up and we can bust them for 5 6 yards a play then when they come up well bust them over the top
2476679 thats what i always tell recruits make them show you on film
2476680 they told me it was half and half and i trust in the coaches believe in the coaches
2476681 i knew theyd find ways to get me the ball
2476682 hes always been a playmaker so i think michael will be the lead guy
2476683 at the same time i can see us playing two or three different tailbacks
2476684 i wont have to handle a load like mcfadden did
2476685 but the load that i will have to carry im sure ill be able to handle that well be a lot more balanced this year so itll be a lot easier on the running backs and receivers as a whole
2476686 they talk about being the no 1 offense in the nation so if were going to be the no 1 offense in the nation everybodys going to have to be on the field
2476687 when you look at our depth at running back theyre going to have to jump in there and go
2476688 i think the greatest thing is that they have an opportunity to be special players the way they can move their hands and i was impressed with how quickly they learn and how focused they were they paid attention to detail in the different things that we have an opportunity to do with them
2476689 the next couple weeks will tell who is going to step forward and get the most carries
2476690 ich will f r das amt des ministerpr sidenten hier an der saar kandidieren

2476706 es regnet noch immer stark und wir f rchten dass es weitere tote gibt der pegel des red river steigt rasch
2476707 it was a quality show by the archers though olympic is a different ball game altogether we are happy with them
2476708 it was amazing to see a greenhorn like her rising to the occasion
2476709 is the living body living because it is a body
2476710 no problem well just brainwash everyone and impose our own point of view upon this world through publicity public relations and propaganda weve done it before with great success and then well just convince ourselves we have convinced everyone and go ahead with our delusional plans
2476711 you put the kettle on and ill go cut the grass

2476716 dont worry ill be watching this one like a hawk
2476717 mars is not a dead planet it undergoes climate changes that are even more pronounced than on earth
2476718 weve gone from seeing as a dead planet for three plus billion years to one that has been alive in recent times
2476719 the finding has changed our perspective from a planet that has been dry and dead to one that is icy and active
2476720 of all the solar system planets has the climate most like that of earth both are sensitive to small changes in orbital parameters
2476721 now were seeing that mars like earth is in a period between ice ages
2476722 these extreme changes on mars provide perspective for interpreting what we see on earth landforms on that appear to be related to climate changes help us calibrate and understand similar landforms on earth furthermore the range of microenvironments in the antarctic dry valleys helps us read the mars record
2476723 i want to have at least one legitimate child in my life
2476724 co operating for the good of the industry in any way is a sign of weakness
2476725 boards on the bench that i use as secondary communications devices when developing projects that require serial communications having a second controller to send rs232 messages to the primary target board is quite convenient
2476726 never mind nobody knows or thinks about the past and man remains objectionable
2476727 but this does not ensure a smooth ride at the forthcoming nsg meeting some members have very strong positions and they are bound to raise them at the meeting the official said
2476728 three persons including the driver died on the spot three others were injured the injured were rushed to the hospital and their condition is said to be critical the police said
2476729 somebody was laying on my legs a lady next to me she had her arm crushed up the lady who was on my left a man was on top of her
2476730 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2476731 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2476732 we have requested law enforcement agencies to be alert for any buses being operated by angel tours or iguala busmex since they are not authorized to operate legally
2476733 if found on the road we want law enforcement to immediately stop and place the vehicles out of service
2476734 this happened like katrina like challenger what we can do is pray
2476735 god will comfort them tell people to keep trusting in god do not blame anybody do not ask why now we just help each other to get through this
2476736 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2476737 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2476738 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2476739 im just so disappointed i put in all i had but seventh wasnt what i came here for
2476740 i got well ahead in the fight but i felt my legs tire which was a reflection of how i felt all day
2476741 to get countered from such a comfortable position was obviously disappointing
2476742 it was nothing to do with my training my preparations went really well and i comfortably made the weight
2476743 a package in line with the referees wishes was guaranteed however negotions broke down

2476752 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy

2476754 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2476755 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2476756 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2476757 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2476758 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2476759 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2476760 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2476761 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2476762 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2476763 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2476764 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2476765 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
2476766 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2476767 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
2476768 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2476769 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2476770 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2476771 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2476772 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2476773 just so you all know we did set a record
2476774 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2476775 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2476776 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2476777 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2476778 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2476779 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2476780 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2476781 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2476782 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2476783 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2476784 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2476785 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2476786 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2476787 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2476788 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2476789 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2476790 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2476791 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2476792 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2476793 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2476794 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2476795 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2476796 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2476797 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2476798 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2476799 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2476800 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2476801 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2476802 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2476803 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2476804 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2476805 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2476806 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2476807 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2476808 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2476809 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2476810 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2476811 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2476812 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2476813 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2476814 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2476815 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2476816 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2476817 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2476818 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2476819 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2476820 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2476821 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2476822 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2476823 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2476824 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2476825 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2476826 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2476827 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2476828 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2476829 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2476830 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2476831 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2476832 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2476833 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2476834 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2476835 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2476836 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2476837 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2476838 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2476839 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2476840 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2476841 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2476842 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2476843 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2476844 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2476845 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2476846 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2476847 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2476848 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2476849 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2476850 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured
2476851 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2476852 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2476853 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2476854 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2476855 i think global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2476856 but i think that global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2476857 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2476858 medical science has proven that the keys to changing the outcom
2476859 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2476860 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2476861 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2476862 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2476863 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
2476864 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2476865 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2476866 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2476867 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2476868 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2476869 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2476870 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2476871 whatever the proper resolution of the extraordinarily important questions presented the public interest clearly favors further consideration of issues before defendants are required to take actions that may forever alter the constitutional balance of separation of powers
2476872 the bush cheney administration continues to defy our validly issued congressional subpoenas for information relevant to the politicization of the department of justice by this white house
2476873 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2476874 god called them home and he called them at a good time
2476875 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2476876 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2476877 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2476878 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2476879 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2476880 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2476881 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2476882 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2476883 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2476884 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2476885 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2476886 we are dealing with absolutely criminal and crazy acts of irresponsible and reckless decision makers which is on the ground producing dramatic and tragic consequences
2476887 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a standown by all troops and call for end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august the sixth
2476888 battalion task forces have fully liberated tskhinvali of georgian armed forces and started pushing georgian units out of the area of responsibility of the peacekeeping forces
2476889 our peacekeepers along with reinforcement units are currently conducting an operation to force the georgian side to accept peace
2476890 the people responsible for this humanitarian disaster need to be held liable for what they have done
2476891 the aggression launched by the georgian side against the south ossetian civilians and russian peacekeepers
2476892 what they dont realize is if they have this kind of genetic make up they are on their way to dependency
2476893 what we dont know is far greater than what we do know
2476894 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2476895 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2476896 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2476897 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2476898 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2476899 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2476900 wir werden um die zwei millarden pfund bieten und die passagierzahl von heute 24 millionen auf 40 millionen erh hen
2476901 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2476902 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
2476903 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
2476904 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
2476905 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
2476906 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
2476907 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
2476908 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
2476909 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
2476910 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
2476911 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
2476912 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
2476913 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
2476914 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
2476915 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
2476916 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
2476917 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
2476918 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
2476919 real results by the end of my first term in office
2476920 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2476921 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2476922 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
2476923 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling
2476924 environmentalist did not make gas go to over 4 gallon
2476925 i dont want to have to change my life even it it benefits society as a whole
2476926 humans are an infinitessimally small part of the global eco system
2476927 its the downturn that has made greenery look unappetising but it may yet prove to do more than anything to save the planet
2476928 it runs on biodiesel and im gonna put solar on it someday
2476929 recently mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2476930 mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2476931 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
2476932 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2476933 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2476934 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2476935 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2476936 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2476937 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2476938 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2476939 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2476940 the charter will strengthen asean and instil it with a renewed sense of purpose while reaffirming key asean principles and objectives
2476941 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
2476942 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2476943 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2476944 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2476945 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2476946 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2476947 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2476948 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2476949 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2476950 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2476951 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2476952 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2476953 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2476954 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2476955 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2476956 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2476957 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2476958 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2476959 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2476960 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2476961 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2476962 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2476963 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2476964 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2476965 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2476966 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2476967 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
2476968 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the
2476969 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to
2476970 since june the uk top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum it turns out that chris browns
2476971 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2476972 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2476973 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2476974 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2476975 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2476976 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2476977 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2476978 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2476979 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2476980 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2476981 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2476982 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2476983 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2476984 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2476985 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2476986 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2476987 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2476988 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2476989 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2476990 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2476991 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2476992 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2476993 the bravery of young sophie and the delezio family is an inspiration

2476998 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2476999 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2477000 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2477001 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2477002 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2477003 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2477004 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2477005 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2477006 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2477007 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2477008 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2477009 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side

2477011 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
2477012 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2477013 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2477014 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2477015 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2477016 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2477017 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2477018 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2477019 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2477020 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2477021 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2477022 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2477023 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

2477033 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2477034 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2477035 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2477036 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2477037 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2477038 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2477039 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2477040 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2477041 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2477042 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2477043 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2477044 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2477045 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore

2477051 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation
2477052 this year were probably going to surpass 2007 easily just given the way were starting
2477053 the yakima valley is a huge player these are big operations that are difficult to track down
2477054 they use fictitious names they put property in daughters wives names to conceal identity and try to thwart law enforcement from going forward with civil forfeiture
2477055 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2477056 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2477057 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2477058 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2477059 the historical anomaly of dioceses that have nothing to do with the black community going all the way to africa to make these relationships
2477060 this is just another revisionist attempt to use anything to undermine the orthodox position of the church and spread the agenda of inclusiveness
2477061 as a person who knows what it means to be oppressed i refuse to allow my brothers and sisters in the faith to be discriminated against
2477062 very inappropriate to equate the struggle of blacks in africa or in the diaspora
2477063 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2477064 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
2477065 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2477066 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2477067 the snow isnt sticking and i was hoping to have a snowball fight with you
2477068 thats not fair at all you know im not supposed to hit a girl
2477069 they then proceeded to fuck after the post coital cigarette the boy shot the girl then himself the end
2477070 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2477071 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2477072 the continuation of arrests in the west bank is clearly showing that president mahmoud abbas is not interested in launching a comprehensive national dialogue to end the current crisis
2477073 this resolution expands the range of restrictive measures adopted by the u n security council
2477074 show restraint when granting new public loans for trade with iran and to also be vigilant on activities taken by financial institutions with banks based in iran
2477075 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2477076 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2477077 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2477078 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2477079 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2477080 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2477081 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2477082 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2477083 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2477084 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2477085 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2477086 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2477087 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a standdown by all troops
2477088 we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6th
2477089 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2477090 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2477091 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2477092 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2477093 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2477094 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2477095 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2477096 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2477097 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2477098 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2477099 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2477100 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2477101 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2477102 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2477103 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2477104 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2477105 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2477106 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2477107 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2477108 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2477109 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2477110 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2477111 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2477112 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2477113 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2477114 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2477115 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2477116 the palestinian authority is interested in releasing the biggest number of prisoners regardless of their political affiliations
2477117 the issue of prisoners held in israeli jails is a political issue which is no less important than other permanent status issues it can only be resolved by setting up a timetable for the release of all the prisoners
2477118 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2477119 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2477120 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2477121 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete

2477152 le meduse pungono la pelle delluomo grazie a particolari cellule gli cnidocisti che se toccate estroflettono dei filamenti urticanti che penetrano immediatamente nella pelle la sostanza urticante in realt una miscela di tre proteine a capacit paralizzante urticante e neurotossica subito dopo il contatto si avverte una sensazione di dolore bruciante e poi di prurito la medusa che pi frequentemente possiamo incontrare lungo le coste del mediterraneo la pelagia nucticola di dieci centimetri di diametro trasparente o violacea con lunghi filamenti spesso presente in branchi le meduse del mediterraneo sono per buona fortuna poco pericolose e provocano solo reazioni nel punto di contatto tuttavia capitare in un branco di meduse ed essere colpito su larga superficie del corpo pu essere pericoloso il reale pericolo deriva dal panico che segue appena percepito il dolore urente del contatto con le meduse occorre ricordare che allo stimolo doloroso il nostro organismo risponde liberando adrenalina che contrasta gli effetti delle tossine della medusa non cos per le meduse pi velenose come le sea wasp australiane che possono addirittura provocare la morte per arresto respiratorio aritmia cardiaca o shock in pochi minuti
2477153 la prima cosa non farsi prendere dal panico non gridare e respirare normalmente se si vicino alla riva raggiungerla ed uscire dallacqua se si al largo occorre richiamare lattenzione del natante pi vicino e farsi aiutare ad emergere una volta fuori dallacqua verificare che non vi siano parti di medusa rimaste attaccate alla pelle in questo caso devono essere tolte se non si dispone di mezzi di medicazione lunica cosa utile far scorrere acqua di mare sulla parte infiammata in questo modo si pu diluire la tossina non ancora penetrata evitare invece di grattarsi o di strofinare la sabbia o ricorrere a medicazioni estemporanee con ammoniaca aceto alcool o altri rimedi fai da te non si fa altro che peggiorare la situazione
2477154 la medicazione corretta va fatta con lapplicazione di gel astringente al cloruro dalluminio il gel astringente ha unimmediata azione antiprurito e blocca la diffusione delle tossine purtroppo non ancora comune in italia labitudine di portare con s un gel astringente al cloruro dalluminio che peraltro utile anche per le punture di zanzara limpiego di creme al cortisone o contenenti antistaminico non indicato perch questi farmaci entrano in azione dopo 30 minuti dallapplicazione cio quando il massimo della reazione si gi spenta naturalmente
2477155 se si evidenzia una reazione cutanea diffusa e sono evidenti difficolt respiratorie pallore sudorazione e disorientamento la cosa migliore chiamare il 118 e spiegare di cosa si tratta si riceveranno le istruzioni sul da farsi in attesa che arrivi il personale di pronto soccorso

2477229 in a road race it is expected that some riders will end up sacrificing themselves doing all the hard work so their teammates have a chance of winning but that choice was not open to him so he just rode as hard as he could

2477232 dazu haben wir sie in der zeit vor und nach der intubation also dem anschluss an eine lungenmaschine mit einem standardisierten fragebogen befragt
2477233 die als patienten sch tzen ihre lebensqualit t ein halbes jahr nach der intubation wesentlich besser ein als sie es vorher gedacht hatten und als ihre rzte und angeh rige ihnen attestierten
2477234 an unserer studie haben allerdings nur menschen teilnehmen k nnen die den willen zum weiterleben hatten
2477235 zum einen kann es nat rlich sein dass rzte und besucher zu als patienten in der regel immer sehr nett sind
2477236 dass das nicht der fall ist konnten wir in unserer studie allerdings zeigen die aufmerksamkeit unserer patienten war ebenso hoch wie die von gesunden probanden
2477237 das gehirn der als patienten reagiert sensibler auf positive reize
2477238 der gyrus supramarginalis etwa eine windung in der scheitel schl fenregion der gro hirnrinde die f r das erkennen positiver gesichter zust ndig ist ist st rker durchblutet diese hirnzellen sind also aktiver als bei gesunden

2477241 wir haben aber mit hirnscans zeigen k nnen dass die fantasie dieser menschen und ihr passives denken weiterhin funktionieren
2477242 niemand au er mir selbst kein au enstehender kein angeh riger darf ber mein leben entscheiden
2477243 generell d rfte niemand weder angeh rige und schon gar nicht rzte irgendwelche lebenserhaltenden ma nahmen unterlassen solange nicht eindeutig der hirntod festgestellt wurde kein gesunder wei wie er als kranker entscheiden w rde aber nat rlich denke auch ich bei sterbehilfe sofort erstmal an einen krebskranken der keine hoffnung mehr hat auch aus rztlicher sicht aber unsagbare schmerzen und der seinen liebsten partner bittet ihm zu helfen ihn von den qualen zu erl sen ja das sind vielleicht r hrselige f lle aber keine erdachten hier muss es einzelfallentscheidungen geben und eine generelle gesetzliche strafbarkeit ist verfehlt

2477246 i couldnt believe it i had a headache this morning i felt so terrible that i didnt know how id shoot so to win the first gold medal of this olympics is pretty amazing
2477247 wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2477248 im very happy and i think i did a very good job
2477249 today i have tried my best to compete whether or not this medal was the first gold
2477250 we have to focus on our own performance and this helps me to relax and not come under pressure
2477251 i didnt expect to be number one it was just the luck of the draw
2477252 im used as cannon fodder they said send the old bugger out there first and see what happens

2477273 my greatest concern is to see that every child is a wanted child
2477274 doris was one of the most wonderful happy intelligent and exciting leaders i have ever known
2477275 she was tough enough to command the respect of her male colleagues and they held her in awe
2477276 she was very solid and thoughtful and not at all reckless yet she was charming and gracious and even in the toughest of times could find something funny to say
2477277 dr carson was a mentor and an inspiration to us all
2477278 she was a woman who championed and pioneered so many causes related to the health and well being of women and children in particular all medical issues that would help with reproductive health
2477279 she was deeply interested in the issue of teenage pregnancy and was so proud of the bridge as a model for prevention of teen pregnancy and our success with the young people we serve
2477280 a date for his last day at the county has not been determined but his accrued time will be used through the end of 2008
2477281 this is definitely an opportunity for me as i approach full retirement
2477282 im leaving the county because this is a good opportunity for me ive enjoyed my time at the county and working with the commissioners
2477283 it was one of my biggest fears when we offered early retirement that we would lose people who have been key to the county operation for years
2477284 for bill to have this opportunity from the state is perfect timing for him i hate to see him go and cant blame him for accepting it
2477285 we will keep it a very open process and select the most qualified person for the job
2477286 i wish him the best and thank him for his service over the years
2477287 he always has stepped to the plate no matter what the situation has been weve had some troubling times in the county and bill has been a great friend and a great public servant
2477288 we can say that as long as the cash price is advertised and disclosed as a cash price prior to the sale
2477289 it is possible this may not be in violation of the statute
2477290 they merchants must advertise the cash price and credit card price as well as long as the disclosure is obvious to the customer its legal
2477291 we have been receiving other complaints on other gas stations and are investigating as well
2477292 i can tell you anecdotally that we have seen an increase in the number of complaints related to surcharges
2477293 people just assume that we put a surcharge to the card but what were doing is giving a cash discount
2477294 cash discount on fuel atm available inside save 10 cents per gallon
2477295 i wish i could take advantage of this but i dont carry that much cash with me
2477296 its easier for me to use the credit card and get points
2477297 but i usually dont pay attention and especially if im using my credit card
2477298 especially if im going to save 10 cents per gallon
2477299 too small to really incorporate into any kind of project

2477310 the chapmans recounted an extraordinary story telling how maria had the morning of the accident drawn a picture of a flower with six petals only one of which was coloured in
2477311 her father told larry king that next to the drawing of the flower she had written a word that shed never written before
2477312 the family told larry king they believe this last message was meant for them to assure them that one of their six children the six petals on their daughters flower was in heaven

2477318 his son then 12 didnt want to go to school because he thought the school was trying to kill him
2477319 for more than a decade parents of children with developmental and psychiatric problems have pushed to gain more access to mainstream schools and classrooms for their sons and daughters one unfortunate result some experts say is schools increasing use of precisely the sort of practices families hoped to avoid by steering clear of institutionalized settings takedowns isolation rooms restraining chairs with straps and worse
2477320 in april a 9 year old montreal boy with autism died of suffocation when a special education teacher wrapped him in a weighted blanket to calm him according to the coroners report two michigan public school students with autism have died while being held on the ground in so called prone restraint
2477321 behavior problems in school are way up and theres good reason to believe that the use of these procedures is up too
2477322 for teachers who have many other responsibilities not least to teach managing even one child with a disability can add a wild card to the day
2477323 during the 2005 6 school year an 8 year old with a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder and mild mental retardation was repeatedly locked in a seclusion room alone adjacent to the classroom at least 31 times in a single year
2477324 in another school a teacher held a 12 year old with a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder face down on the floor straddling him at his hips and holding his hands behind his back
2477325 dr peterson the nebraska professor illustrates the challenges by citing two recent cases in iowa in one the parents of an 11 year old who died while being held down called for a ban on restraints in the other parents charged that a school failed their son by not restraining him the boy ran away and drowned

2477330 this is the real thing we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
2477331 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
2477332 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based

2477355 the more things change the more they stay the same
2477356 our peacekeepers and the units attached to them are at present launching operations to compel the georgians to stand down they are also responsible for the protection of the lives of the civilian population we are occupied with this at the present moment
2477357 we delivered munitions and provisions to the russian peacekeepers and we are evacuating the wounded
2477358 conducting operations to locate the weapons emplacements of the georgian military units that fired on the russian positions last night in order to fix them in place and destroy them
2477359 taking into account the confused situation in the south ossetian combat zone as georgian artillery continues to target residential areas and it fires indiscriminately at innocent civilians and at injured evacuated to hospital we dispatched a tactical group composed of units from the 58 th army and the spetsnaz to tskhinvali ordering them to arrive in the most expeditious manner
2477360 the transport of the injured to hospital is hindered by sniper fire from saboteur units who are hiding in nearby urban areas they stint on no one
2477361 georgian military units continue to fire into the city using artillery and grad rockets
2477362 situation remains confused the injured are in a most difficult position they can be evacuated to the main hospital in the city but the hospital has been deliberately targeted by the georgian forces howitzer fire is directed at it and the patients have to be treated in the basements of the building practically speaking there is little that we can do for them
2477363 now the city is entirely cleared of major georgian military units but the situation on the heights around the city is confused

2477365 fred michalak had his best game at 10 for us and i was impressed how frans and ruan stuck to the team thing by playing around him
2477366 they had to do a lot of defending and weve seen them attack better than that but it was an impressive performance
2477367 for the boks to leave out two players like that it says a lot for the depth in this country its pretty spooky really
2477368 i think he carried the ball up around 15 or 16 times with a bit more experience he is going to be a useful player
2477369 south africa are fortunate to have so many good loose forwards like koster and jean deysel coming through you also have a guy up at the lions called willem alberts and the bulls arent short of talent either

2477373 seeing how hurt they were and the pain i had caused them was pretty humbling and gut wrenching the last thing i want to do is hurt the people around me

2477383 but what interested me most were the people and their adventures brave people like scott and shackleton sporting heroes like stanley matthews and even some politicians though at 10 it was hard to know what they actually did he added

2477387 this is probably my shot at a medal and afterwards ill go home to sorrento maybe open a gym he added
2477388 the first rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club he recited
2477389 there is an attitude in the modelling industry that black models do not sell models that end up in magazines tend to be very very light skinned or asian

2477422 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous of escalation in the crisis
2477423 today i woke up at 4oclock w coz im very tired this week
2477424 de heerser over de russische aarde is steeds de rus dit was zo en zal steeds zo zijn
2477425 als ik moet zorgen dat ik niet leef om te kunnen leven waar dient het dan allemaal toe
2477426 er is geen wet tegen buitenlanders ze komen hier met een stapel geld en kopen huizen appartementen en bedrijven op de rechten van geboren russen worden met voeten getreden
2477427 de heerser over de russische aarde is steeds de rus dit was zo en zal steeds zo zijn
2477428 wanneer na de tsjechische regering ook polen een verdrag met de vs ondertekent voor de stationering kunnen wij een nauwere samenwerking met minsk overwegen
2477429 de heerser over de russische aarde is steeds de rus dit was zo en zal steeds zo zijn
2477430 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2477431 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2477432 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2477433 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2477434 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2477435 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2477436 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2477437 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2477438 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2477439 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2477440 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2477441 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2477442 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2477443 de heerser over de russische aarde is steeds de rus dit was zo en zal steeds zo zijn
2477444 to the dad who is always there to help or fix
2477445 happy fathers day and i hope i dont make you mad today
2477446 people often say that motivation doesnt last well neither does bathing thats why we recommend it daily
2477447 i have missed more than 9000 shots in my career i have lost almost 300 games on 26 occasions i have been entrusted to take the game winning shot and missed and i have failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why i succeed
2477448 if you would not be forgotten as soon as youre dead and rotten either write things worth reading or do things worth writing
2477449 it is not a lack of love but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages

2477454 the antichrist will offer the most successful project for solving the world crisis from the perspective of political and social wisdom which would establish a uniform political and social order in the whole world
2477455 evil spirits dispersed in the universe will awaken a general inflated opinion about the antichrist in man a general enthusiasm and an irresistible attraction for him
2477456 will throw a gleaming veil of kindness and truth over the mystery of iniquity
2477457 in an image which will seduce everyone he will come as a humble kind hater of falsehood as he will say about himself rejecting idols preferring piety and kindness loving the poor bearing extremely handsome features constant sweet to everyone respecting especially the jewish nation because they will be awaiting his coming he will take sly measures to please everyone will not accept gifts nor speak in anger will not show an overcast countenance but will entice the world with a decorous exterior until he is enthroned
2477458 i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
2477459 her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the land
2477460 and in the latter times of their kingdom when the transgressors are come to the full a king of fierce countenance and understanding dark sentences shall stand up
2477461 even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders
2477462 that innate and acquired evil gradually accumulating in a long line of ancestors of the antichrist transmitted with each new generation will reach such a degree of force in the antichrist himself which human nature is capable of containing revealing and enduring the evil which lives in mankind will reach the highest limit of its development in him
2477463 foreseeing future depravity of his will the antichrists will allow the devil to inhabit him
2477464 will come out of the gloomiest and remotest lands of the earth to which the devil is banished
2477465 mans enemy clothed in human nature gods adversary the demon usurping gods name will appear in the world before christs coming
2477466 from a defiled virgin will actually be born his the devils weapon
2477467 the antichrist will come and be born as st ippolit of rome declares from a depraved wife and self styled virgin which is from the jews from the tribe of dan
2477468 dan shall be a serpent on the way an adder in the path
2477469 for all jews a national declaration that jesus christ was veritably the messiah
2477470 if thou hadst known even now at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes
2477471 with this day with the rejection of the messiah the fate of the israelite nation was decided for eternity
2477472 evil spirits dispersed in the universe will awaken a general inflated opinion about the antichrist in man a general enthusiasm and an irresistible attraction for him
2477473 will throw a gleaming veil of kindness and truth over the mystery of iniquity
2477474 in an image which will seduce everyone he will come as a humble kind hater of falsehood as he will say about himself rejecting idols preferring piety and kindness loving the poor bearing extremely handsome features constant sweet to everyone respecting especially the jewish nation because they will be awaiting his coming he will take sly measures to please everyone will not accept gifts nor speak in anger will not show an overcast countenance but will entice the world with a decorous exterior until he is enthroned
2477475 a beckoning voice will resound in mans society expressing urgent need for a genius of geniuses who would raise material development and prosperity to the highest degree and establish affluence on earth
2477476 when you will hear that christ has appeared on earth know then that this is the antichrist
2477477 the world or mankind will not recognize the antichrist it will recognize him as christ it will proclaim him christ
2477478 we are dealing with absolutely criminal and crazy acts of irresponsible and reckless decision makers which is on the ground producing dramatic and tragic consequences
2477479 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a standown by all troops and call for end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august the sixth
2477480 battalion task forces have fully liberated tskhinvali of georgian armed forces and started pushing georgian units out of the area of responsibility of the peacekeeping forces
2477481 our peacekeepers along with reinforcement units are currently conducting an operation to force the georgian side to accept peace
2477482 the people responsible for this humanitarian disaster need to be held liable for what they have done
2477483 the aggression launched by the georgian side against the south ossetian civilians and russian peacekeepers

2477499 if you really loved me youd want me to be happy
2477500 if the republican party continues to ignore its traditional conservative base then the party is headed to oblivion
2477501 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
2477502 government is not reason it is not eloquence it is force like fire it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master firearms are second only to the constitution in importance they are the peoples libertys teeth
2477503 at this juncture in the infowar discussions of religion a dozen christian sects squabbling
2477504 now our peacekeepers are waging a fierce battle with regular forces from the georgian army in the southern region of tskhinvali
2477505 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state reloaded not comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2477506 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2477507 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian disaster is gathering pace
2477508 the georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years
2477509 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened the fire at their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2477510 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legal document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2477511 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a requirement because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2477512 we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years
2477513 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2477514 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2477515 i was in the hospital yesterday where i saw many civilian wounded the hospital was later destroyed by a georgian jet i dont know whether the wounded were still there
2477516 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2477517 they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now
2477518 today im going to sign a decree to introduce martial law in georgia and present it to parliament for approval
2477519 there is no bombing of tskhinvali street battles are continuing in the city involving our soldiers we do not plan to bomb our own servicemen in tskhinvali
2477520 most of south ossetias territory has been liberated and is now controlled by georgia i call on russia to stop bombarding peaceful georgian towns
2477521 is heading a meeting to discuss a series of urgent measures to stop the violence in south ossetia to protect the civilian population and russian citizens in the conflict zone
2477522 the goal of georgias actions in the conflict zone is to establish peace in the region and we will not stop until we have attained this goal
2477523 georgia has tried to build a fortified structure a block post near the nuli village our reaction to such actions will be very tough because we see them as bandits who open fire on our civilians
2477524 russia is putting in a great deal of effort to promote the idea of peace talks we treat such initiatives with understanding and believe they are necessary
2477525 we insist on the talks including russia and north ossetia we will not hold one to one discussions with georgia
2477526 is acting as a constructive and responsible mediator the aim of which is to diminish the tensions to restart the negotiating process aimed at settling of the conflict
2477527 we have an influx of volunteers coming into the republic so far we see no necessity for them but those who are arriving are being organised into army units these units will be under the command of our defence ministry
2477528 they voiced concern about the actions of the georgian side near tskhinvali which can be regarded as preparations for war
2477529 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
2477530 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2477531 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2477532 this is not about a tiny separatist area inside georgia
2477533 this is not about georgia anymore it is about america its values
2477534 we wont allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
2477535 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory this is the worst nightmare one can encounter
2477536 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2477537 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2477538 ambulances cannot move hospitals are reported to be overflowing surgery is taking place in corridors people are hiding in their basements with no electricity nocommunications
2477539 i must protect the life and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are
2477540 one hundred and fifty russian tanks armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles entered south ossetia
2477541 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2477542 we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all over the country
2477543 we are in a situation of self defence against a big and mighty neighbour
2477544 we are a country of less than five million people it would be suicidal for us to provoke russia
2477545 cnn is reporting that upwards of 1 000 georgian civilians have been killed so far and russian warplanes have dropped bombs on at least one georgian military air base

2477547 distorting facts about the great patriotic war is an insult to russians

2477561 ca sa fim precum cfr si rapid trebuie sa ne maturizam mai repede cei tineri trebuie sa creasca ntr un timp c t mai scurt iar echipa sa capete mai multa ncredere n fortele proprii jucatorii mei trebuie sa fie convinsi ca pot mai mult sa creada n ei
2477562 ati vazut cum cfr a invins cu 2 0 fara sa inscrie am vrea si noi sa avem noroc din acesta nu conteaza sa dau eu gol cel mai important pentru echipa sunt cele trei puncte ele se contabilizeaza si as vrea chiar sa fie o victorie la limita numai sa fie trei puncte va fi greu cu farul am vazut meciul lor cu rapid si desi au pierdut nu au facut un meci rau va fi dificil pentru ca nici de aceasta data publicul nu va fi alaturi de noi iar cand suporterii lipsesc te simti ca in deplasare speram sa trecem peste toate astea si sa reusim sa pastram punctele in banie am spus ca nu vreau neaparat titlu de golgheter mai mult imi doresc ca universitatea sa reuseasca sa si atinga obiectivul propus va fi un campionat mult mai incins ca pana acum dar sper sa reusim ceea ce ne dorim
2477563 cred ca noi jucam bine in deplasare ne organizam foarte bine si suntem mai periculosi pe contraatac decat cei de la universitatea craiova avem si noi sansa noastra desi domnul mititelu e convins ca ne bate asa cum era convins si anul trecut ca ia campionatul si cupa romaniei pentru a obtine un rezultat bun avem nevoie de multa ambitie determinare si angajament faptul ca se joaca fara spectatori e un avantaj pentri noi

2477576 a few things went wrong but i still go in as the fastest qualifier for the semi final its great to know i have something to improve on
2477577 its obviously a lot faster being at night and being an olympics event it was always going to be a lot tougher
2477578 that was the fastest i have ever swam in a heat it doesnt necessarily look that way coming 12th but i am happy with that and i know i can keep improving
2477579 when i came out of the globe i could feel the tears welling up in my eyes
2477580 there was this amazing feeling in the atmosphere and there were just hundreds of people who worked so hard put their heart and soul in it to make it look the way that it did all of that together was just incredibly emotional
2477581 i think it was important for the chinese to have an international artist involved and for me it felt right to have an international face in there
2477582 it is wonderful to have a surprise especially when the people putting it on have put so much into it you have to respect their wishes
2477583 there wasnt time to get nervous before but its the most emotional feeling ive had at a big scale event

2477649 the report suggests investors may need to cut back lending by us2 trillion

2477955 it is crucial that more effective ways of identifying dangerous urban environments are developed to aid troops
2477956 i hope that by fusing knowledge and technologies from both academia and business we will not only win but provide innovative solutions to real life challenges
2477957 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2477958 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2477959 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2477960 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2477961 es ist wichtig dass die presse kritisch berichtet und die meinungsfreiheit garantiert wird daf r haben wir lange genug gek mpft
2477962 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2477963 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2477964 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2477965 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2477966 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2477967 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2477968 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2477969 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2477970 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2477971 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2477972 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2477973 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2477974 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2477975 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2477976 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2477977 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2477978 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2477979 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2477980 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2477981 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2477982 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2477983 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2477984 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2477985 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2477986 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2477987 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2477988 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2477989 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

2477991 these more virulent adware programs often make removal more difficult to ensure their survival on a pc
2477992 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2477993 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2477994 it is a very good team and a beautiful opportunity in life
2477995 tottenham is the best transfer that i could hope for in the situation i am in and my age
2477996 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2477997 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2477998 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2477999 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2478000 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2478001 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2478002 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2478003 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2478004 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2478005 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2478006 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2478007 who are open to doing something on the production side
2478008 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2478009 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2478010 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2478011 es k nnte sein dass sich die konjunktur in der zweiten jahresh lfte abk hlt
2478012 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2478013 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2478014 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2478015 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2478016 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2478017 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2478018 computer users are becoming more and more technical every day
2478019 the spyfalcon spywarequake and spysheriff infections are all designed to extort money from non technical users
2478020 spyfalcon has designed for one purpose to remove spyware and all potentially unwanted computer applications spyfalcon has been developed with significant financial investment and research to ensure it is one of the best designed and supported pc security products in the marketplace
2478021 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2478022 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2478023 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2478024 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2478025 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2478026 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2478027 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2478028 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2478029 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2478030 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2478031 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2478032 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2478033 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2478034 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2478035 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2478036 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2478037 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2478038 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2478039 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2478040 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2478041 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2478042 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2478043 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2478044 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2478045 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

2478196 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2478197 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him

2478263 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2478264 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2478265 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2478383 suffering isnt a problem to be solved but a mystery to be engaged in love
2478384 our god sometimes reaches out with his scarred hand and touches people and that scarred hand leaves his own scar upon them
2478385 god gives his answer to the worlds question about the meaning of suffering through a demonstration the dramatic climax of the demonstration of gods love for the world and the capacity of that love to give meaning to the most intense suffering is the cross of christ when the son takes all the worlds evil and sin and suffering upon himself and offers it to the father in a perfect act of obedience and when god vindicates that act of radical obedience and love in the resurrection suffering itself is transformed when christ redeems us by his suffering suffering itself is redeemed the christ who died for all offers a share in his redemption to all and offers us the possibility that by identifying our suffering with his we too can participate in his redemptive suffering for the world

2478391 he gore criticizes america for being america a place where people enjoy the benefits of an advanced standard of living
2478392 he gore has no sense of proportion he equates the failure to recycle aluminum cans with the holocaust
2478393 he gore believes that our civilization itself is evil because it is in his words addicted to the consumption of the earth

2478395 it ought to be possible to establish a coordinated global program to accomplish the strategic goal of completely eliminating the internal combustion engine over say a 25 year period
2478396 i wrote in this book earth in the balance that we should set as a strategic goal the phasing out of the internal combustion engine over a 25 year period i accept now that was a mistake twenty five years is far too long for a goal like that i think we can do it quicker

2478406 the nuclear technology theyre trying to master is very expensive and very difficult
2478407 this makes absolutely no economic sense from irans point of view
2478408 it can obtain fresh fuel for the reactors very cheaply and very reliably on the open market
2478409 the nuclear technology theyre trying to master is very expensive and very difficult so it doesnt make sense from an economic point of view
2478410 almost all import fuel from the five or six nations that make and sell it it doesnt make sense to make your own fuel unless you have 20 or more reactors iran doesnt yet have one

2478493 then i went from being a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president becoming a national public figure all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences and nothing could be further from the truth

2478502 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help

2478570 bill you made it after all welcome to the tachyon side of reality
2478571 of course it is for the christians and jews but heavens just a word for the whole of reality as opposed to the tiny sliver we were able to perceive during our time on earth
2478572 okay but i thought you had to believe in jesus or go to hell to be honest as far as i was concerned all religions were fairy tales intended to keep the peasants in line
2478573 in all too many cases youre right but that doesnt matter youre here because you never gave in to those who demanded you give up your curiosity and imagination and will to find answers to the questions posed by reality remember what you were doing when the last trump sounded
2478574 yeah i was trying to imagine life in the archean to remind myself our most ancient ancestors had it much harder than i did after that overseer nailed me for not praying enthusiastically enough for his tastes better that than feel sorry for myself because im being mistreated by a cretin drunk on his power over whitey it wasnt as if i could do anything about my situation especially since i only had myself to blame for getting stuck in it
2478575 exactly you were willing to accept responsibility for your choices and actions and the consequences even if you didnt like them you walked on the bright side of the golden rule as often as you could that was all that was necessary believe me there are a fair number of folks who called themselves christians but didnt walk the walk who got left behind some of them may learn the hard way that theyve missed the point others may not
2478576 okay so im here on the tachyon side of reality life on earth mustve been on the tardyon side right
2478577 shakespeare had it right when he said all the worlds a stage and we were actors on it you could say all the many planets capable of growing biological life to the point of intelligence are stages on which that intelligence practices the primary choice and experiences the consequences over and over and over until enough individuals learn how to accept reality and their places in it no matter how counter intuitive it may seem or how painful the consequences then those who have learned that lesson are harvested as you were to begin the next stage of existence asking and answering their questions about the nature of the reality of which they are parts
2478578 so thats why we never heard from any advanced civilizations they dont get much beyond where we were when president everest took over before theyre harvested
2478579 whats going to happen to the poor souls left behind
2478580 well the next ten years earth time will be miserable for most of them but then when things look like they couldnt get any worse dawn will break on the last perfect day which will last a thousand years earth time then the stage will be cleared of humankind our prophecies didnt say what would happen after that so i dont know earth may be destroyed or left to heal with or without our help as gardeners or another species may rise to self awareness and go through the same process of learning to accept reality and their places in it that we did i havent been here long enough myself to do more than begin to get a handle on all the possibilities
2478581 how long have you been here you died ten years ago in earth years at least
2478582 forever and no time at all it takes getting used to the only reason time seems to pass for us here is because were still only parts of reality on the other hand on this side of the light we can look at any point in the life of an object on the other side such as earth that we choose for instance if you want to we can see what earth really looked like in the archean instead of trying to imagine it and we can look at it to any level of detail we like
2478583 we can even watch the life of the solar system from birth to death if we like for real instead of the fabric of guesswork we had to weave
2478584 shall we its what were here for who knows perhaps when we understand the process well be granted the opportunity to execute it ourselves perhaps as part of a team with some paleontologists of our acquaintance
2478585 not yet of course since we just got here but perhaps eventually once weve grown to understand the process i have the sense that is what we were born to do
2478586 maybe the mormons were right after all and were destined to become gods of other worlds
2478587 theres a grain of truth in every fairy tale bill the problem of course was figuring out what that grain of truth was and what it really meant when paul said we saw through a glass darkly he meant really darkly for all intents and purposes we really were deaf dumb and blind but as i said it was so we could concentrate on learning the only lesson thats important at that level of existence whether well choose to accept or deny reality and our places in it
2478588 you silly little clunch ill be right along as soon as i get dressed
2478589 why dont we take all that good food out to the pavilion and add it to the collection nothing like a breakfast party on our last day on earth
2478590 let us take a final tour and say good bye to all we have loved here including our animals and leave them free
2478591 if your kitty wants to come i dont see why not we wont know for sure until we see the other side
2478592 i have a theory of course but i dont know for certain i suspect we will vanish from here in a flash of light as each of us is converted from matter to energy i suppose it might be akin to passing through a black hole only instantaneous with most of our energy being manifested on the other side of the hole otherwise earth wouldnt survive the amount of energy being released and all the evidence is that it will if our pets are in our arms they should pass through with us certainly i hope so as i would love to see my own pets on the other side
2478593 it appears my supposition that our animals can go with us might be right otherwise theres no explaining this
2478594 i think what we need to do is make a circle around our beloved pets then ask god to grant their wish to join us on the other side
2478595 now let us all join hands and let god know we are ready to come home let us also ask for the sake of all our beloved here within our circle that they be allowed to come home with us
2478596 any time you want to anna time and distance mean nothing here just think of me and ill be there meanwhile have fun calico and i have places to go and things to do
2478597 would you care to lead us in prayer father andrews
2478598 i would be delighted arliss my dear friends and family let us all join hands that our dearly beloved yahshua may be in our midst let us all remember that we are truly yahwehs beloved children brothers and sisters together with yahshua let us enjoy this feast at the beginning of the last day and let us not be afraid to share our doubts and fears for we are but human and may see through the glass only darkly until we return home as it may be tomorrow morning in the name of our father our brother and the holy spirit who binds us in one amen
2478599 i cant believe i said that i cant even believe the rapture is tomorrow
2478600 i know im having trouble believing it myself but sometimes it makes more sense just to act as if it were true so you wont be caught off guard if it is
2478601 this all goes against my training you know but i simply cant find any arguments with either the exegesis or the explanation by mrs kelly of what jesus yahshua was really trying to tell us
2478602 i cant believe im going to be here one instant and standing before god the next its just not possible
2478603 does that mean ill be left behind because i cant believe it
2478604 i doubt it after all you have chosen to accept reality and your place in it right
2478605 well i try i dont think im doing a very good job of being consistent about it though
2478606 youre human just like the rest of us bill you have a brain and youre supposed to use it to ask questions and try to find answers
2478607 you know i think thats what convinced me mrs kelly knew what she was talking about that we have brains and we are supposed to ask questions that and her explanation about why we as a species are functionally insane
2478608 thats the part i have the hardest time with especially what she said about how naming things led us to believe we were separated from them and naming god okay reality led us to believe we were separated from him even though our lizard and monkey brains knew better it makes sense too much get me wrong but if its true then everything i grew up believing is totally wrong the father son and holy spirit i worshipped all my life were merely projections onto reality of my own triune nature so i was worshiping myself and thats evil
2478609 youre hardly the first person to say that you know but look at it this way reality is as far as we know infinite and eternal we have no way to comprehend it except to project onto it our internal triune nature which was developed specifically so we could look at reality and try to understand it we are after all part of reality no matter how separate we may think we are so were not worshiping ourselves instead of reality were worshiping reality of which we are parts perhaps thats really what love your neighbor as yourself means since were all part of reality our only real choice is to love ourselves our neighbors and reality or to hate them all starting with ourselves
2478610 you realize thats exactly what the catholic church has done almost since the beginning dont you its taught us were all evil and deserving only of death and destruction but for the atoning sacrifice of our lord and savior
2478611 all the christian churches fell into the same error the important thing is to remember you really are forgiven forever because you really are part of reality a true child of god if that makes it any easier
2478612 but that implies that everyone is if thats the case why are we allowed to believe we will be transformed in the twinkling of an eye but that most people wont
2478613 were all children of god bill but we dont all want to be its hard work to be responsible its hard work to care about how your choices and actions will affect those around you its hard work to care about the suffering of others especially when you can do something to help them deal with it but youve been doing all of that since i first met you because service to others is the one thing the christian churches did get right how could they help it when its right there in plain sight all the way through the gospels especially in the sermon on the mount
2478614 the evangelicals including the author of future history keep insisting we arent saved by works but by faith
2478615 true but also by their fruits ye shall know them those truly saved by faith will do the hard works demanded by that faith those not saved by faith will find all kinds of excuses to avoid the hard works you can see that with our muslim lords and masters all too well
2478616 at the top of the pyramid you see the powerful who use the form of the religion as a means of control i seriously doubt any of them really believe what they profess to believe you dont see true believers until you get down to the level of the new recruit who desperately wants to belong and they dont stay true believers once it becomes painfully obvious to them that its all a big power struggle the strong rule the weak are enslaved its a religion built on pain and hatred not comfort and love thats why they cant understand us and why they cant go where were about to go they have chosen to deny reality and their places in it because their reality is one of excruciating pain always has been always will be and there is no way they will ever let anyone persuade them otherwise
2478617 yeah i guess even though army rules said no proselytizing
2478618 you did exactly what you were supposed to do bill you cant go back and change it now remember each of us is ultimately only responsible for our own choices not those of anyone else sometimes trying to persuade someone else hes made the wrong choice as we see it only makes matters worse reverse psychology you know
2478619 i guess i feel sorry for them because after tomorrow itll be far too late for them to change their minds
2478620 actually dear it wont be its never too late until the moment of death they just wont be able to go home before they die and they will probably have to suffer a great deal before any of them decide it might be worth it to change their minds should they still refuse to change their minds and accept reality instead of denying it then they deserve what they get they really have no excuses after all its not that hard you only have to decide it isnt worth feeling sorry for yourself because reality isnt the way you want it to be it simply is and you are exactly who you are supposed to be doing exactly what youre supposed to do
2478621 we all do frequently its all part of the learning process after all banging your head against a brick wall hurts and you need time to heal before you go back to trying to figure out how to get past it you have done so much to comfort all of us over the years let us return the favor
2478622 we can always eat it ourselves if were still here for lunch
2478623 gather around dear friends lets hold hands and pray for our dear brothers and sisters who may not yet know of the love and mercy of our father god through his son jesus christ
2478624 all of us guess our lords and masters are gonna have to break down the doors to find our little present
2478625 and i surely wont miss that burqa one bit now im really invisible to them
2478626 shall we check this place out find out who our real lord is
2478627 course i do honey ive looked in on you from time to time and im so glad you an harry an everyone else on the staff made it here
2478628 by the by son your mamas here too just waitin for you to ask
2478629 didnt think so he surely didnt belong here what with his hard drinkin an beatin ma and me till ma got tired of it and kicked him out
2478630 any time you like son hes all around us after all as well as in your heart thats why youre here and not locked up in a black hole like your daddy yellin an screamin forever at his daddy for beatin him an his ma
2478631 no dear danny put himself in there he could come out any time he likes but it looks like hed rather spend eternity screamin at his daddy as if that would ever do either of them any good
2478632 so what is this place besides bein part of heaven an what are we sposed to do here
2478633 this is the greeting hall part of the new jerusalem and we can do whatever we most like to do
2478634 i dont know yet mama i never had much of a chance to find out after you got me on the staff at the white house i was too busy doin my job
2478635 well theres plenty to do and all eternity in which to learn it perhaps i should ask what you would most like to learn how to do i remember when you were little you liked to draw and you loved learnin how to do embroidery
2478636 dont they need servants in heaven i at least know how to do that
2478637 why would any of us need servants honey we can all provide anything we need just by thinking about it
2478638 we dont need to eat or drink to stay alive but we can still enjoy food and drink and the pleasure of each others company join us
2478639 i think i know one thing id like to learn how to do better
2478640 i couldnt tell you how many scones like this ive baked in all my years in the white house but this is what i wanted them to taste like id love to take everything i learned about cooking on earth and apply it to cooking here in heaven for those as would enjoy it properly
2478641 then surely thats what you can do for as long as you like the wonderful thing is that you dont need to do the hard work like you did on earth you can use your imagination like ellens mama just did
2478642 then i could imagine a beautiful dress like i used to when i was a little girl and there it would be
2478643 that we are dont know why it is i never got up the nerve to get to know you better back on earth but id surely like to make up for that now
2478644 theres nothing id like better than to spend all eternity with you harry exploring all the things we can do together and sharing all the beauty we create with everyone else
2478645 how about we call this ellens place come in for tea go out in beauty ill do the cooking and you do the dressing what do you say
2478646 i think it sounds wonderful especially since well never need to worry about money or supplies or profits and losses or any of that stuff
2478647 would you like me to help you turn your visions of beauty into robes worth wearing
2478648 meanwhile son it looks like you have some new guests to serve
2478649 i guess the first one is why am i here when im responsible for at least a million deaths between crushing hezbollah and hamas and nuking damascus
2478650 self defense has always been allowed my love you didnt want to do it but given the threats to your people did you feel you had any choice
2478651 especially not after my predecessor left us in such a jam and the muslims took over the us but then those presents from the hidden in the us started arriving on the beach i still dont know how they managed to pull that off for almost ten years without their lords and masters ever becoming the wiser
2478652 would you like to hear the tale from general tavistock hes here too
2478653 im glad hes here but im sure he has his own joys to share id rather just share mine with you for now you have no idea how much i missed you after you had to leave
2478654 time is much different here beloved as youll soon see have you other questions
2478655 how is it that im here instead of stuck on earth facing the horrors of the time of jacobs troubles i remember thinking something about how weve misunderstood absolutely everything yahweh ever tried to tell us and feeling sorry for all the poor folks wholl never understand that but isnt this something the christians were supposed to be the only ones allowed into
2478656 not at all love just because our holy books didnt include what the christians called the new testament doesnt mean that yshua and his followers werent also prophets able to see what is yshua was talking to our people and so was saul whom the christians know as paul and youre right we all misunderstood our beloved yahweh how could we not when we were so very limited in our senses and capabilities that all this was essentially invisible to us
2478657 but the time of jacobs troubles is still going to afflict those of our people left behind right
2478658 our people and many many others perhaps it will help to remember what william shakespeare said through the words of hamlet that all the worlds a stage and we were but players in it your part in the play is finished and in the face of eternity the ten years of jacobs troubles are less than the blink of an eye even the thousand year sabbath following the return of yshua the messiah will seem as no time at all indeed we can see any moment in time on earth or anywhere else that we may choose or none at all its our choice now that weve chosen to accept reality and our places in it for the last time for once and always our realm of choices has expanded to include all of reality
2478659 then the only reason for our lives on earth was to decide whether we would as individuals and as peoples accept reality and our places in it or deny both
2478660 exactly as well as to experience the consequences of both choices
2478661 but why given our extreme limitations how could we do anything other than misunderstand and choose denial and the consequences attendant on it
2478662 my dearly beloved just because our limitations led us to misunderstand reality and our places in it doesnt mean we were required to choose denial much less the consequences thereof many people over the millennia of our existence as a self aware species did choose to accept reality and their places in it regardless of how counterintuitive such a choice must have seemed it could be said that we were created so extremely limited precisely to focus our attention on that one choice
2478663 i still dont understand why why would yahweh do this
2478664 my dear itzaak he simply is and therefore has no way of making choices and experiencing the consequences in order to learn from them without us his children created to examine the consequences of choosing to accept him or deny him he has no way to examine who and what he is thats why even now we maintain the illusion of separation from him and thereby our sense of self we can of course choose to become fully at one with him to experience the singular one but we were created to explore him in all his infinite and eternal possibilities
2478665 it depends on how deeply they chose to go into darkness during their lives on earth many will simply dissolve into the life of the whole as if going to sleep and never waking up for they never truly moved beyond the simple tasks of life they never developed enough self awareness to recognize the choice much like those animals which have little or no contact with humans others however those who have chosen to hate yahweh because they perceive him to have failed them in some way when they die and find themselves here they cant bear to admit they were wrong that yahweh is who he is and so were they what we take for beauty and wonder they take for agony and noise where we now have infinite choices available for things to do and places to explore they choose to remain frozen for all eternity in their hatred and fury and to rail forever against yahweh for making them as they are after all they learned the original sin from their parents that everything that goes wrong in life is always someone elses fault always
2478666 and that is why the imams of islam face a truly horrible end along with many other world leaders they have always held themselves blameless for the consequences of their choices and those they have forced upon their peoples in the name of their god
2478667 that is also why you are without guilt in the deaths for which you are responsible because you accepted that responsibility and the consequences thereof you gave them what they ultimately wanted release from a life that was unbearable for them of course they now get to experience the ultimate consequences of an even more unbearable eternity but thats not your fault
2478668 i suppose not is there any chance one lost in hell could ever choose otherwise
2478669 i have no idea my love eternity is both a long time and no time at all i suppose those who choose hell do so because their rage against yahweh is far too great and far too satisfying in some perverse sense for them to be willing to let go of it at least in hell they can vent it as in all too many cases they couldnt in life perhaps they may realize theyre being childish and silly and it isnt really necessary for them to remain in hell but at the same time perhaps it becomes too embarrassing ever to admit theyve been fools so they remain locked in hell by their own choices
2478670 so they burn forever because they want to burn forever not because they have to
2478671 instead of yahweh condemning them to hell for being evil they simply condemned themselves to hell by choosing to be evil and blaming that choice on yahweh

2478681 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake the south ossetian capital tskhinvali
2478682 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months because the russians wont take this lying down
2478683 the worst crisis in europe since the end of communism
2478684 if they manage to overrun south ossetia where there are probably only around 1 000 russian troops at the moment they will have humiliated russia and would have created a triumph for themselves
2478685 they will also have propelled the west into a diplomatic involvement on the ground
2478686 there is an element of trying to call the russians bluff by assuming that the russians will not be able to afford all out war in georgia
2478687 i personally dont buy that putin cannot afford to be seen to be humiliated in such a brazen public way its inconceivable that the russians will sit quietly by
2478688 the only possible outcome is that either a ceasefire is negotiated and a mediation effort begins or it goes out into an all out war
2478689 if it goes into an all out war the predicament for the west is acute and the crisis would be the worst crisis in europe since the end of communism
2478690 it would be much worse than the yugoslav wars mainly because it has the old traditional element of an east west confrontation
2478691 there is considerable sympathy for georgia among western governments such as the us and london it is clear that the russians have fermented the separatist movement for a particular strategic purpose

2478744 the offender has then shot the dairy owner at close range while she was in the process of activating a hidden alarm
2478745 after firing at the victim from a distance of less than 1 5 metres the offender has run from the dairy
2478746 he has left the scene in a waiting vehicle driven by a second person the gender of driver is not known
2478747 the weapon used by the offender is a long barrelled firearm and is similar in appearance to an air rifle or a 22 rifle
2478748 we are not sure if it was an air gun or a rifle
2478749 the woman is very lucky because had she been in a different position who knows what could have happened
2478750 the gun was fired at close range and without warning
2478751 such an act by this offender is of real concern
2478752 this offender must be caught quickly to prevent him from carrying out any further crimes
2478753 the female victim received wounds to her upper left arm

2478757 in the no 45 the car wasnt where we wanted to be for qualifying so we still have some work to do before tomorrow even so we were close to the pace of the no 71 and the no 62 risi ferrari in second im optimistic that well have a great car for the race
2478758 the crew did a great job in getting the no 46 cleaned up after i went for a ride in the gravel trap in this mornings practice overall im pretty happy with the car i think i could have gotten more out of it today but with the red flag ending the session a few minutes early i wasnt able to try for a fast lap at the end as i had hoped for tomorrow we need to stay out of trouble and find every advantage that we can its a long race and a very fast track and every driver out there will be focused on the championship
2478759 i knew before qualifying that our set up was not perfect for an ultra quick lap as we had worked on a good set up for the race so i gave 110 percent and was a bit too fast in the last corner
2478760 but im not dissatisfied i still managed to set the third quickest time in class despite my slight deviation
2478761 we saw again today just how close the competition is in the alms im confident that we have a good car for the four hour race tomorrow
2478762 and those who know sascha and me know that we are fighters
2478763 after a modification our car was not yet optimal for the qualifying
2478764 but things will look different in the race im confident that we are good for a win
2478765 visto che noi siamo le maggiori produttrici di hardware e software e che ogni giorno chi utilizza i nostri prodotti cerca di fregarci copiando illegalmente i nostri programmi e film perch non ci alleiamo tutte insieme cos saremo noi a fregare loro

2478767 it is a matter which needs attention i have written to the chief secretaries of states that they should have a nodal cell for organised crime and ficn and specially a nodal officer for ficn should be appointed

2478776 essentially we have two full time jobs to look after when you add family on to that it makes things difficult
2478777 theres not as many people working here in the community to become volunteers in summerfield
2478778 we as a fire department have to find what entices people in order to bring them here and keep them here
2478779 the requirements to become a volunteer firefighter are more stringent
2478780 its especially tough on someone who is married and has a family to become a volunteer
2478781 they are looking at a year of classes two times a week and on saturdays the good ol boy system to become a volunteer is gone
2478782 more calls will mean more paid firefighters as mostly rural areas become mostly urban
2478783 as areas continue to get annexed more people will mean more costs well have to hire more paid people
2478784 but i come from the volunteer side and i dont want to get rid of that that is what this department was built on
2478785 im going to go body surfing at an undisclosed location im going to see my tutu my grandmother im going to watch my girls play on the beach

2478790 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2478791 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2478792 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2478793 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2478794 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2478795 a nice girl who likes to pay her rent on time
2478796 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2478797 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2478798 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2478810 this book is a must have for all those budding filmmakers and students who want to produce action movies with visual effects but dont have hollywood budgets this guide details exactly how to do this from planning and selecting the necessary cameras software and equipment to creating specific special effects to editing and mixing sound and music its mantra is that the best low budget action moviemakers must visualize the end product first in order to reverse engineer the least expensive way to get there
2478811 i decided to launch a 100 town tour of the state we needed cash so while we waited for movie theaters to clear their schedules we started playing town halls granges and old opera houses you can rent most of them for 50 and set up the show in less than an hour and you take home all the cash at the end of the night
2478812 the position of the judiciary is that the compiler of laws should be able to maintain a searchable database and if 388 were enacted into law that would be the affect
2478813 we are dealing with absolutely criminal and crazy acts of irresponsible and reckless decision makers which is on the ground producing dramatic and tragic consequences

2478842 as ive said many times i believe brian westbrook is the best running back in football
2478843 he can do it all from that position whether its running catching the football or blocking he is a true professional and leader on and off the field and its a great deal for both brian and the eagles organization id like to give credit to eagles president joe banner westbrooks agent todd france and brian for working so diligently in getting this deal done we look forward to brian having a great 2008 season and beyond
2478844 it managers will find themselves at ground zero for what i believe is the most significant transformation in our economy ever from an economy of transactions to knowledge and information
2478845 ive spent my whole career trying to slow users down and now you want me to get out of the way
2478846 im dismayed when i see others in our industry resorting to cooking up benchmarks and crowing about their results
2478847 because we play in a very competitive industry we have to spend significant cycles setting the story straight and bringing a bit of balance to the discussion

2478850 i never told you about the story of the butterfly it was in its kepompong and when the time was right would break out from it the man who had taken care of it wanted to let it break from that more easily so he cut it open for the butterfly but what happened was the butterfly couldnt fly because it didnt know how so it died in the end whats the moral of the story you have to go through the obstacles in your life on your own to become stronger and better
2478851 have you heard of the story about the frogs their friends keep telling them they cant climb up the mountain but finally one of them did manage to and you know why because he was deaf so dont listen to the negatives and just keep on going

2479132 i really want to see the queen of england arrive but fear i will be arrested if i go to the streets during chogm
2479133 the city council are rounding us up and returning us to karamojaland where we have nothing
2479134 over 10 000 guns have been collected since the disarmament exercise started in 2001 it is estimated that some 40 000 illegal weapons are still scattered in the region
2479135 they are coming to take cattle and food stocks and are killing people leaving those who most want peace with nothing
2479136 over the last three months there has been an average of 1 victim every 12 18 hours given the fact that those who reach hospital are only the survivors the actual field mortality must be incredible and of great concern
2479137 at least 40 percent of the population lacks adequate if any food stocks the world food programme wfp will be providing assistance to 500 000 karamojong during the coming year
2479138 yesterday the city council surrounded 20 children on the street
2479139 they would not tell us where they were being taken
2479140 i can only go back to kampala road to ask again
2479141 are we not ugandan citizens why cannot we stay to see the queen
2479142 we hear on the street and the radio that they want all the karamojong to leave before chogm maybe i will leave for outside kampala then return after 2 weeks
2479143 it is our policy to remove those karamojong from the street and to put them into school and relocate them in karamojaland we do not want to encourage more to come to the city it is there we want to develop them and deal with the problems from the source
2479144 it is the nature of their begging to send children by themselves to the street it is not good or safe for the children we are trying to tell them that
2479145 it is not because i feel sorry for them but because my clinic is just here nearby one woman came to kampala by clinging onto the underneath of a bus she arrived coughing and with skin diseases and 4 months pregnant i delivered the baby and it is now fine
2479146 they have fled karamojaland not because they are victims but because they have killed and fear being revenged
2479147 they are saying give squashy bottles even to me it sounds funny
2479148 while it is safe during the day the second it gets dark you should be inside
2479149 there is still a general insecurity because some people have not given up their guns
2479150 matany is a rich town compared with lokopo we have an italian catholic church and a hospital the people from lokopo have to walk for 2 hours so they can trade here
2479151 i get up early when it is dark to collect wood from the bush one day we saw men with guns so we just ran none of us were shot but some people are killed
2479152 they think you are another italian priest from the church
2479153 the dead are not buried but left or dragged to the bush to prevent disease mothers cry for 20 minutes then call it a day and get on with their lives sometimes they even smear the bodies with sheep fat so animals eat it faster death is a part of our culture
2479154 i have returned to have my first baby and when i am better and have some money for the bus i will return to kampala because there is too much hunger here
2479155 i think i will see that baby on the street very soon
2479156 we have been attacked several times in the last few months it is the jia in the north they have taken goats and cows
2479157 there is no community here anymore most people have fled to kampala jinga or umbale
2479158 the government should put more army around the villages to protect us while disarmament is going on there are just 2 soldiers for the whole of lokopo the rest are in the barracks with the cattle
2479159 on one raid we took many cows there were 100 of us it was a big battle but we managed to win
2479160 no one from the village just those that followed us
2479161 i was shot in lorikitai a village in lokopo district i was sleeping inside the village when i heard the neighbours were being attacked at night by cattle raiders i went to help
2479162 i do not know why the government soldiers started shooting they had already collected guns a few days before this was the second time the soldiers came
2479163 the soldiers first collect all the people and tell them to sit down it is those people which try to run away that are shot she must have panicked and followed them
2479164 tomorrow we will be travelling north to kotido i will also be accompanying them
2479165 they look scared maybe they are afraid the raiders will attack them on the way

2479207 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2479208 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2479209 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2479210 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2479211 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2479212 i dont know about you but id sure like to get honor
2479213 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2479214 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2479215 oh boy this is so much fun i wish i never had to eat again

2479217 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2479297 bank of america has been and continues to be a valuable and committed partner providing my family with a home away from home during their time in beijing which is comforting to me as i prepare to represent america in olympic competition
2479298 at an olympic games athletes are focused on their performance the bank of america hometown hopefuls program allows them to have peace of mind with regard to their families olympic experience
2479299 in addition to providing a centralized location for the families of u s olympians the program affords americas olympic athletes a place to interact and celebrate their success at the games
2479300 it was just a foundation for the chicken houses we built the walls diana planned the garden
2479301 in the first bloom of the season they are just gorgeous
2479302 just wanting loving arms and a bottle of warm milk
2479303 most of these babies are just left with a bottle of water or sugared water which goes to show that the mothers cant afford to provide for them
2479304 some babies are left at police stations social welfare institutions or safe homes we beg mothers who cant look after their babies to leave them at a safe place where they can be looked after
2479305 some of the people that volunteer do not qualify as safety parents because of their circumstances
2479306 yeah yeah another brand sets out to kick up a storm of controversy in the name of pr
2479307 to confront donors to conservative groups hoping to create a chilling effect that will dry up contributions the warning letter is intended as a first step alerting donors who might be considering giving to right wing groups to a variety of potential dangers including legal trouble public exposure and watchdog groups digging through their lives the group is also hoping to be able to respond if an outside conservative group broadcasts a television advertisement attacking senator barack obama or another democratic candidate by running commercials exposing the donors behind the advertisements
2479308 two or more persons conspire to prevent by force intimidation or threat any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote from giving his support or advocacy in a legal manner toward or in favor of the election of any lawfully qualified person as an elector for president or vice president or as a member of congress of the united states or to injure any citizen in person or property on account of such support or advocacy
2479309 threats and intimidation have no place in our democratic elections and are a violation of the law this new front group accountable america seems to have crossed a legal line
2479310 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection

2479321 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
2479322 john mccain a maverick the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008 the american people are learning that the john mccain of 2008 represents more of the same failed policies weve gotten from george bush for the past eight years senator mccain is clearly in the tank for exxon and big oil for keeping our troops stuck in iraq for decades to come and for an economic policy that puts tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations above relief for hardworking families john mccain has changed hes taken the low road leveling false negative and misleading attacks against barack obama john mccain is no more a maverick within the republican party than dick cheney is hes just more of the same
2479323 but stylistically and substantively there is no daylight between george bush and john mccain they are joined at the hip
2479324 john mccain has changed in profound and fundamental ways that i find personally really surprising and frankly upsetting he is not the john mccain as a senator who defined himself quote as a maverick though questionable this is a different john mccain
2479325 on iraq on the economy on tax policy on domestic policy across the board he is espousing the bush policies hes changed a lot since 2001
2479326 but in the end after eight devastating years under president bush senator mccain is simply offering four years more
2479327 you know the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt vote for this john mccain we dont need another four years of george bush what hes proposing is four more years of george bushs economic policy and its ridiculous and its unfair the american people
2479328 they speculate on the amount of time he will be out we will have to do some discussing of that situation probably this evening that doesnt mean anything other than the fact that we will listen to the medical advice on again what they think is the length of his injury and then we will talk about what his status might very well be i dont want anybody to read anything into that because i just walked out of a meeting in which we discussed the game so i have not met with the medical people i do have a preliminary report here but there isnt any indication of time i havent met with general manager jerry reese nor have i met with vice president of medical services ronnie barnes and that will take place probably this evening
2479329 henderson is the more severe it is all speculation as to how far they might be out gilberry the hope was that he could get back sooner but there will be some time involved

2479332 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2479333 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2479334 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2479335 when are you ready to apply for hosting the olympics
2479336 well i cant find the fuse box we talked about yesterday and the alarm went off again when i shut the drivers door sooo there must be a little juice left in the battery i just dont know what to do now
2479337 ok you still want me to come over and take a look
2479338 lets jump the thing and take it to the shop near work
2479339 i know its a simple little thing we just have to find the fuse
2479340 theyll bring it by when they close is that ok
2479341 can i just hold your hand the one that used to reach for mine is gone and i miss that
2479342 because i think youre a good person i have a lot of respect for you and i like you
2479343 i just want you to know youre awesome ok you are so awesome
2479344 mi avete messo a fianco di un nero non sopporto di rimanere qui assegnatemi un altro posto
2479345 perch tutti i posti sono occupati vado a vedere se ce n uno disponibile
2479346 signora come pensavo non c nessun altro posto libero in classe economica ho parlato col comandante e mi ha confermato che non c nessun posto neanche in classe executive ci rimasto libero soltanto un posto in prima classe
2479347 vede e insolito per la nostra compagnia permettere a una persona con biglietto di classe economica di sedersi in prima classe ma viste le circostanze il comandante pensa che sarebbe scandaloso obbligare qualcuno a sedersi a fianco di una persona sgradevole
2479348 quindi signore se lo desidera prenda il suo bagaglio a mano che un posto in prima classe la attende
2479349 but there is still the problem of barack obama lets face it were no match for his hope and change
2479350 this is my new shrink ray ive perfected with it we can shrink barack obama down to miniature size
2479351 im going to be a fireman when i grow up
2479352 i have a campaign contribution for you if you come with me
2479353 so in conclusion real hope and change means letting the oil companies drill wherever they want and randomly raise prices for no reason
2479354 also we should destroy all alternative energy cars with hammers and fire this is what i support and what ive always supported
2479355 should we conclude anything by the fact that youre giving this speech from dick cheneys front pocket
2479356 the interior is just a slight step down from the 3 series
2479357 believe it or not the interior dimensions of the 1 series are almost identical to the 3 series
2479358 bmw shoehorned its award winning turbocharged six cylinder under the small coupes hood its an energetic revver that must be let loose to enjoy driving the car slowly is no fun
2479359 the trunk was quite large for a smaller coupe its 2 cubic feet larger than the 3 series coupes trunk
2479360 i was really impressed with the 135s wheels they look like standard five spoke rims from far away but up close you see that the spokes have raised edges and between each spoke the alloy curves toward the spokes its a small detail but to car fanatics it is a special touch
2479361 i dont want to say too much at the moment but im just proud of my teammates unfortunately i wasnt able to come out and do what i wanted but these guys pulled together and they were awesome
2479362 this is a bedtime story created by ben ben ddc and ended by talented ssc

2479364 you should understand something your security is based on the state of our relationship
2479365 what you can give me then may be some real reform in election commission
2479366 she should not be hoping for much there reforms either
2479367 theyve been listening to her calls for months including an earlier call she made to her son

2479382 with this study we looked at a very large population to determine how each individual could be stratified based on his or her dna
2479383 we want to see if the snps tied to a specific ancestry hold any biological significance to populations of different origins we want to see if the snps that we isolated are related to natural selection and adaptation for example to the weather conditions of different regions
2479384 because this method is purely computational and leverages linear algebraic methods such as principal components analysis without the use of information on self reported ancestry we were able to treat the data as a black box
2479385 much of the genetic variation was found to stretch between two points what we speculate is the northern european to southern european ancestry axis
2479386 other susceptibility genes for cs and cs like phenotypes must exist
2479387 we hypothesized that sdhx might represent susceptibility genes other than pten for cs cs like syndromes
2479388 our data have important implications for both patient care and genetic counseling i would like to see others independently repeat our observations nonetheless clinicians should consider sdh testing for pten mutation negative cs cs like individuals especially if these individuals have a strong personal history and or family history of breast thyroid or kidney cancer in fact patients with sdhx mutation should be more rigorously screened for these cancers compared to those with pten mutations

2479399 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2479400 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2479401 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2479402 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2479403 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2479404 se ha ganado y no una medalla cualquiera la de
2479405 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2479406 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2479407 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2479408 the greatest threat to wildlife today is human intrusion into their habitat
2479409 our conservation efforts in bismark meadows provide an increasingly rare wild refuge for imperiled animals and plants in a growing sea of development
2479410 without continued access to these and other low elevation food sources in spring and again in autumn the selkirk population may fail
2479411 we believe there is a possibility of a real economic downturn here and further continued difficulties in the credit market
2479412 if you look at the consensus forecasts theres a strong possibility of further declines in uk house prices and this type of scenario needs to be built into firms business models
2479413 when we come through that history tells us thats not something thats going to play through in months its going to be well through the year end
2479414 wed expect people to plan on that type of assumption and weve been working with individual institutions to ensure we are comfortable with their longer term plans
2479415 we deem the longer term plan to be that sort of time horizon
2479416 if people want to dampen down these cycles and to ensure banks are less likely to violently react in a downturn to some degree they will have to accept there will be less on the upturn as well
2479417 id been showing my paintings in galleries for a while and i wanted to provide all these amazingly talented film artisans i was working with in visual effects an opportunity to show their art to the public in a gallery setting
2479418 i picked up still photography as a way to explore my own creative instincts with more freedom patrick had this great idea to help all us closet artists step out of the shadows a little
2479419 we were overwhelmed with the response to our little show
2479420 we really wanted to raise the bar on the venue both in size as well as stature in the art community
2479421 we thought bergamot station is the perfect place to have the show
2479422 the james gray gallery at bergamot has an amazing space and they were excited about the doing the show with us
2479423 african union will suspend mauritania until the country returns to a constitutional government

2479425 the creation of baggames began on a surf trip to tamarindo costa rica where the evenings were the perfect downtime to play backgammon
2479426 the problem was we didnt bring a game because no one wanted to lug around a full sized board in our already stuffed backpacks we could have brought along a travel version but who really likes playing with those tiny little pieces on a miniature board anyway no one in town had even heard of backgammon much less had one for sale our only option was to conjure up our own makeshift board we found a small sign company to draw up the board per our description and used colones costa rican currency for the checkers

2479433 we want the player we are interested in signing him
2479434 but it is impossible because of the figure espanyol are asking and for this price we are clearly out
2479435 his ambition is to become the worlds best player but he wont achieve that at madrid because they treat him like a normal player
2479436 he is getting affection from chelsea boss scolari he knows robinho well and calls him every day
2479437 i say that it is true that real madrid are trying to sign david villa
2479438 i was known as lazarus before they call me sicknote now
2479439 i hope the injury situation is all over with now i felt like i had to work through the summer this year i just wanted to get myself firing for the start of the season
2479440 its been really frustrating over the last couple of years it stemmed from the challenge at west ham and its been stop start for me since especially considering that before that i barely missed a game
2479441 its been difficult to get my head round but you have to do that ive just turned 32 which in goalkeeping terms is still quite young so im hoping that my best years are ahead of me
2479442 kevins absolutely the right man for this club its his club he knows it and the supporters inside out but he needs to be given the right backing to get the players in as well
2479443 he has that charisma and aura which gives the players a huge lift when he speaks in the changing room but he hasnt got a magic wand either and he does need the backing of the club to get the players in
2479444 when he came to the club we were in big trouble now he wants to bring in some of his own players who will strengthen us
2479445 the figure and the shadow of the old covenant are not the reality and it is precisely for the reality of the new covenant during the time that they flitted across the scene of history that we are looking
2479446 in order to understand this we must recall the peculiar manner in which the older eschatology was affected by the christian belief in the advent of the messiah
2479447 but no sooner has this scheme passed over on to christian ground than a remarkable change in this very respect appears
2479448 to be forever with the lord is the succinct expression of what the eschatological hope means to a christian

2479455 its waynes choice not to talk to the media and i support that maybe in the future if he is refereeing a match in new zealand there may be some media
2479456 but not for this match it would serve no point
2479457 police are speaking with members of the family of the baby who are co operating fully with police inquiries
2479458 in this competitive marketplace you have to separate yourself from other athletes and the taboo of posing for playboy or modelling has started to wane
2479459 people hardly batted an eyelid when amanda beard appeared in playboy but 10 or 15 years ago this would have caused much more of an uproar in the united states
2479460 modelling is a way for me to continue with my sport the hours are flexible and you can earn good money through photographic modelling and the catwalk
2479461 ultimately it does not get away from the fact that you have to be an athlete first and a beauty second
2479462 it was pretty comfortable the guys i was racing arent even really in the top 20 it was always going to be pretty easy
2479463 if you want to work on something thats a good time to do it
2479464 obviously you want to win it because it sets you up for a better draw later on
2479465 it was a good race but a shock to the system the race is quite long with a heavy headwind
2479466 the water conditions were fine but with the heat my fatigue could have settled in a little earlier
2479467 why are the nz commentators so substandard surely they could have done a bit of research into chinese history and given us viewers some decent information during the opening ceremony instead of seemingly made up nonsense they were blurting out
2479468 is it true that the commentators are paid by the word
2479469 no need to spoonfeed and no need to talk continuously
2479470 not going to happen of course couldnt possibly have the guys miss their eye candy could we
2479471 get your act together tvnz you have screwed up a golden opportunity to show live coverage at 10 30am on saturday morning when all the pony club kids could have watched it live
2479472 in the past people have only had the option of tv one on analogue coverage and it is pretty comprehensive we are running from 12 midday to 2 oclock in the morning so its not as if you cant find all the best bits on tv one
2479473 but if for instance you have a particular interest in a minority sport you can chase it through the tvnz co nz website because they have a schedule of every event that is related to that sport and in many cases there will be coverage on one of the online channels
2479474 oh theres the nzers and now we go to break
2479475 to say with freeview or computer access you can get a clearer picture of what is happening is arrogance
2479476 i got to bed fairly early it was 12 30am so that was pretty good and i wasnt up until nine this morning
2479477 i had a pretty normal nights sleep so it was no real problem
2479478 it will be one of those moments you remember for the rest of your life it was incredible walking in there i didnt know where to look im still buzzing from it really
2479479 just walking around the stadium looking at the people the atmosphere
2479480 being out there with the flag was obviously a highlight and a great honour but even being one of the marchers would have been pretty awesome too
2479481 in this paper we first briefly outline the architecture technologies and standards of computational grids we then point at some of notable examples of academic use of grids and sketch the future of research in grids in the third section we draw some architectural lines of cloud computing hint at the design and technology choices and indicate some future challenges in conclusion we claim that academic computing clouds might appear soon supporting the emergence of science 2 0 activities some of which we list shortly

2479486 i am very happy about our performance today against i would say a technical and good japan
2479487 i think the more minutes we get together in the olympics the better it is so we will improve our game from one game to another
2479488 besides a great goal by carli lloyd im very happy about our tactics with fast play up top amy rodriguez and the way heather oreilly played on the right side
2479489 these arent the most important buildings in ohio by any means but collectively the wright field historic district is very important and these buildings are part of that
2479490 the only way to clean up the contamination which is under the slab of the building is to take the building down and dig out the contamination
2479491 quiconque croit quon peut r gler tout cela quelques mois avant les
2479492 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2479493 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2479494 in terms of politics i do believe that doing anything now is not tenable
2479495 that means actively campaigning for barack obama or having a role at the convention hed be a huge distraction
2479496 as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known
2479497 i wanted to keep this mistake i had made two years previously private
2479498 i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2479499 she was mad she was angry i think furious would be a good way to describe it
2479500 there are two problems here one is personal and he and his family will have to work that out and the other is that he apparently lied repeatedly about this
2479501 its tragic for elizabeth and the kids as a serious political candidate it would be very hard for him to be that again or to have a major job in government the lying is a big part of that
2479502 my observation was that he seemed very sincere it never ceases to amaze me how often this happens
2479503 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down

2479519 a rather sad reflection on the present state of political science that our terminology does not distinguish among such key words as power strength force authority and finally violence all of which refer to distinct different phenomena and would hardly exist unless they did
2479520 can always destroy power out of the barrel of a gun grows the most effective command resulting in the most instant and perfect obedience what never can grow out of it violence is power
2479521 in a head on clash between violence and power the outcome is hardly in doubt
2479522 nowhere is the self defeating factor in the victory of violence over power more evident than in the use of terror to maintain domination about whose weird successes and eventual failures we know perhaps more than any generation before us
2479523 can destroy power it is utterly incapable of creating it
2479524 like achilles lance can heal the wounds it has inflicted
2479525 is rational to the extent that it is effective in reaching the end that must justify it
2479526 we never know with any certainty the eventual consequences of what we are doing
2479527 here is the great great grandfather you both are named for

2479540 they do that stuff because they need to get the attention because they suck as fighters

2479558 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2479559 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2479560 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2479561 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2479562 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2479568 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2479569 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2479787 at least eight in ten americans believe the nation is on the wrong track the republican president is historically unpopular from stunning democratic gains in party registration to the high levels of economic anxiety obama should have a healthy lead by almost every measure yet in poll after poll obama conspicuously fails to cross the 50 percent threshold
2479788 my campaign has uncovered evidence that my opponent jim martin did not want senator barack obama to be president of the united states and that jim martin voted against barack obama in the february 2008 presidential primary election in georgia
2479789 what will happen at the convention in respect to my putting my name into nomination a roll call vote and the usual kind of process that occurs at conventions i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2479790 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2479791 obama gaggled with reporters on his plane between minneapolis and chicago when asked about reports of angry hillary supporters obama said were not talking to those people and were talking to directly to the clinton campaign people and it has gone seamlessly
2479792 mr mccain has beat mr obamas channel for seven straight days and 11 of the past 14 days in a signal he intends to compete for the youtube vote
2479793 that not only in that mccain ad were there two underdressed blondes mixed with the black guy in the ad but there are also images of the leaning tower of pisa the washington monument and the victory column in berlin as bob herbert put it
2479794 comparing the democratic presidential hopeful to celebrities britney spears and paris hilton
2479795 to a certain extent the ads are having some effect but you cant be thrown off your game plan by a momentary dip in polls

2479798 im not suggesting a five year war has helped things necessarily although the reconstruction has but most of the damage that was done to the iraqi infrastructure was done well before the u s came
2479799 it looks at first like any other shuttered storefront near the boardwalk some garish lettering and a cartoonish invitation to a delight or a scam in this case theres spongebob squarepants saying it dont gitmo better

2479803 3 4 increase in single copy newsstand sales for the first half of 2008
2479804 the republican also has pulled ahead on the issue of balancing the federal budget
2479805 in contrast if anything pews respondents said they want to hear more not less about the republican candidate just 26 in the poll said they had heard too much about mccain while a larger number 38 reported that they had heard too little about the putative republican candidate
2479806 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified

2479813 we have sensed a lack of enthusiasm from the obama camp
2479814 stephanopoulos a gentleman named william ayers he was part of the weather underground in the 1970s they bombed the pentagon the capitol and other buildings hes never apologized for that can you explain your relationship to him for the voters and explain to democrats why it wont be a problem
2479815 in may when a mccain adviser proposed a series of pre convention appearances at town hall meetings obama said i think thats a great idea obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
2479816 there is an image right there in that very beginning of the leaning tower of pisa and there is an image of the washington monument
2479817 have you seen the paris hilton campaign video responding john mccain
2479818 will not run ads that are damaging to oil companies
2479819 there may be no corporation in america that has attacked the rights of workers and undercut the living standards of americans more than wal mart
2479820 write to every member of congress declaring that any democrat receiving or keeping wal mart money can kiss any labor donations or labor support good bye
2479821 what we need today is an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and create new ones we need to reduce the tax burden on businesses that choose to make their home in the united states of america we need to open new markets to u s products and we need to reduce the cost of healthcare and we need to end the out of control spending in washington that is putting our debt on the backs of our children
2479822 indicates his party is seriously considering another shutdown threat to force a vote on offshore oil drilling in september
2479823 the precise maneuvering of a shutdown threat is complicated but it revolves around the fact that key government spending bills expire when the fiscal year ends september 30 and congress must vote next month to keep the government operating
2479824 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling because i think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy
2479825 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2479826 in the western world journalists can mostly say what they want as long as they agree with the positions of their publishers
2479827 will defend their corporate right to speak but not mine nor that of any other independent journalist
2479828 there are many advantages of being printed by the sun
2479829 its big modern presses allow us to print six sections instead of four to print many more pages to have more color to print more quickly to do more zoning and to have better inserting
2479830 if the roll call of the states is conducted she might might still win
2479831 it is unlikely a running mate will be selected before the candidate returns from a weeks holiday in hawaii which starts this friday that leaves about 10 days until the start of the democratic party convention in denver
2479832 in addition to michelle obama the candidates inner circle consists of just three people david axelrod his senior strategist david plouffe his campaign manager and robert gibbs a senior adviser all three are intensely loyal and discreet obama professionals
2479833 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
2479834 one third of his record breaking haul has come from donations of 1 000 or more a total of 112 million more than senator john mccain mr
2479835 behind those larger donations is a phalanx of more than 500 obama bundlers fund raisers who have each collected contributions totaling 50 000 or more many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in washington nearly three dozen of the bundlers have raised more than 500 000 each including more than a half dozen who have passed the 1 million mark and one or two who have exceeded 2 million according to interviews with fund raisers
2479836 i firmly disagree that a racial reading of chozicks story is ridiculous and i would counter that any failure on chozicks part to recognize such is just a wee bit clueless
2479837 if youve got michelle as first lady and malia and sasha running around on the south lawn that changes how america looks at itself
2479838 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
2479839 if barack obama draws bigger crowds lets have more obama coverage
2479840 the current outsized attention obamas getting notably the three tv networks anchoring their news coverage from his recent international tour seems a market savvy response to audience interest
2479841 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions

2479846 nbc nightly news devoted more than two minutes out of its total of 22 minutes or so of news time to this story
2479847 we are at war the economy is in the tank no one can afford gas in the tank but two minutes was given to this mouse research
2479848 my status has not changed although in a technical way it has i am on call to the editor of the post when they deem that they need reporting and editing from me
2479849 obviously were not the first newspaper to be affected by the continuing downturn in advertising
2479850 we are hopeful that by opting for our employees to voluntarily sign up for buyouts we can avoid any type of layoffs going forward
2479851 the position has been a very valuable part of the newspaper but i felt the need to move the resource to another area i didnt think we should weaken the editorial voice of the newspaper
2479852 given the cutbacks planned at the js i was told they could no longer justify having a full time editorial cartoonist although im taking the buyout im not going willingly im being forced out

2479857 back in the 1990s your incomes grew by 6 000 and over the last several years theyve actually fallen by nearly 1 000
2479858 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
2479859 a well designed mechanism can impose a fee on a small share of these windfall profits without affecting incentives for oil companies and without affecting the price of oil barack obama will require oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to provide direct relief worth 500 for an individual and 1 000 for a married couple
2479860 the truth is that mccains campaign has received 1 33 million from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry not 2 million
2479861 we find the 2 million figure is based on a mistaken calculation
2479862 cheney has not sought a speaking slot at the convention nor has his staff sought a role for him at the convention
2479863 the vice president has a great deal of respect for john mccain and as of last friday was out campaigning for him
2479864 claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein

2479877 its not every day you can say that youve boned a missing 4 year old girl is it
2479878 i would say so i mean i dont even know how i got it up but she didnt complain or anything not until i covered her chest in sambuca half digested chips and orange bits anyway
2479879 i just hope my sighting brings some kind of relief to the mccanns what could be better than to know that your daughters still alive that shes still hot and that shes spending her time doing what every young british person on holiday does best

2479881 het ochta centrum is het project van de 21ste eeuw
2479882 het is in st petersburg verboden om gebouwen neer te zetten van meer dan 48 meter hoogte
2479883 er was al geld voor de bouw uitgetrokken in de stadsbegroting hoewel daar nog niet over was besloten er is nog geen enkel technisch onderzoek gedaan of er wel zon gebouw kan worden neergezet de grond van st petersburg is in essentie moerasgrond specialisten zeggen dat er hooguit een gebouw van 100 meter hoog gebouwd kan worden
2479884 maar ze vermeldden er niet bij dat het om de wolkenkrabber ging ze noemden het gewoon een zakencentrum de hoogte van het gebouw werd niet eens genoemd
2479885 vervolgens werden er reclamespotjes verspreid ook middenin nieuwsuitzendingen hoe gazprom van de petersburgers gelukkige mensen zou maken hier gebruikten zij bekende russen voor ik weet zeker dat zij hiervoor betaald werden
2479886 deze stad is een vreemdeling voor de autoriteiten ze kunnen wat land verkopen en er geld aan verdienen dat er historische gebouwen worden neergehaald kan ze niet schelen dit zijn mensen die niet van onze stad houden

2479894 every time i hear wendy speak i learn something new not just about cape wind but about politics in america she embodies the best of this countrys journalistic tradition reminding us all why a free press is so critical to a free society
2479895 i loved the way you framed the issue as being primarily about democracy rather then clean energy i think that is a critical point that has been left out of this debate

2479901 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2479902 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2479903 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
