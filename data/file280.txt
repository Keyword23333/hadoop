2800000 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2800001 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2800002 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2800003 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2800004 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2800005 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2800006 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2800007 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2800008 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2800009 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2800010 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2800011 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2800012 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2800013 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2800014 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2800015 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2800016 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2800017 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2800018 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2800019 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2800020 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2800021 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2800022 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2800023 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2800024 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2800025 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2800026 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2800027 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2800028 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2800029 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2800030 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2800031 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2800032 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2800033 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2800034 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2800035 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2800036 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2800037 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2800038 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2800039 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2800040 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2800041 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2800042 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2800043 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2800044 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2800045 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2800046 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2800047 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2800048 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2800049 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2800050 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2800051 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2800052 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2800053 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2800054 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2800055 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2800056 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2800057 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2800058 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2800059 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2800060 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2800061 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2800062 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2800063 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2800064 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2800065 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2800066 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2800067 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2800068 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2800069 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2800070 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2800071 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2800072 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2800073 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2800074 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2800075 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2800076 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2800077 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2800078 cook them down into plum butter cut in half leaving the stones in and put in a pan with cinnamon clove a tiny touch of powdered ginger go easy and a big old glass of white wine doesnt have to be expensive add about a cup of sugar put on a low fire use a heat diffuser or put them in the crockpot and long slow simmer them until they cook down to a thick mush the mixture will darken because of the spices remove the stones put in covered glass jar in the fridge keeps for an amazingly long time as in months in the fridge
2800079 i figured that eventually you would be calling me to clean up your mess
2800080 i dont need you to clean up anything if youd like you can just hop back into your car and fly away
2800081 you dont want me to go anywhere you know you want me to stay right here

2800083 deci you really changed havent you i mean i know taking peoples lives arent anything to joke about but wasnt it you who once told me that you have to keep laughing or else it will drive you mad
2800084 look things happen and they make you open up your eyes and realize everything isnt just a fucking game
2800085 its not a game i never said it was im just saying you of all people shouldnt be so hard about it you know that
2800086 it used to be that way now i just want to get out alive
2800087 alright well lets just get there and get things on hand
2800088 guys i think maybe we should get outta here like perhaps now
2800089 i dont know god what if they are in there
2800090 dont you think we should do this the stealthy way
2800091 they wont expect us to just bust in and kick ass
2800092 oh yeah i dont even think im expecting us to do that be rational you guys
2800093 what the fuck are you talking about of course its gun fire
2800094 uncle stumpy you made me think that something was wrong
2800095 my uncle has to have the smartest outlook here look at the facts he was putting up a fake gun fight if those guys think that were in there firing at them or out back firing at someone else they are gonna just walk right in here and think that they have the upper hand
2800096 but if we are all waiting for them somewhere in the woods or something they will have no idea and thus give us the chance to get rid of them
2800097 yeah because that grin says to me you think were stupid
2800098 where the hell is everyone there should be open gun fire by now
2800099 come on lets go to the basement i know that there are guns down there
2800100 its really simple ive been working on the russians side for awhile now know why because i dont know if you remember this or not but the only person i really care about is me
2800101 well deci if youre not going to answer me then i guess ill just have to kill all of our friends i didnt want it to come to this but i think you guys are all deserving of dying since youve taken so many lives and all
2800102 deci you know who im going to kill first im going to kill van first because he took my place after so long he took my place of being close to you and i admit i was a bit jealous because you and me we used to be close

2800106 how do you know its not uncle stumpy hes making walk around
2800107 because your uncle voice was coming from the same place every time he talked waynes was moving trust me
2800108 in todays uncertain economic times a business success is defined by its ability to stay ahead of the curve
2800109 who is going to be under center for lsu this season
2800110 i really think that it might well its difficult for a young guy like jefferson to come in here and accommodate the offense and i dont know that i see them exactly the same i think that hes improved hes much more seasoned ready to play in games
2800111 were not ready to play a game there is no way were ready to play a game but if we work like we did today we will be ready to play and certainly have the opportunity to play well as the season goes forward
2800112 craft volume 8 bottle cap madness recycle it page 148

2800118 ill just lay here and take a nap while you are hiding
2800119 there was one copy going round our school like contraband when it was my turn i read it in one sitting in the playground and missed all my classes
2800120 its a very simple pleasure that white readers take absolutely for granted id never read a book about anyone remotely like me before
2800121 you can make lots of wry self deprecating remarks about being a social climbing boor but that doesnt change the fact that youre a social climbing boor
2800122 is this what we thought we would be in the 60s when were dancing around with flowers in our hair wanting a more erotic and a more sexual life
2800123 your happiness and your pleasure is entirely up to you you have to work and earn it and install your own moral values
2800124 complaint of the west against radical islam why do they have to keep asking god why cant they as it were make up their own minds well its much harder to install your own moral values than to have them imposed by other people or by the system
2800125 but now i realize had i been given the opportunity what i could have been and im about to die
2800126 oh i got some bug bites and decided to put a cast on it
2800127 does jesus have to walk on water twice to make a point

2800129 100 things about your blogger you didnt want to or care to know but are going to know anyways
2800130 see previous verse 1 timothy 6 10 instead his pursuit should be after personal righteousness and godliness as well as stronger faith more genuine love for others more patience and true meekness

2800135 the communication of a statement that makes a false claim expressively stated or implied to be factual that may give an individual business product group government or nation a negative image
2800136 it is a term that is to the best of my knowledge developed by a non medical group i e the law enforcement and legal community and therefore yes it doesnt fall into what would be legitimate medical science
2800137 i saw the russian helicopters swoop down and bomb us with my own eyes it was terrifying so i hid in the basement for three days
2800138 i know that lots of my neighbours are dead i have no idea who is left
2800139 i dont want to be standing here helpless but we have nowhere else to go
2800140 they bombed us were being driven away we dont know where were running to
2800141 wholl take us in the place was in flames and we couldnt stay
2800142 they were very close it felt like they were right above our heads and we could hear firing coming from somewhere although the helicopters werent firing at us
2800143 where can i go i have the children here i have no car i will stay
2800144 i heard the sound of planes flying over zugdidi sometime between six and seven in the morning
2800145 i heard at least six explosions within the space of half an hour people are afraid but theres no panic were staying inside

2800166 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2800167 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2800168 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2800169 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2800170 this was a heinous attack by al qaeda in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2800171 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2800172 al qaeda is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2800173 there was a very large of amount of fire when we arrived it could have been much more serious

2800194 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2800195 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used

2800199 a great idea for a blogging web site is no longer enough
2800200 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2800201 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2800202 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2800203 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2800204 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2800205 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2800206 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2800207 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2800208 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2800209 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2800210 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2800211 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for but he phelps was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2800212 i wish i was just rich so i could just relax at my job and screw with people
2800213 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2800214 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2800215 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2800216 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2800217 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2800218 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2800219 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2800220 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2800221 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2800222 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2800223 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2800224 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2800225 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2800226 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2800227 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2800228 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2800229 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2800230 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2800231 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2800232 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2800233 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2800234 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2800235 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2800236 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2800237 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2800238 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2800239 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2800240 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2800241 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2800242 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2800243 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2800244 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2800245 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2800246 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2800247 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2800248 we are passerbys who need sincere communications and traveling is a means of in depth communication
2800249 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2800250 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2800251 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2800252 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2800253 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2800254 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2800255 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2800256 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2800257 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2800258 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2800259 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2800260 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2800261 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2800262 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2800263 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2800264 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2800265 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2800266 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2800267 eu investi r 100 milh es criando clubes e recuperando escolas melhorando a qualidade das escolas e dos equipamentos
2800268 para mim o mais importante que as pessoas votem conscientemente
2800269 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2800270 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2800271 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2800272 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2800273 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2800274 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2800275 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2800276 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2800277 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2800278 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2800279 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2800280 the list of artists and contributors who have graced the pages of arkitip now reads like a whos who of popular culture many of which received exposure in arkitip long before the mainstream took notice
2800281 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2800282 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2800283 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable

2800285 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2800286 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2800287 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2800288 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete

2800338 hoy estamos en la argentina por debajo de la tendencia de los ltimos doces meses ya que en el ltimo trimestre han dado una inflaci n m s parecida al 1 o 1 5 por ciento que al dos por ciento anterior
2800339 nadie sabe cu nto es la inflaci n aunque si sabemos cuales son las expectativas estas est n por arriba del treinta por ciento anual
2800340 esto es muestra de una especie de anomal a donde las expectativas est n por arriba de la realidad y la realidad est por arriba de lo que se dice oficialmente

2800342 the market is now well off its peak of late 2007 early 2008 with many sellers accepting the state of the market and dropping their expectations accordingly
2800343 as a result we are seeing an increase in activity in the market although sales levels are still well below last year and long term averages
2800344 this as always will be driven by market demand and the age old factors of numbers of buyers versus numbers of sellers and perceptions of when properties represent fair value

2800450 its not often you see studies where they have managed to improve function in this way
2800451 what they seem to have managed is to maintain the mice at this young stage and both restore and maintain normal activity
2800452 as we age we have an increase in protein misfolding and general faults in protein processing so the ability to maintain an effective system to clear these would be beneficial

2800481 they were always the hometown airline they were in the downtown parades they invested in the community
2800482 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2800483 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts
2800484 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about
2800485 the more you raise fees the more you drive airlines and customers away
2800486 its rhetoric ive heard for 41 years but i understand
2800487 these folks arent sure if theyre going to be in business in six months
2800488 organising something on the scale of the lambeth conference will inevitably result in a small deficit sometimes
2800489 the archbishops council met last week to propose a solution
2800490 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2800491 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2800492 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2800493 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2800494 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2800495 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2800496 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2800497 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2800498 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2800499 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2800500 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
2800501 we need a commander in chief who will end the war in iraq but will win it the right way and thats by winning it
2800502 in a lot of ways its actually the same i think in terms of the thing that we love to do which is observing the creative process and watching people who are amazing great characters who are passionate about their careers and their creativity and what they aspire to do
2800503 id rather cut off my arm than give them a right of first refusal
2800504 one of the most central programs to the entire company
2800505 is the category saturated no i think one of the things that makes our shows pop is that they are about peeling the layers off of the creative process
2800506 and if there are too many of them theyll probably go away i dont know how many more competitive reality shows people have time for
2800507 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2800508 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2800509 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2800510 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2800511 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2800512 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2800513 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2800514 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2800515 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2800516 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here
2800517 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2800518 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2800519 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2800520 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2800521 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2800522 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2800523 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2800524 as a matter of psychology i think most of us value investors think we have plenty enough bargains already and may not be able to handle that many more
2800525 until the values can be defined i think youre somewhat taking your life into your hands
2800526 a lot of value investors went into financials in the spring and theyre now getting killed
2800527 a small portion of our losses will not be recovered we underestimated the speed and severity of credit deterioration and overestimated some companies ability to cope with credit and liquidity problems
2800528 i think what bernie mac did that few if any have been able to do was become a success here in chicago
2800529 most of our homegrown talent has to go to l a or new york to become famous but bernie he was selling out the chicago theater before he went out to new york thats next to impossible
2800530 whats interesting about bernies career is that he wasnt a mainstream comic at first his act was very edgy and very raw
2800531 bernie would talk about things that other black comics wouldnt talk about like skin color and how being a very dark skinned black man like him made his life very different from other peoples
2800532 he didnt so much cross over as people crossed over to him
2800533 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them
2800534 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there
2800535 if you let people put tags on you youll never be able to remove them
2800536 youve got to make people respect you respect is bigger than dollars and cents
2800537 the military institution says it is ok to kill and use the most horrible weapons and that killing the enemy is heroic
2800538 i respect dick for having humanity over his military obligations
2800539 the regular people and the government wanted to surrender but the military people didnt want to surrender
2800540 i believe it is the stubbornness of the military people that caused the bombing of japan
2800541 just because people wont vote for obama doesnt mean they are racist
2800542 in 2008 99 of blacks wont vote for a white president
2800543 democrats openly say they are going to you and republicans say they arent but then they do
2800544 african americans vote democratic anyway so what difference does it make how many vote for obama
2800545 would people you know not vote for a black person
2800546 obama is so great the only reason someone wouldnt vote for him is race
2800547 they asked the same whites if most of the people they knew would vote for a black candidate nineteen percent said that those they knew would not
2800548 how many of you know someone you think wont vote for a black person
2800549 the streets of the georgian capital are plastered with posters of george w bush alongside his georgian protege george w bush avenue leads to tbilisi airport
2800550 attacks by seperatists claimed the lives of at least ten georgian soldiers
2800551 despite our call for peace and a unilateral ceasefire separatists continued the shelling of georgian villages
2800552 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
2800553 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months
2800554 are you saying that countries with tanks are wolves what do you suppose an m 1 abrams tank tells an iraqi
2800555 so after a couple of days of skirmishing along the unofficial border between his forces and those of the separatists the georgian leader launched a full blown invasion whose aim his government said was to restore constitutional order that is control by the central government in south ossetia plainly the offensive was a gamble because saakashvili should have had little doubt about moscows readiness to defend the separatists moreover nato officials had repeatedly warned the georgian government against launching any attempt to resolve the dispute through military means still he pressed forward
2800556 the streets of the georgian capital are plastered with posters of george w bush alongside his georgian protege george w bush avenue leads to tbilisi airport
2800557 the streets of the georgian capital are plastered with posters of george w bush alongside his georgian protege
2800558 hey were just here to help out our communist brothers
2800559 the returning ingush faced considerable animosity from the ossetians the ingush were forced to buy their houses back from the ossetians and russians
2800560 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
2800561 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months
2800562 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali

2800564 lord grant that marshal wade may by thy mighty aid victory bring may he sedition hush and like a torrent rush rebellious scots to crush god save the queen
2800565 this is an issue that is complicated we should not rush to judgment without an understanding of the situation
2800566 all i see when i look at this situation is that russian soldiers are killing people in a country that is not russia that makes them wrong regardless of their intentions since neither nation is the usa the usa needs to stay out of it
2800567 all i see when i look at this situation is that us soldiers are killing people in a country that is not the usa that makes them wrong regardless of their intentions since neither nation is the usa the usa needs to stay out of it
2800568 the police dog barks in warning echoed by a bleep from tens cellphone as the cop isolates his sim from all the others in the room with the scanner
2800569 since the burmese military has ignored the call of the internal national community to begin an inclusive political process and unilaterally imposed a constitution designed to consolidate military rule it is imperative to review the international approach towards burma
2800570 a full blown castigation of the burmese generals could have caused considerable discomfort for bangkok which has just assumed the chair of asean which includes burma
2800571 ive got a confession to make i dont like midcap stocks and i dont feel too bad about it because neither do a lot of other portfolio theorists its nothing personal the problem is that theyre neither fish nor fowl
2800572 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2800573 there are critics though and i am one of them that think perhaps investors are not quite getting what they expect for a start the holdings in the index funds are market capitalisation weighted this sounds sensible of course except when you consider just how much the biggest companies dominate the portfolio the top one hundred stocks in america representing just 3 of the number of stocks in the index funds actually account for over 60 of the funds invested in vanguards fund
2800574 when you get down to the genuinely small capitalisation stocks there is actually very little money invested in each stock which is why it probably isnt surprising that over long periods of time the wilshire 5000 index performs pretty much the same as the big capitalisation growth stock dominated s amp p500 index
2800575 the art of creating a good portfolio is not about owning everything in market weighted proportions as the total market index does but in having significant exposure to every asset class and rebalancing the portfolio at an appropriate frequency
2800576 so if you want to take advantage of the rebalancing effect you are going to need to have a much larger small cap value exposure in your portfolio than just a couple of percent
2800577 while s amp p 500 index and total market funds make for effective pieces on an investment pie they should only be slices not the whole pie they just dont provide sufficient diversification as stand alone vehicles
2800578 the notion that compared with their large and mid cap counterparts small cap active equity managers are more likely to outperform their market segment
2800579 by singing in harmony from the same page of the same investing hymnal the diehards drown out market noise
2800580 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge
2800581 so which is the better measure of inflationary expectations the spread between tips and treasuries or a spread between tips and a risk adjusted rate for all long bonds

2800646 sun exposure most people meet their vitamin d needs through exposure to sunlight 6 ultraviolet uv b radiation with a wavelength of 290 315 nanometers penetrates uncovered skin and converts cutaneous 7 dehydrocholesterol to previtamin d 27 28 season geographic latitude time of day cloud cover smog skin melanin content and sunscreen are among the factors that affect uv radiation exposure and vitamin d synthesis 28 the uv energy above 42 degrees north latitude a line approximately between the northern border of california and boston is insufficient for cutaneous vitamin d synthesis from november through february 6 in far northern latitudes this reduced intensity lasts for up to 6 months latitudes below 34 degrees north a line between los angeles and columbia south carolina allow for cutaneous production of vitamin d throughout the year 14 complete cloud cover reduces uv energy by 50 shade including that produced by severe pollution reduces it by 60 29 uvb radiation does not penetrate glass so exposure to sunshine indoors through a window does not produce vitamin d 30 sunscreens with a sun protection factor of 8 or more appear to block vitamin d producing uv rays although in practice people generally do not apply sufficient amounts cover all sun exposed skin or reapply sunscreen regularly 31 skin likely synthesizes some vitamin d even when it is protected by sunscreen as typically applied the factors that affect uv radiation exposure and research to date on the amount of sun exposure needed to maintain adequate vitamin d levels make it difficult to provide general guidelines it has been suggested for example that approximately 5 30 minutes of sun exposure between 10 am and 3 pm at least twice a week to the face arms legs or back without sunscreen usually lead to sufficient vitamin d synthesis and that the moderate use of commercial tanning beds that emit 2 6 uvb radiation is also effective 28 individuals with limited sun exposure need to include good sources of vitamin d in their diet or take a supplement despite the importance of the sun to vitamin d synthesis it is prudent to limit exposure of skin to sunlight 31 uv radiation is a carcinogen responsible for most of the estimated 1 5 million skin cancers and the 8 000 deaths due to metastatic melanoma that occur annually in the united states 31 lifetime cumulative uv damage to skin is also largely responsible for some age associated dryness and other cosmetic changes it is not known whether a desirable level of regular sun exposure exists that imposes no or minimal risk of skin cancer over time

2800682 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2800683 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2800684 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2800688 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2800689 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2800690 thc is shaped much like a neurotransmitter called anandamide which means it can sneak itself into the brains anandamide receptor proteins and start to cause mischief
2800691 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2800692 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2800693 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2800695 our guide explains the thresholds that will apply as well as the special rules we secured to make the paperwork easier for trucking companies
2800696 we explained to the government that it would create a paperwork nightmare if it decided to force interstate trucking companies to calculate how much diesel they consume in each state and territory
2800697 as a result the system has a special rule for transport fuel trucking companies get to assign fuel consumption to the state or territory where it is purchased not where it is actually used
2800698 for example a trucking company that buys fuel in brisbane for runs to sydney will assign the fuel consumption to queensland rather than trying to split it between queensland and new south wales
2800699 its an important rule because it means trucking companies can use their fuel purchasing records to help determine if theyll have to report under the new system

2800731 lets not irritate the physicians or else theyre going to take their patients to another hospital
2800732 the number one issue in the errors that occur is bad communication
2800733 the scissors didnt cut to his liking he was trying to cut suture material he said they were dull he tossed them across the room one of the nurses had to dodge the scissors
2800734 these incidents happen because the or environment is so high stress
2800735 surgeons hold patients lives in their hands yet theyre dependent on equipment and people who are outside their control this incident was over a year ago and there has not been another incident with this physician
2800736 you have an industry in crisis where people are having to do much more with limited resources that combination can be a potent one
2800737 weve decided to do a five part mini series one big story that will run during one week
2800738 i wanted to make a really big noise about the show
2800739 torchwood really represents the essence of the channel its sexy action packed and a little bit subversive
2800740 so rumor has it that the bbc was unhappy and russell had to rush to write her out of series 3
2800741 personally id be very happy if they didnt add any more principle characters between jack ianto and gwen there are plenty of possible stories to tell for a season thats only having a five episode run
2800742 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k
2800743 i just learned how to speak like american kids because they made fun of my scottish accent and i didnt want to be bullied when im back in the u k with scottish people i actually go back to my scottish accent

2800747 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
2800748 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
2800749 but i say to you who hear love your enemies do good to those who hate you bless those who curse you pray for those who mistreat you
2800750 whoever hits you on the cheek offer him the other also and whoever takes away your coat do not withhold your shirt from him either
2800751 give to everyone who asks of you and whoever takes away what is yours do not demand it back
2800752 treat others the same way you want them to treat you
2800753 if you love those who love you what credit is that to you
2800754 if you do good to those who do good to you what credit is that to you
2800755 if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive what credit is that to you
2800756 but love your enemies and do good and lend expecting nothing in return and your reward will be great and you will be sons of the most high for he himself is kind to ungrateful and evil men

2800786 she would not let us help her but when she was at university she sent us happy texts and sounded fine
2800787 i came out of my room and saw laura suspended from a red ribbon tied to the bannister my housemate phoned for an ambulance
2800788 i had known her for two years she suffered from bulimia took anti depressants and did cut herself
2800789 this is a very sad story laura had suffered from a number of medical and psychiatric difficulties and unfortunately had harmed herself in the past by cutting herself
2800790 i am not aware of any previous attempts to take her own life the note she left referring to her thoughts and feelings that she was overweight connects to her psychiatric difficulties
2800791 the level of alcohol she had consumed may well have impacted on her judgement because of the uncertainty about her motives and the state of her mind due to the alcohol i am going to record an open verdict im afraid we shall never know what was in lauras mind
2800792 everyone who knew her loved her she was one of the few people who it was always a genuine pleasure to be around and talk to always so bright and bubbly and full of fun and laughter
2800793 i think i speak for my circle of friends when i say having laura on a night out made the whole night more enjoyable
2800794 its always such a shame when someone dies so young but for laura she was always so full of life that it seems all the more sad she was genuinely one of my favourite people
2800795 she was an enthusiastic and bright student popular with staff and her fellow students and she is missed greatly
2800796 mayberryfan said yucky i appreciate your thoughts and thank you for sharing them i have no intention of endangering anyone involved in the previous group i am not out to hurt anyone well except for heidi diaz and only by legal means i understand the need for the blogger in question to be hidden i gave you my word that i will not reveal what you revealed to me and i wont you can bank on it as for the comments you list here from jo it has been explained that she made them in an emotional state there are more issues there than you know and they have absolutely nothing to with any of this they are personal please do your best to understand and let it go ive said before this wasnt intended as a pejorative against all the anti kk bloggers after all i happen to be one of many in that group perhaps you dont consider me as part of that group and you have a right to your opinion i will take your word that prue is a good person i didnt realize who she was at the time but she sent a nice comment to me when my uncle died recently we just see this particular issue differently in pms to you and on your board i have said that there are no hard feelings its time to let this go best of luck with your group i hope you dig up some great stuff that can be used to get kimkins closed down forever and protect people from the likes of heidi that is what were all working for after all as for what v0x meant youll have to ask v0x thanks again and lets let this go okay july 18 2008 8 38 am
2800797 i know from working with mimi and medusa for months behind the scenes that they have gathered info on anyone and everyone whos even remotely connected to the kimkins scandal
2800798 i have no proof that they contacted your ex husband but i believe they did
2800799 however all this leads me to believe mimi medusa and pru were in on trying to learn more about you and contacted your ex
2800800 but i have witnessed their wreckless behavior before and feel strongly they are only involved in all this in order to write a book or get a movie deal
2800801 i dont believe now as i once did that they are working for
2800802 prudentia said medusa first of all let me say that im sorry that your friendship with me has resulted in mbfs guns being leveled at you as well also just so no one wonders how trista reacted i am going to post part of her reply to mbf here please note that i have done a bit of editing as noted to prevent personal information from being broadcast on the blogs from trista to mbf here is how i think john found out he wanted what he believed were legal remedies to be happen so he could be rid of his financial obligation he googled my name and up pops paperwork on the kimkins lawsuit he said to me that when he found out about kimkins he researched all about it knowing him he read every post on the boards and every blog he knew more of what was going on than i did i fact he kept making little comments about ducks and saying quack i thought he was just off his rocker not surprising making these comments i hadnt been following along at lcf in months anyways he was trying to get me to agree to what he wanted which is what we wanted anyway and had already begun paperwork he was a pain in the butt until this business was final and i havent heard from him since i dont really care how he found out or who gathered info there is nothing about me that im afraid for people to find out i dont believe that prudentia mimi and medusa contacted him i mean why out of the blue would they get the bright idea to contact him why its not anything that would help or hinder the case no info about any of us has any bearing on the case kwim so as you can see trista does not believe what mbf had to say she is fine and she is in this fight against heidi to the bitter end mbfs attempts to stir up a public outcry against us failed in this case i dont fear martinas martini i fear someone running around half cocked trying to create drama for their own sake regardless of the repercussions and consequences july 28 2008 4 29 pm
2800803 should ultra skinny models be banned the fashion industry claims it is being unfairly pillaged for the size 0 phenomenon but self regulation has done little to weed out emaciated models
2800804 they have to understand that being thin is our job
2800805 we didnt want teenagers to think excessive slimness is a model of beauty
2800806 the whole size 0 thing has come from hollywood not the catwalks
2800807 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it

2800810 you get used to a new guy and it takes a little bit of time and usually you get the luxury of doing it in the spring where no ones really around or cheering for laps
2800811 i need to call my mom and have her tape espn
2800812 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
2800813 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2800814 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2800815 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
2800816 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts
2800817 the ball comes out hard and fast and straight and long so thats always good
2800818 its been a whirlwind for him and theres a lot of new information going in were progressing quickly
2800819 until i can see the cadence and see the mechanics
2800820 brett had his two hard boiled eggs a little bit of orange juice
2800821 there was a garnish i think and some hashbrowns and i can take you through minute by minute after that
2800822 the eggs were mixed with the hashbrowns so i dont know which one actually hit his mouth first ill film it next time
2800823 she and her mother are working to try and help other people
2800824 television thrives on shock effect thats good for dr phil but it doesnt do anything for the patient in some twisted way it glorifies her illness

2800829 the fashion world is in shock after the death of supermodel ruslana korshunova yesterday
2800830 i heard what sounded like a gunshot or a bomb or an explosion
2800831 i looked down the street and i say to the cop did that person just get hit by a car
2800832 shes one of the sweetest nicest people youll ever meet
2800833 im still in shock the world lost a great person
2800834 we had to find her and we searched high and low until we did
2800835 a model who walked runways around the world and graced the covers of fashion magazines fell from a manhattan building saturday in an apparent suicide new york city police said
2800836 shes a very sweet girl she was always smiling i never see her depressed
2800837 it appeared she fell from the balcony of her ninth floor apartment police said where a large hole was visible in construction netting hanging on the front of the 12 story building
2800838 i heard what sounded like a gunshot or a bomb or an explosion
2800839 all i saw was something moving out of the corner of my eye and then boom it sounded like a bass drum when she hit the ground
2800840 the world lost a great person there were no signs thats whats driving me crazy i dont see one reason why she would do that
2800841 unclear if anyone else was in the apartment at the time of the fall or if a suicide note was found
2800842 i saw her by chance and she looked like something out of a fairytale
2800843 i heard what sounded like a gunshot or a bomb or an explosion
2800844 i looked down the street and i say to the cop did that person just get hit by a car
2800845 said the worker who identified himself only as patrick 32 of brooklyn
2800846 her head was on the left side and blood was coming out in a pool
2800847 shes one of the sweetest nicest people youll ever meet
2800848 im still in shock the world lost a great person
2800849 thats whats driving me crazy i dont see one reason why she would do that

2800852 i swear these hairs on my neck are spreading ive got a rash of little hairs theyre growing longer at the back of my neck now too im fuzzifying
2800853 a body suffering from anorexia nervosa is denied the nutrients it needs to function normally to conserve energy the body slows down its processes causing a range of serious medical problems
2800854 growing up my family had a 38 wood chris craft that required more cleaning than time to fish we lived on a canal and had docks behind our house and i used to remember my dad having to spin the boat around so that i would be facing down the canal for the next trip that is when the work started cleaning teak decks and scrubbing all surfaces when i think back i have fond memories
2800855 ive always fished from the time i was a farm kid growing up in southern minnesota and wed look forward to rainy nights so dad would tell us early the next morning
2800856 i started fly fishing when i was 12 years old on a little lake in newaygo county michigan i was out fishing with my spinning rod using green leaf worms on a small lake just before the sun went down this older guy waded out into the lake and started fly fishing he was fishing for bluegills with rubber spiders and small poppers the bluegills he caught were twice as big as the fish i was catching he started talking to me and he offered to let me try his fly rod after the first bluegill grabbed the fly i was hooked on fly fishing a couple days later i went out to buy fly fishing equipment i couldnt believe how expensive fly fishing equipment was and still is pretty soon i bought a cheap wright amp mcgill fiberglass rod then i bought more and more lol
2800857 many years ago in my late thirties i took up fly fishing again due to back problems i had given up tennis and i needed something to do when i fished i found it was a great stress reliever and an escape from the rat race i especially feel blessed to have been able to spend as much time in nature as i have my spiritual health seems to be directly related to the amount of time i spend with him in his world
2800858 i fly fish because it is magical there is no better feeling than standing on a lake shore or in a river early in the morning and feeling the world come alive
2800859 i fish now as a means of relaxation and as a means to get to quiet beautiful places for the continued challenges it presents in its many varied aspects for the never ending jolt when something wild and live gets on the end of my line
2800860 night fishing for sea trout in south wales where you start fishing once the bats start flying typically around 10 30pm at night standing in a river in the dead of the night with no illumination other than the stars and fishing by sound rather than by sight both heightens the senses of the immediate environment as well as making you realise how tiny and insignificant we are in gods great universe the night passes broken only by the occasional splash of what must surely be a monster fish those long hours give plenty of time for the mind to wander contemplating matters great and small public and personal its only afterwards that your realize how little time we allow in our normal daily lives for quiet contemplation and how beneficial relaxing and spiritual it can be
2800861 well ive got to admit something prayed for fish yep its sort of silly i suppose but i dont think ill be punished to severely for asking for that i would say most of my spiritual moments come in times of reflection before or after a day of fishing those tired reflective moments where youre usually thankful for the blessings god has given you blessings like the money for fishing poles and gas to get to the laugh not a lot of people in this world get to fish recreationally past childhood
2800862 i would say its a continuous spiritual activity although i have been really awe inspired by watching a gorgeous sunset or enjoying the last hr of light when it seems like the earth stands still and basically having all of my senses stimulated i definitely have had more religious moments in the environs than sitting in temple
2800863 i have never gone fly fishing in my life but i have a lot of religious moments doing other things i love to do like singing and playing the piano
2800864 if you love fishing how can you not want to preserve it while fishing i am part of nature and god and it is my personal job to preserve gods world i want to protect this would for my children and my childrens children
2800865 fishing and fly fishing in particular cannot exist in an unhealthy environment when we fish for trout we are truly dependent on trout having cold unpolluted water its a precarious existence being a trout a drought chemical spill road project or any one of dozens of things can destroy a fishery in a moment or over several years
2800866 it might be out of pure selfishness but i love hiking hunting fishing and its a lot less fun doing those things when youre worried about stepping foot on someones private land or snagging boots and tires in the bottom of a river and i love to catch fish and ill admit a lot of those fish were planted there by the division of wildlife so its a fairly inseparable relationship saying that fishing and preserving the environment arent related is like saying you hate the president when youve never voted
2800867 i have started to pick up litter this is something i would have never imagined myself doing now when i am even walking down the road and see trash i will pick it up and throw it away you really grasp how delicate nature is when you are fishing you see that all of your surroundings are alive and that by throwing your trash down will end up hurting it even in the short term
2800868 yes i do volunteer work for the colorado division of wildlife i belong to conservation organizations and make financial contributions i pick up trash left by others i release most of the fish i catch
2800869 i do in fact belong to conservation organizations such as trout unlimited and give them my support from a personal standpoint i never fail to be disappointed by how many of my fellow anglers and recreationists are slobs some might say litterbugs but i call them slobs when i go fishing i carry a litterbag with me to pick up litter on streambanks and also in the access areas its a never ending challenge
2800870 dear rabbi i have a confession to make i have never fished in my life 77yrs however i enjoy your bulletin very much that is why i am a subscriber best wishes joy

2800900 i voted that the crusades were unprovoked acts of aggression
2800901 you might want to consider the fact that the the crusades were attempts to re capture formerly christian lands
2800902 are you suggesting that the khanate did not reach as eastern europe and persia in the 13th century
2800903 and the real question still stands were the crusades justified
2800904 this will be a war of extermination and a momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the mongolian massacres

2800941 is the goal of the russian federation to change the leadership of georgia
2800942 sometimes those leaders need to contemplate how useful they have become to their people
2800943 we must condemn russias military assault on the sovereign state of georgia including the targeting of civilians and the campaign of terror against the georgian population
2800944 since russia is impeding georgian forces from withdrawing rejecting a cease fire and continuing to carry out military attacks against civilian centers its claims of a humanitarian purpose clearly are not credible
2800945 this statement ambassador is completely unacceptable particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to the civilian populations in iraq and afghanistan and serbia
2800946 whatever your policy might be please do not undertake propaganda within the security council
2800947 the intellectual elite causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire society should one point out that from ancient times decline in courage has been considered the beginning of the end
2800948 the constant desire to have still more things and a still better life and the struggle to obtain them imprints many western faces with worry and even depression the majority of people have been granted well being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about
2800949 today well being in the life of western society has begun to reveal its pernicious mask
2800950 the defense of individual rights has reached such extremes as to make society as a whole defenseless against certain individuals it is time in the west to defend not so much human rights as human obligations
2800951 destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence such as for example misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror
2800952 a false slogan characteristic of a false era people also have the right not to know and it is a much more valuable one the right not to have their divine souls stuffed with gossip nonsense vain talk a person who works and leads a meaningful life does not need this excessive burdening flow of information
2800953 through intense suffering our country has now achieved a spiritual development of such intensity that the western system in its present state of spiritual exhaustion does not look attractive
2800954 that makes him much more acceptable to the rest of the world of any president weve had so far
2800955 in order to maintain our leadership in a global economy we have to work with the rest of the world with the transfer of technology we either lead the world or we get trampled by it
2800956 ive been answering so many questions ive almost lost my voice
2800957 i just wanted to stop by and see what all the fuss was about

2800959 if we fill a barrel with water and have everyone who comes by express their loving intent for the tree

2800961 i just had to come here and sit in this peaceful place with the magnolia
2800962 the core of the banking industry is fairly sound and the reason is that it comes into this by and large with a fairly large capital position
2800963 we will see more bank failures but they will be mostly small banks that got too concentrated in certain types of risk home mortgages home equity loans lending to builders that sort of thing
2800964 the average consumer is in no position to be playing bank examiner
2800965 the fdic says 87 percent work their way off the problem list and back to healthy status
2800966 people are being far more financially astute now because they have to be theyre protecting their investments and protecting their retirement theyre protecting their family wealth
2800967 wall street performance isnt the same as main street performance
2800968 we are well capitalized we have 50 billion in liquidity and thats pretty darn good
2800969 i think were going to see additional bank failures but is this a long term trend i dont know about that
2800970 some banks on the edge are probably going to fail but i think the failures will be similar to these last two and less similar to the indymac case
2800971 ai ramas de proasta astia cu care ti o arzi au tulit o toti
2800972 back when i was younger all we did was go outside and play football or listen to the game on the radio tv blah blah
2800973 well video games are becoming a new medium and theyre becoming as big as movies now and make just as much money as them
2800974 i live so far below my means that it doesnt really register

2800976 the economy starts to tank people get tired of it

2800979 you dont have to chase as many dollars to have a quality of life
2800980 it isnt just cutting back on things its about people not needing so many things and putting more attention into their personal interests and their family and friends being creative being of service
2800981 for me to be able to walk out my door and have everybody in the hall know me thats a really great experience
2800982 and if anything happens to me i know theres somebody next door wholl take care of me
2800983 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2800984 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2800985 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2800986 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2800987 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2800988 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2800989 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2800990 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
2800991 there is no need for us to carry out an inspection now
2800992 we received word from the hemraj family spokesman pastor paul saul that there would be no need for an inspection as the creche would not be operating again
2800993 the onus is on the parent to ensure that the daycare centre or creche is registered with the municipality the creches can only be registered with us if they comply with our stringent health and safety requirements once registered our officers conduct regular inspections to ensure that the creches are complying with our health and safety standards
2800994 i was told the whale sharks skin was rough so i took a scraper along with me and scratched its back it slowed down the next day it returned and i did the same thing it obviously enjoyed it by day three it was there waiting to have its back scratched
2800995 but the demon shark still remained a mystery to me
2800996 we also had about 500 giraffe zebra impala warthog but particularly special were the leopards
2800997 i attended the oldest school in the country kings canterbury because of the right contacts i was accepted into the inner circle the colonial yobbo amid the toffs
2800998 the raf and british troops the kenya police and the general service units were the main forces against the mau mau however the pseudo gangs were very effective of european origin but kenya bred
2800999 we would give them a nice soft leaf to use after they had been to the toilet but under it would be a stinging nettle
2801000 i even played rugby against idi amin he was a popular second row forward in the kings african rifles
2801001 i found that they knew everything there was to know about the biology of sharks but were sadly lacking about shark behaviour and i wanted to know more about these animals that people had such a phobia about

2801049 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade

2801070 le dar a mi alabanza a china por tal inauguraci n incre ble fant stica rimbombante acrob tica fuera de este mundo que tendr a que repensar de cualquier otra naci n que alguna vez pueda ganarles a los juegos de pek n en los a os por venir estoy bastante seguro que hay una gran sensaci n de envidia de que china haya podido armar un show tan espectacular tuve una sensaci n de orgullo nadando en mi coraz n a pesar que la naci n anfitriona tiene poca o ninguna conexi n conmigo creo que a esto es a lo que llaman una asia para todo asia
2801071 la ceremonia inaugural fue simplemente espectacular china de verdad tom esta oportunidad de informar al mundo sobre s misma en algunos modos sutiles la entrada de los atletas de manera no convencional al acostumbrado orden alfab tico creo que esto muestra que china est preparada para no seguir ninguna regla sino m s bien que est lista para hacer sus propias reglas de hecho as ha sido para que el mundo las siga
2801072 esta incre ble ceremonia de inauguraci n fue simplemente alucinante capturaron mi coraz n y mis ideas desde una perspectiva deportiva y de ciudadano del mundo las multitudes estuvieron en verdad magn ficas las actuaciones deslumbrantes y espectaculares poniendo en vitrina c mo los inventos y creaciones de china han ayudado a moldear el mundo ciertamente estuvo a la altura de su reputaci n y promete ser la mejor ceremonia de inauguraci n ol mpica de la historia
2801073 es grandioso ver a un pa s asi tico armar un espect culo maravilloso pero ya que los chinos han gastado millones para asegurarse que sus olimpiadas sean un xito no puedo evitar pensar en los millones de personas en darfur que est n sufriendo debido a que los chinos siguen apoyando el genocidio ah china puede haber preparado la mayor ceremonia de inauguraci n de las olimpiadas pero deben mirarse a s mismos por ayudar en la muerte de cientos de miles de personas a cientos de millas de distancia

2801100 the industry is at a different level today compared to five years ago earlier recruitment was happening only from a few good colleges now benches are being filled by candidates various institutions some of them dont match up inspite of training its the under performers who are getting the pink slip
2801101 in fact earlier too non performers were asked to go but its only now that the issue has come into the limelight

2801272 russia has not only retaken south ossetia its protectorate inhabited by its citizens but is also making georgia pay by bombing georgian territory this is to teach them a very hard lesson on who is the master in this region
2801273 it is also a signal to the us and other countries who is in charge in this region
2801274 by trying to reintegrate south ossetia by force mikhail saakashvili georgian president will most likely lose these two territories once and for all

2801330 eight minor acts of physical discipline events against children were prosecuted with six yet to be resolved
2801331 the problem is that there is no statutory definition for either smacking or minor acts of physical discipline
2801332 so rather than call them smacking and draw attention they are simply being classified under this undefined category
2801333 these so called minor acts also show a 200 increase in families being investigated over a six month period yet less than 10 were serious enough to consider warranting a prosecution this would suggest that there is a huge drain on police resources in trying to meet the requirements of this flawed law
2801334 it is concerning that the anti smacking law is being promoted as working by playing around with definitions and that so many families are being investigated for minor acts it is important to remember that there is still a definition of child assault and this is the category that we should be throwing the resources and weight of the law at
2801335 you know a law is a bad law when it fails to deal with the problem it was supposed to deal with while good families become the victims of it because nobody can accurately define what the law says or means

2801431 my mom and aunt were just in town and enjoyed a great stay at the inn
2801432 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2801433 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2801434 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2801435 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2801436 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2801437 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2801438 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2801439 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2801440 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2801441 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2801442 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2801443 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

2801445 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2801446 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2801447 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2801448 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2801449 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2801450 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2801451 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2801452 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2801453 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2801454 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2801455 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2801456 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2801457 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2801458 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2801459 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2801460 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2801461 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2801462 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2801463 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2801464 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2801465 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2801466 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2801467 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2801468 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2801469 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2801470 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2801471 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2801472 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2801473 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2801474 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2801475 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2801476 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2801477 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2801478 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2801479 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2801480 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2801481 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2801482 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2801483 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2801484 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2801485 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2801486 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2801487 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2801488 who are open to doing something on the production side
2801489 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2801490 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2801491 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2801492 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2801493 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2801494 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2801495 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2801496 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2801497 this is one of my favorite places for a quick lunch in oakland
2801498 im broke and hungover but i can still afford this bagel
2801499 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2801500 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2801501 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2801502 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2801503 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2801504 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2801505 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2801506 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2801507 jewelry is the hardest thing to buy for a woman

2801509 good sandwiches and various different types of sandwiches cool location staff was cool and even brought out my latte instead of shouting
2801510 if i give it to you i have to pay for it
2801511 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2801512 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2801513 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2801514 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2801515 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2801516 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2801517 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2801518 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2801519 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2801520 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

2801523 i am a huge admirer of vedran he is a top class player with a bright future ahead of him and i am delighted that he continues to be a part of our plans at manchester city
2801524 it is a real boost for everyone at the club vedran is a great lad and i am really looking forward to working with him over the coming seasons
2801525 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2801526 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2801527 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2801528 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2801529 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2801530 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2801531 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2801532 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2801533 our client and his family live adjacent to the proposed development and accordingly they have a particular interest in any proposals which may represent a threat to their established residential amenities
2801534 does not object to the principle of the redevelopment of this site
2801535 our client considers that by reason of mass scale and density the three storey over basement terraced housing blocks would stand out in this conservation area characterised by detached and semi detached single family period residential homes
2801536 pursuing a strategy to stealthily double the density of the site by submitting new planning applications this is the seventh such application in eight years in an effort to increase the permitted floor area from 1 564 sq metres to 2 782 sq metres
2801537 is recognised as a unique dublin example of edwardian urban design and architecture the area is an important element of dublins weave and is recognised as such by its designation as a residential conservation area
2801538 if the current proposal is granted permission it will set a precedent for further such developments with the eventual total destruction of the shrewsbury road conservation area
2801539 reflects an era of gracious living from a bygone age

2801542 we remain committed to a speedy resolution however it has not been possible to meet the financial demands of the merchant service guild
2801543 we hope there is a ground swell and the site creates some interest it is almost a criminal waste to see a victorian era tunnel sitting there disused the response has been encouraging and the majority of respondents think its a brilliant idea
2801544 we were astonished when i later heard they were 600 000 to 850 000
2801545 we would have to consider the practicalities and cost would be a driver its a wonderful asset but in its current form the tunnel is only being used for services the potential exists for it to be used in other ways which is wonderful for the city but as i say it comes down to practicality and further investigation would be needed
2801546 we walked 100m and no further with a gas monitor and it certainly was active it indicated it was not good idea to stay in there for too long underfoot the floor was very wet and boggy
2801547 in its current form its not a place one would want to go in running shoes
2801548 the question has now changed from when will prices stop rising to when can we expect to see them stabilise
2801549 they were holed up in their snow cave mr holden was obviously in pain but we literally dragged him out to the helicopter and he was quite happy

2801566 i think winston will take the poll just as a motivation to get out there and work harder
2801567 i guess he will be looking at his strategies he probably wont read too much into that poll at this particular point
2801568 on the other hand hes a household name and brand
2801569 people have written him off before and hes come back
2801570 i wouldnt want to say at this point who that might be but there certainly is a statute which is very clear title 8 that identifies the different offenses with the harboring context that could be brought
2801571 the number of unemployed increased by 861 000 in may the third largest monthly increase since the us labor department started collecting figures in 1948 and more than 60 was accounted for by new entrants and those re entering the workforce with the bulk of the new workers in the 16 to 24 bracket
2801572 at the same time that the economy flourished during rubins and summers tenure 1995 2000 per capita income rose from 22 153 to 25 469 in inflation adjusted dollars median family income rose from 53 349 to 59 398 and unemployment fell from 5 6 to 4 0 percent both treasury secretaries were accused of acceding to wall street pressure to eliminate deficit spending at the expense of the poor and unemployed

2801588 it is obvious that as world champions our biggest strengths are in the lineout and in the scrum
2801589 and it is precisely here where the opposition will try and neutralise us the all blacks use tactics which are illegal and as far as i know if it is illegal then it is not allowed
2801590 we have picked up three things that they do which are illegal in the lineouts
2801591 it starts with their flanker coming through the lineout illegally to stop any ball thrown down to the scrum half they also do their best to play the lineout jumpers in the air and jump across the line and then thirdly they manage to close the gap to half a metre between the two sets of players
2801592 all i know is that if there is a rule and if it applies one time it applies to both teams the referee has to blow according to the rules and not according to his interpretation
2801593 it was a huge decision to send them both back
2801594 in last weeks decision if i looked at reserve scrum half and choosing between ruan pienaar and fourie du preez i sent fourie back i would have to have had my head read
2801595 the same goes in a decision between jaque fourie and frans steyn
2801596 i told them steyn and pienaar you can go back and decide where you want to play
2801597 no really we are losing in iraq damnit we have to lose in iraq weve invested way to much in defeat someone get me a towel to wipe the spittle off my face

2801618 i think in the first half it was just a matter of us kind of settling down
2801619 i mean this is a moment we have been waiting for for three years
2801620 we forced a lot of turnovers and made it difficult for them to run their offense
2801621 we obviously feel like we can improve in several areas
2801622 look i had five dunks in one game thats because of the crowd last time i had five dunks in a game i was like 17 so thats all because of the energy in this crowd
2801623 i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
2801624 it was our first game we were very anxious we missed shots that we normally would hit but at the end of the day you win by almost 30 points youve got to take good things out of that
2801625 we played very very hard we give ourselves a chance defensively every night thats what its all about with us
2801626 we came out a little tight we knew that it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams especially china playing in front of their home crowd
2801627 maybe this was our biggest mistake that we think on the floor that this can be continued you know

2801649 do you want to know how i got the scars
2801650 she even smoked standing on the threshold to the balcony but shed never actually go outside look here
2801651 these are a mans cigarettes ruslana only smoked thin ladys cigarettes why didnt the police pay attention to this
2801652 i think its possible ruslana was pulled over there and thrown off
2801653 i cant believe she just wanted to say goodbye when she came to see me the day before she died why didnt the police interrogate me they didnt interrogate mark either ruslanas boyfriend and he was the last person to speak with her
2801654 kaminskiys ex wife issued a restraining order against him in 2001 he was arrested for illegally possessing a firearm and marijuana in 2003 and 2005
2801655 komsomolskaya pravda if you print even one word about us well sue
2801656 call me maksim ive been in the modelling business for a long time and my wife is also a model this is just to let you know that i know my way around the business
2801657 kaminskiy is the right hand man of petr listerman a matchmaker who sets up wealthy men with models petr has a show on muz tv called beauties and the beast in one episode he and kaminskiy went to milan to find young models
2801658 you think ruslana may have fallen under the influence of these dubious characters
2801659 but here are some facts for you several years ago i held a casting session at a moscow club kaminskiy stood in the doorway listernman called me that evening and demanded i give him one of the models who had gone to the club he said we could make big money if we delivered her to the bed of an oligarch during his trip to kurshevel and there was real pressure with threats and promises to earn unheard of cash
2801660 im not saying anything but if some rich man paid for ruslana then listerman would have been on her like a bulldog they give a lot of money for that id guess the starting price would be around one million dollars mark is a professional pimp hes the macho who works in the girls and does the pre sale preparation

2801664 i confirm everything thats being said about the restaurants purchase by the italian press 3 5 million euro 5 5 million was paid
2801665 ruslana korshunova was part of the same agency as i am in moscow black model management
2801666 we have the same agent aleksey kalinin he has a lot of experience and huge connections abroad aleksey was her russia side agent until the very end his agency takes a cut from all our work done abroad something like 10 percent the agency that represents us abroad also takes a cut about 20 percent taxes are also deducted before we see any money and taxes are huge in the u s expenses for food and pocket money are also taken out of our salary as the foreign agency pays all these expenses in advance
2801667 im not in the plus yet either although ive already been working abroad two years
2801668 foreigners come up with all sorts of expenses and present models with astronomical bills
2801669 for example my agency made me make new photographs but they prohibited me from using any photographer but their own it turned out he charged me far more than the market price the agency also overcharged me for other services so they could deduct the costs later
2801670 nervous stress is part of the package for new models
2801671 i was first sent to tokyo at 15 i wound up in a strange country without knowing the language and without any moral support what happened to me occurs with all new models abroad i started going to night clubs to relax and get rid of my nervousness i drank smoked and tried to save myself from my depression and stress i started missing castings and went to some of them inebriated i couldnt sleep called home and yelled get me out of here i dont want anything anymore but my parents werent rich enough to go to japan to get me and the agency wouldnt let me go no one wanted to give me work after seeing how i looked i gained 8 pounds from going to all the night clubs i was really out of shape i remember my booker in japan called aleksey and complained he said i was too young and didnt know anything i was acting horribly and he didnt know what to do with me but luckily they gave me a second chance i went on a diet and lost weight and now im in paris ive talked to other models and learned we all go through depression its the school of life
2801672 sometimes i take sedatives and other times energizers my stomach is ruined from all these diets but i have to keep in shape i hope i achieve everything ive set out to accomplish
2801673 it can drive her to suicide in ruslanas case im just lucky nothing like that has happened to me

2801677 we received dima in 2006 straight from the labor ward
2801678 his 18 year old mother signed a refusal of the child and disappeared its unclear where she is now she is a mentally disabled lonely young girl who was also raised in an orphanage
2801679 and although the boy was sweet it was likely this diagnose together with his background that frightened the russian couple but the harrisons agreed to adopt dima
2801680 i had a very good impression of the pair they were absolutely normal people who were ready to become parents and take care of their child
2801681 the boy was friendly calm and good natured and he wasnt capricious at all he was almost completely healthy when he was adopted
2801682 absolutely no one believes that ruslana could have done this
2801683 there were no adults who were closer to her than us here in new york we were something like her mother and father in the u s
2801684 this was really due to how ruslana was brought up
2801685 her mother was supposed to come visit from almaty the two lived together in an apartment but ruslana was a bit embarrassed because they were living together unmarried so she asked artem to move out
2801686 but there wasnt any way back although they always called and wrote each other they rarely met so in short they remained friends
2801687 my son had this tiny book ruslana had given him once they read the poems from there later he put the book in her coffin and his cross
2801688 in new york these escort services pay just as much as working the podium
2801689 i think its unlikely ruslana was involved in something like this
2801690 the reason why is korshunova was brought here omitting the moscow agencies her whole story was like straight out of a movie her friend convinced her to do a photo shoot for the cover of a local airline magazine the magazine wound up in the hands of the director of a leading modelling agency who was just leaving kazakhstan and at 15 she was already in new york conjectures about a moscow new york mafia using girls as escorts is out of place in her case
2801691 believe me she was fine in this regard the apartment she was renting in new york wasnt cheap ruslana had paid rent until the end of the year something like 40 000
2801692 she did have problems with her agent around one year ago
2801693 and ruslana asked us to help her out we called her agent and handled the negotiations but this had nothing to do with money ruslana simply wanted to change her agency but they wouldnt let her go but then everything solved itself

2801711 theyre buying real estate abroad and thats just the first step to emigration i think economic rehabilitation will help the situation all sectors need to flourish not only oil and gas ownership rights need to be protected and personal safety must be guaranteed combatting corruption and decreasing inflation is also important the prices are climbing and people have decided its pointless to have savings if it becomes possible to provide quality equal development then our middle class will remain patriotism is good but people want something more

2801781 this type of bulk buy would make an impact on the market they are in a unique position because they have a long time horizon to invest and a cheap cost of capital its actually a perfect time for them to acquire these reo assets

2801800 eight minor acts of physical discipline events against children were prosecuted with six yet to be resolved
2801801 the problem is that there is no statutory definition for either smacking or minor acts of physical discipline
2801802 so rather than call them smacking and draw attention they are simply being classified under this undefined category
2801803 it is concerning that the anti smacking law is being promoted as working by playing around with definitions and that so many families are being investigated for minor acts it is important to remember that there is still a definition of child assault and this is the category that we should be throwing the resources and weight of the law at
2801804 you know a law is a bad law when it fails to deal with the problem it was supposed to deal with while good families become the victims of it because nobody can accurately define what the law says or means

2801826 im bringing a fairly significant team were bringing out our motorcycle drill team which will be in this weekends parade in penticton on saturday well also have our ceremonial marching team a police dog and our 40 foot mobile recruiting office which is the first of its kind in canada after that were heading off to vernon where well be holding a recruitment presentation on monday at the prestige inn
2801827 last year we only had 300 applications were at a crossroads now in the past we would put an ad in the newspaper and we would get thousands of applications but that has changed with the economy at its highest and the unemployment rate at its lowest people have more choices
2801828 the ways of doing things in the past simply arent working were even using facebook and youtube which is a first for a major police department in canada
2801829 im afraid were on doorstep of a huge firestorm i think the government of canada needs to wake up to that fact and treat this as the emergency it truly represents
2801830 its a very dangerous situation its very critical and needs to be addressed on an emergency basis
2801831 i am on the free blogspot software but i notice everyone keeps mentioning wordpress could you talk more about this im thinking i should convert but wanted to keep my budget on this project as minimal as possible
2801832 i started my blog on wordpress com because i had heard great things about the wordpress platform and i wanted a free blog to write my thoughts i never intended to go beyond that actually i never intended to make blogging more than a very casual hobby and i certainly never intended to have actual readers who were interested in what i had to say but as i kept blogging i started to grow i had more and more visitors come to my site and interact and i became more and more a part of the personal finance community and that is where i started to hit the limitations of using the free wordpress com blog i lacked the freedom to customize to the extent i would like and make improvements i thought would be beneficial to both me and my readers so after a lot of deliberation i committed to actively growing my blog and switched to self hosting and i havent looked back since as well as giving me the freedom to customize and monetize and statisticize my blog being able to install wordpress plugins has really improved the overall functionality of the blog itself and allowed me to spend more time writing and thinking and less time tweaking
2801833 i never made the switch but hopefully the logic still applies
2801834 i asked for feedback from some more established bloggers about how i could improve my blog and one of them said that if i was really serious the best thing that i could do would be to switch to self hosted wordpress at that point id been blogging for 3 or so months and i was more confident that id be able to handle the back end stuff so i decided to go for it i remember thinking that it was awfully expensive compared to free at just over 100 for the year but since then ive more than made back what i put in through advertising and even if i hadnt made a penny from my blog it would still have been the best blogging decision ive made the ability to customise what im doing is probably the biggest thing and the fact that wordpress is ubiquitous means that there is plenty of support its really not as daunting as i first thought
2801835 i tried writing articles for two weeks on a free wordpress com blog that was private i used it to get a feel for blogging and how to link to other blogs i also made a goal to keep writing for 2 weeks since it usually takes 14 days to create a habit once i felt i was ready for my debut i purchased a domain and installed wordpress it was very easy to move all the articles over to my new site by spending some time upfront practicing once i started promoting my site i already had some planning and legwork done
2801836 i switched to wordpress com because i liked the look i could have stuck with blogger but it seemed less professional the comment page was particularly annoying wordpress com was good and i had my domain directed there for a while but you also couldnt really modify a lot of things like the code without paying extra for it i figured that if i was going to pay money to modify the code and such i might as well pay a bit more and do whatever i wanted id become very involved in my site and felt constantly thwarted by wordpress coms limitations self hosted wordpress lets you use add all sorts of tools plugins timed posting etc you can actually use scripts unlike wordpress com scripts including simple things like sitemeter and google analytics and wordpress com doesnt allow advertisers it seemed like my views traffic were getting pretty good and i might be able to make a bit of money more than enough to cover hosting if only i moved which was true im able to cover hosting and have so much control over my blog
2801837 kelowna reported a total rainfall of 8 5 millimeters there was some intense lightning we were recording a lightning strike across the okanagan every three to five seconds
2801838 there were reports of hail up to 20 millimeters in diameter reported in the penticton area the penticton airport recorded total rainfall of 45 6 millimeters thats a lot of rain to come down in a short amount of time
2801839 on our arrival we found fire in the basement area of the building there was heat damage to the basement area which was used for book storage and an office area and smoke damage to the rest of the building there was no structural damage and only contents were affected
2801840 there was no one occupying the building it was used as a church office building
2801841 it meant so much to our family that our fellow kelowna residents came out to support connor and canadian blood services
2801842 my son would not be where he is today if not for the blood donated by generous canadians and for that we are truly grateful
2801843 the support we received from the community throughout this blood drive was fantastic
2801844 this years dka mardi gras promises to be another successful event for us there are three stages of live entertainment throughout the day a huge kids zone street performers sidewalk sales and much more we have been working hard since last fall to make this an excellent day for families and our businesses alike
2801845 there is legislation that mandates that boaters have certain equipment on board to navigate in the dark that will have to be looked into to determine if there was any fault
2801846 there were flames coming from all parts of the house it was deemed at that time that it was unsafe to go inside so we fought it from the outside
2801847 there were two people here when we arrived a father and son the father suffered some minor burns i think they were trying to find their pets but we understand that all three dogs got out of the house
2801848 we did receive one unconfirmed report that they saw flames on the back porch so that might suggest that maybe a barbecue
2801849 we did find something in the garage and the rcmp are looking after that
2801850 then the fifth vehicle wasnt able to stop in time to avoid hitting the car in front of it and that was the first rear ender the sixth vehicle hit the fifth and that created the domino effect of one car rear ending another
2801851 i believe it was the forth and fifth vehicle which caught fire the fire department says it looks like the fuel pump in one of the vehicles got cracked during the crash and thats what started the fire
2801852 whats really amazing is no one was seriously hurt there are a few cases of whiplash but thats it there were four children in one of the vehicles which caught fire but they had all gotten out okay
2801853 drivers need to remember to leave more space between them and other vehicles so that when you come across blocked traffic you have time to stop

2801902 you dont get to do too much tackling out in the centres and generally when youre playing on the wing you just catch cold but it was fun and im excited to be playing rugby
2801903 i got a little bit too excited at one stage but it was just a good feeling being out there and playing
2801904 im a professional sportsman and i know what i need to do to get out there and perform to my best
2801905 ive just concentrated on what i have to do and thats learning the game learning what the team is trying to do and learning my role within the team
2801906 im fully focused im a rugby union player now and ive got goals that ive set so this is just the start hopefully to a long and successful rugby career
2801907 theres short term goals and theres long term goals like playing for the all blacks
2801908 i want to become a dominant no 13 and be considered one of the best centres going around in world rugby and i want to play for the all blacks one day but first i just want to play good footy i want to win the competition with toulon and repay the faith that tana has shown in me by getting out there and helping his team
2801909 one hundred per cent its a new game and a new challenge and i know ive got a lot to learn but im excited to be learning off one of the all time greats in tana umaga
2801910 i think if i am as committed as i was to playing rugby league and learning the game then the next two years will work out
2801911 i think probably a forward going into the forwards would be a lot more difficult because theres a lot of things that are different
2801912 in the backs its still hard because of all the technical things its not as easy as people think
2801913 its just all the little things i have to pick up the rucks the positional play the calls and the moves

2801973 we dont want songs running through heads outside the show we dont want to be waking up in the morning and by mistake start singing phantom of the opera in the shower and ive never had that
2801974 when the show started the melodies were constantly going through my head
2801975 and i would wake up in the middle of the night and hear some tunes my son loved the music so much it was playing on the radio every time i came home i had to ask him not to play it but then after a few weeks i got to the point where if somebody asked me to sing something from the show i couldnt do it somehow my brain just repressed it
2801976 ive always had nightmares of not being able to get to the theatre being stuck somewhere or harp breaks

2801978 its a wonderfully written harp part theres one little chord i have the audience would never know the difference but there are nights where i arpeggiate the chord exactly right there are places all through the show where i really am satisfied if i play it the way i like to play it
2801979 i know in my body when im supposed to be playing when im not playing i read books i study languages and when i pick up the instrument again its a little like tourettes syndrome i drop the book and blat out a few notes on trumpet and pick up the book again

2801984 there is a general perception amongst the public that the art of filmmaking these days belongs to wall street and major studios with giant budgets but the fact of the matter is that you really do not need millions of dollars to make an independent film you can make a movie for a fraction of what most hollywood films cost if the right people and film production methods are employed however if you want to make a quality low budget movie you must immerse yourself in the world of independent filmmakers

2802235 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2802236 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2802237 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2802238 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2802239 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
2802240 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq

2802246 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2802247 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2802248 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2802249 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2802250 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2802251 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2802252 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2802253 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2802254 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2802255 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2802256 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2802257 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2802258 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2802259 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2802260 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2802261 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2802262 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2802263 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2802264 he was just so alive i cant believe hes gone
2802265 it was such a popular show because of his bigger than life persona
2802266 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2802267 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2802268 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2802269 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2802270 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2802271 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2802272 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2802273 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2802274 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2802275 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2802276 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2802277 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2802278 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2802279 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2802280 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2802281 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2802282 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2802283 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2802284 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2802285 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2802286 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2802287 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2802288 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2802289 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2802290 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2802291 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2802292 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

2802303 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2802304 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2802305 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2802306 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2802307 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2802308 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2802309 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2802310 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2802311 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

2802316 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2802317 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2802318 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2802319 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2802320 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
2802321 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
2802322 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
2802323 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
2802324 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2802325 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

2802348 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2802349 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2802350 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2802351 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2802352 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2802353 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2802354 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2802355 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2802356 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

2802387 die verpackung interessiert kleine kinder am meisten der inhalt wird am anfang oft gar nicht konsumiert mit der zeit aber gew hnen sie sich auch daran

2802389 wenn eltern ein produkt sehen das bestimmte n hrstoffangaben macht k nnten sie annehmen dass das lebensmittel n hrstoffreich ist

2802407 thats kind of been weighing on me the most since ive been here just the fact that i still have this in my body and there is still some risk to it the doctors have told me ill be fine ill be cured of it but i just want to hurry up and be done with it already
2802408 it does take away a little bit from this experience
2802409 ive just tried to minimize it as much as i can i dont want to think about it and i dont want to dwell on it but sometimes thats hard because its such a big deal

2802413 we were trying to figure out why he was being so coy and turning up to training late
2802414 there were many rumors floating around we started most of them
2802415 the olympics look a lot smaller when youre dealing with something like cancer
2802416 it gives us an idea that what were doing here isnt as high on the pedestal as we sometimes put it on were going to be behind him every step of the way it doesnt end here
2802417 im really happy i did that it was one of the best experiences for a sporting event ive ever been to in my life

2802427 but his goal was to swim at the olympic games and hes excited were all supporting each other in everything we do
2802428 we were trying to figure out why he was being so coy and turning up to training late
2802429 there were many rumors floating around we started most of them
2802430 the olympics look a lot smaller when youre dealing with something like cancer
2802431 it gives us an idea that what were doing here isnt as high on the pedestal as we sometimes put it on were going to be behind him every step of the way it doesnt end here
2802432 im really happy i did that it was one of the best experiences for a sporting event ive ever been to in my life
2802433 the coaches were worried about us being on our feet being hot but i dont care that was something i always wanted to do if i ever made the team

2802486 right now i think its unrealistic to ask any of those kids to come in and take over where michael and garrett and tyler left off
2802487 but thats the burden of college football youre going to have years where youre stronger in certain areas than you are in others
2802488 each one of these kids that weve brought in has the potential to be what those other kids were as to how quickly they will realize it i dont know its difficult to ask any freshman regardless of position to show up and contribute immediately at this level and its even more difficult when youre asking them to contribute as the starter
2802489 but i have no doubt that bryan shields can take over for garrett and i feel confident that i can step in and do the things that michael hughes did

2802503 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2802504 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2802505 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2802506 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2802507 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2802508 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2802509 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2802510 new reel layout 60 lines for 30 credits and fast play drive hyper volatile math model
2802511 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2802528 i cant say i was ever lost but i was bewildered once for three days
2802529 our tendency is to try things out capriciously without an in depth grasp of their underlying foundation and without the commitment necessary to sustain them when a new idea fails we give up instead of investigating the causes of failure and addressing them systematically
2802530 i have some good news and some bad news the bad news is were lost the good news is were making great time
2802531 lets not forget how much work weve moved through our sector in the last year
2802532 you ought to improve in these areas but i am too busy already skilled enough or have more important things to do

2802540 now that ive gotten a taste of it i dont know i guess i may have to negotiate a little bit with my husband

2802542 im looking forward to being a mom and a wife and a business owner
2802543 that was a really important visit im pretty sure i wouldnt have been as focused today had i had that moment with them yesterday
2802544 ive been a pretty selfish mom and a very unselfish athlete for about three years now and its time to put my family first its probably time to move on
2802545 these results show its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
2802546 its not often you see studies where they have managed to improve function in this way
2802547 what they seem to have managed is to maintain the mice at this young stage and both restore and maintain normal activity
2802548 as we age we have an increase in protein misfolding and general faults in protein processing so the ability to maintain an effective system to clear these would be beneficial

2802564 every soldier and officer should absolutely disobey any order to kill muslims or aid their killers
2802565 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2802566 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2802567 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2802568 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2802569 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2802570 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2802571 i would be very direct with russian president vladimir putin that these actions will have consequences long term in terms of our relationship with russia and it is in violation of the norms of international conduct
2802572 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately
2802573 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
2802574 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure

2802585 diaby will not be available for the start of the season
2802586 so we will have to work on some things which i saw on friday night against ajax it worked well with denilson and fabregas
2802587 you cannot say after just one match you need a run of games to see if it the partnership will work but i am confident it will
2802588 cesc has worked very hard since he has come back
2802589 you cannot say he will be at his best but he will be fit enough
2802590 to win big trophies makes you more confident and gives you something you can pass on to the team around you
2802591 at 21 he already has a lot of experience he is an intelligent boy but i would not like to put too much pressure on him
2802592 we know every single player in his area is very important
2802593 cesc in midfield is a player now who has maybe more experience than the others
2802594 we are a body short but it is not necessarily to play alongside cesc he can play alongside anybody
2802595 we try to find the right player my target is always to spend the right money on the right player therefore the timing of your buy is also important as well
2802596 i do not know yet if it will be with the swiss or somebody else but it is
2802597 do not forget we have diaby who is not available and alex song who

2802602 my dad and i both loved football and we shared the passion for the game and for me playing when he passed away i didnt want to play anymore
2802603 it has been kind of weird having them follow me around but i know that this will help take me to the next level in my career as a fighter
2802604 they always come up with a great game plan and it always works
2802605 tom and matt are there for me 100 percent they have helped me to develop not only as a fighter but as and individual as well
2802606 this win was a big stepping stone for me i moved up in the rankings but winning was better than the rankings a main goal of mine was achieved with this win
2802607 i love it i have a new outlook on training and my confidence is much stronger than it was three years ago
2802608 my coaches at usmma have taught me to be in great shape and that is what makes the difference in the fight if you get tired first youll lose

2802611 its just sad that it took all this time for them to take action and work on the infractions that the schools had and for this to happen for any school to not open on time is just preposterous its just ridiculous

2802647 because of the sheer volume that is on the market the people who want to sell quicker need to drop their prices to be more competitive
2802648 the ones that are most motivated will drop the most so there are some good buys out there

2802697 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2802698 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2802699 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2802700 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2802701 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2802702 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2802703 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2802704 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2802705 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2802706 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2802707 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2802708 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2802709 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2802710 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2802711 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2802712 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2802713 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2802714 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2802715 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2802716 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2802717 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2802718 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2802719 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2802720 estoy contento con la sesi n de hoy estoy libre de lesiones sin dolor
2802721 bernie mac just say what you want to say but cant
2802722 you were on air force one and you couldnt stop to pick up the kids
2802723 i couldnt ask for a better place to be honestly
2802724 i would hate to see our teachers and classrooms lose out on money because the state doesnt have enough revenue
2802725 weve given them the benefit of the doubt for a long time
2802726 a sales tax free weekend will be welcomed more than ever in this tough economy especially with the high prices of food and fuel
2802727 it is certainly worth it when you consider the positive impact on retail sales and consumer confidence
2802728 theres just something about a sales tax holiday thats different from a regular sale
2802729 there are a lot of families out there struggling to make ends meet and theyre having to stretch their dollars
2802730 while the 5 percent or so savings doesnt sound like a lot that could be a make or break

2802741 i need to call my mom and have her tape espn mangold said with a chuckle
2802742 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
2802743 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2802744 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2802745 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
2802746 theres going to be an adjustment for us cotchery said

2802753 obama has criticized bush for his fiscal irresponsibility and now hes using bushs baseline as a yardstick by which to measure fiscal responsibility

2802755 im not downplaying this race by any means but i have to put that race behind me
2802756 i have to act like it never happened because i have so many tough races ahead of me

2802760 the cheerleaders are called baobei in chinese which literally means babies or babes these babies are required to show their passion energy and openness for example chinese beach volleyball babies shatan baobei are demanded to wear bikinis to dance in front of audiences in order to show their healthiness they have also been asked to bathe in the sun in order to get a darker skin which goes against the chinese notion of female beauty one girl stated that they understood that they were playing an important role for the beach volleyball and they were there to give the audiences most of them chinese an enjoyable viewing experience

2802762 baptismal the archbishop of canterbury concluding presidential address to the lambeth conference 2008
2802763 a hymn a lesson a revelation a tongue or an interpretation
2802764 we are one with one another because we are called into union with the one christ and stand in his unique place stand in the way the truth and the life our unity is not mutual forbearance but being summoned and drawn into the same place before the fathers throne
2802765 seek for consistent practices around the sacraments so that the baptism or eucharist of each community can be recognised by others as directed in the same way working under the same authority
2802766 to change what has been received in faith from scripture and tradition
2802767 the practice and public language of the church acts always as a reminder that the onus of proof is on those who seek a new understanding
2802768 charitys power as an ensign to the nations is severely undermined and the archbishops later discussion of zimbabwes anglican witness as bound to the communions life was in this respect far more than a passing example permit and even further confusion and the calling of the gospel is ripped from the hands of the little ones for whom the kingdom is given
2802769 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
2802770 some good positive leadership traits and habits kellye and i have seen bad leaders and now were ready to model good behaviors for these interns

2802772 i understand that hes causing a lot of problems for jann on her project and he was one of those associates that we refused to make partner because of his behavior
2802773 really i though yall turned him down because he lost that 300 million project with wild west medical center
2802774 we wouldnt penalize someone for something like that we told him that we didnt want him as a partner when he tried to buy in because his behavior was
2802775 we didnt believe that fit in with the da culture the kind of insults and fits he used to have we saw it pixie we saw all his behavior the code book throwing the shouting and we could tell he wasnt the kind of person we wanted to guide da into the 21st century
2802776 and can i thank you for not promoting him which made him leave because i was ready to quit architecture while working for him not da architecture
2802777 i was just an intern and the economy was in the toilet you could replace me in a second so why complain
2802778 because we need to know when somethings that messed up

2802803 because an ark with ghosts pouring out or a cup that grants eternal life is so realistic
2802804 i liked moonlight and i think we started to get into it we started to come into our own in the last four episodes and i started to get what they wanted from my character i was able to do certain episodes with that in mind and i felt great about those
2802805 i think our fans are a bit different maybe because the shows that we do are kind of story oriented character and emotion driven and people who wind up watching those shows are a bit different fans come and they get interested in the story in the character the emotions of the story and i think its cool to come talk about that
2802806 im a big star wars fan i loved those i remember getting out of the theater and trying to hold the walls up with my will power very exciting
2802807 we kind of all sort of grew up together because we were all actors that werent really working this was all our first big break
2802808 everyone was determined about the work and to make it good so it was just an awesome environment
2802809 deep impact was like two lines but it was the funniest lines in the movie remember that long hair pimples
2802810 and it was awesome i went to prom with this one pointing to his wife and high school sweetheart lauren and i was the coolest guy in school because i was in this huge blockbuster film even if it was only two lines
2802811 i play golf so whats the worst that can happen i get hit by a ball or i get hit by lightning right i think lee trevino survived like three strikes so i got a couple of times in me
2802812 i think we would do that but right now were auditioning and trying to get other work so lets do it soon
2802813 more recently since ive been done with moonlight ive sorted some stuff out in my career just personally about where i want to go i think im going to wind up doing some leading type stuff and then i might go back to some character type stuff
2802814 i think that i worked out a couple things for myself kind of what i want to create in the world with being a celebrity it was like all of a sudden i realized i could do it and i was like excited to try to do that be a leading man and i saw the amount of good that you can do that you can use that platform to effect change in the world and that was exciting to me
2802815 basically i love just creating something from nothing the ideas that you put into things its almost like writing in a way because youre writing your own character additional things or additional ideas that youve seen from your own life that you want to put in this character or these emotions
2802816 i dont want to work just to work particularly anymore
2802817 id rather find something im happy with and create something cool for people to see and id rather look for something like that
2802818 but here you get someone who may not come out of their basement all year but here they are social they find acceptance and something they love
2802819 these guys come and you get to meet like minded people and thats one of the better qualities about these is you get to sit around and talk with friends and people who are interested in similar things
2802820 but they havent told us anything so right now were auditioning and trying to get other work so lets do it soon
2802821 for the first kiss i was unconscious that was probably the most nerve racking its a scene where he kisses me and i was revived after being thrown across the hub i close my eyes and it was a kiss not a snog at the end of the season series two episode three and by that stage i was snogging that was only one take
2802822 i was terrified but within a day you relax because he is such a big character touching everyone up all the time
2802823 in situations where you dont expect barrowman will do a prat take or try to throw you making faces or getting his bollocks out in the way when youre in a very tight close up and you expect him to make everyone laugh it makes you a little bit terrified when you have to do scenes where you have to kiss him but those are the scenes where hes pretty well behaved
2802824 i was nervous during the first kissing scene i was very very nervous but he was very professional i kept waiting for him to do something like grab my ass but he didnt
2802825 i think the attitude of both the shows is that the mindset is that sexuality is no longer an issue
2802826 thats what the whole thing was trying to project there should be no controversy
2802827 it was their decision by burn and naoko to tell us we all were shocked it came out of nowhere it was just as surprising to us as it was to the fans the emotions at the end were very real

2802840 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali
2802841 oh just the prospect of a larger regional war that could drag in russia
2802842 thousands are fleeing south ossetia to the russian region of north ossetia alania the united nations reported friday
2802843 the first u s aid came under the rubric of the georgia train and equip program
2802844 nathan hodge should be ashamed of this post and his righteous outrage at the us for helping georgia without american arms and trainings what chance at all would the georgians have at resisting russian pressure and invasion none
2802845 ghost recon begins in 2008 with civil unrest in russia ultra nationalists have seized power in russia with plans to rebuild the government their first step is clandestine support of rebel factions in georgia and the baltic states this is where the ghosts come in to silence the invasion armed with some of the most advanced weaponry in the world the soldiers of the ghost recon force are covertly inserted into area of operations and given specific missions to curtail the rebel actions and overthrow their benefactors
2802846 us is trying to help a tiny country continue on towards democracy
2802847 you dont just fire up a bunch of heavy tanks and artillery and drive them down a random road and expect them to get there
2802848 nathan what will history say about a people who have been so rude assumed they have a right to self determination away from moscow

2802852 every day and every moment it is more and more difficult to get the information
2802853 it is dangerous to want a free press in russia
2802854 georgia returned the favor committing thousands of troops to the multi national coalition in iraq last fall the georgians doubled their contingent making them the third largest contributor to the coalition
2802855 they dont care about the ossetians all they see is the pipelines running across georgia and the oil under the ground
2802856 hey guys leave your homes and lets go to russia oh you dont want to well its a pity

2802858 when you discuss security issues if you are telling the truth that should be something protected at the core of the first amendment
2802859 if you are truthfully telling the world about a dangerous situation and it is a situation which is dangerous not because the security researcher exposes the vulnerability but because the person who made the product made the vulnerability then this should be core speech
2802860 knowingly causes the transmission of a program information code or command to a computer or computer system
2802861 the statute on its face appears to be discussing sending code or similar types of information to a computer
2802862 it does not appear to contemplate somebody who is giving a talk to humans nevertheless the court believed that the act of giving a presentation to a group of humans was covered by the computer fraud computer intrusion statute we believe this is wrong
2802863 basically what the court is suggesting here is that giving a presentation involving security to other security researchers is a violation of federal law
2802864 as far as i know this is completely unprecedented and it has a tremendous chilling effect on sharing this sort of research and we intend to fight it with everything weve got

2802882 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2802883 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2802884 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2802885 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2802886 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2802887 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2802888 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2802889 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2802890 we are working to develop new products that contain technologies that our competition will not be able to match i cannot discuss these new products but we are very confident in our product pipeline

2802975 explain to the mothers and fathers of american servicemen that may come home in body bags why their son or daughter have to give up their life
2802976 the president is once again releasing american military might on a foreign country with an ill defined objective and no exit strategy he has yet to tell the congress how much this operation will cost and he has not informed our nations armed forces about how long they will be away from home these strikes do not make for a sound foreign policy
2802977 if we are going to commit american troops we must be certain they have a clear mission an achievable goal and an exit strategy
2802978 i had doubts about the bombing campaign from the beginning i didnt think we had done enough in the diplomatic area
2802979 i cannot support a failed foreign policy history teaches us that it is often easier to make war than peace this administration is just learning that lesson right now the president began this mission with very vague objectives and lots of unanswered questions a month later these questions are still unanswered there are no clarified rules of engagement there is no timetable there is no legitimate definition of victory there is no contingency plan for mission creep there is no clear funding program there is no agenda to bolster our over extended military there is no explanation defining what vital national interests are at stake there was no strategic plan for war when the president started this thing and there still is no plan today
2802980 no goal no objective not until we have those things and a compelling case is made then i say back out of it because innocent people are going to die for nothing thats why im against it

2803026 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2803027 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2803028 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2803029 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2803030 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2803031 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2803032 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2803033 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2803043 the fccs bipartisan decision to punish comcast is a major victory defying every ounce of conventional wisdom in washington everyday people have taken on a major corporation and won an historic precedent for an open internet
2803044 comcasts history of deception and continued blocking show contempt for the online consumer protections established by the fcc
2803045 todays order makes it clear that there is nothing reasonable about restricting access to online content or technologies moving forward this bellwether case will send a strong signal to cable and phone companies that such violations will not be tolerated
2803046 but the fight is far from over a duopoly market where phone and cable companies control nearly 99 percent of high speed connections will not discipline itself we look forward to working with the fcc and congress to ensure proactive measures keep the internet open and free of discrimination and accessible to all americans

2803170 this robot is a lie detector now tell us where you really were after school
2803171 i am sorry i lied we really watched a tape called sex queen
2803172 when i was your age i never lied to my parents
2803173 three thousand against one thats not very fair you can do better than that cant you you f ing mugs
2803174 no one had been allowed in by the time we were due to go on we ended up playing for our mates backstage it was a shame but the festival has a strict timetable
2803175 hes a walking miracle im so lucky to have him and im convinced its because he knows neil lennon
2803176 neil visited the hospital several times he said footballers who get badly injured worry theyll never play again but they have to keep a positive mental attitude
2803177 he also told anton that one day he could play for celtic it really did inspire him hearing those stories impressed on anton the importance of never giving up and we are eternally grateful
2803178 it was completely and utterly horrific wee anton had been in so much pain with the chemotherapy
2803179 i feared his body couldnt cope but hed tell me not to worry he was more bothered about seeing power rangers on tv
2803180 i was crying before it but anton said relax theyll give me painkillers i couldnt believe it
2803181 my son is a massive celtic fan and was over the moon neil told him what it was like to play in the 2003 uefa cup final in seville and over the next few weeks came back to visit a few times
2803182 hed tell the kids to keep fighting for their dreams regardless of their problems it was very moving he was the best psychologist my son could have had
2803183 phil was in great humour you could tell he was a real family man he was loving my wee boys banter
2803184 its all his idea weve auctioned signed celtic and rangers tops and asked local companies for donations
2803185 antons fantastic now there are a few things he cant do like ride a bike but hes just like any other wee boy his age

2803187 few folk realise how much time barry devotes to charity
2803188 a lot of good causes would be a lot poorer if he wasnt on the scene
2803189 every day after training he goes through the paperwork to see if theres anything he can do to help
2803190 its an honour to be nominated i am delighted to help in any way i can
2803191 this is exactly what our communities need a platform for people to have their concerns heard
2803192 we cannot sit back and allow thugs to ruin our streets people have to be confident that the police are strong enough to tackle the problems we face
2803193 i was in asda in february getting flowers for my grans grave i went to the toilet and there was a girl in front of me when i tried to get past
2803194 her eyes are evil pure evil i have only ever seen her when she is absolutely off her face
2803195 she broke my thumb dislocated my knee and slashed my legs
2803196 i was told i was going to get the same as scott for the sake of my family we have to go
2803197 i gave evidence against scotts killers because it was the right thing to do and it was worth it to see them jailed but the strain has been overwhelming
2803198 society needs folk to stand up and be counted ive done my bit i cant do it again my family should not be put through any more
2803199 mikes new job is due to start in a few weeks and we need to get it sorted before then
2803200 the criminal justice system depends on people having the courage to give evidence
2803201 if one of them is subjected to harassment the police and other associated agencies work together to ensure they are protected
2803202 from my experience there is still work to be done if people are prepared to stand up and be counted they must be afforded proper protection
2803203 i hope that save our streets answers the questions that need to be asked
2803204 our daughter still hasnt got over it but she is trying
2803205 a campaign like this is so worthwhile and we will definitely be there to share our experiences
2803206 i dated him and he sneered that dance halls were dens of iniquity
2803207 we had five dates in glasgow one to the majestic ballroom two at a restaurant and one each at a caf and cinema in the city
2803208 when we were out he never mentioned the bible john killings but he spoke about women going to the dancing on their own leaving their kids behind
2803209 without mentioning the killings he said these women deserve all they get i felt that was no way to speak and pointed out he did not know their circumstances and women who went to dance halls may have done so with their husbands blessing
2803210 when he spoke about it he seemed to get agitated and on his high horse it was chilling
2803211 he drove a big dark motor with a highly polished walnut dashboard it was spotless and always polished
2803212 he may talk of a strict religious upbringing with a severe parental attitude towards drink and references to the bible
2803213 i was told to go home and forget it and that the killer was john mcinnes of course this was not the case
2803214 im taking care of all of them im getting a shooter im sick of people f g with me
2803215 kenny is completely out of control hes absolutely raging and is desperate for money
2803216 he told me hed ordered a gun and that he was going to shoot all the people whove crossed him since hes been back in edinburgh
2803217 he said hed ordered a 9mm pistol with two clips and a silencer from a gang in liverpool he said all he had to do in return for the gun was help them out with a job
2803218 he said he wanted to get his own back on people im terrified of what will happen if he gets his hands on this gun hes losing the plot and my biggest fear is hell go about shooting any random person he doesnt like the look of
2803219 this lot kennys got in with are dangerous but he seems to think nothing of getting involved all he cares about is getting his hands on this gun
2803220 richeys told me theyre planning bank jobs and stuff he also mentioned he wants to raid the post office just 100 yards from his flat he said hes desperate for money and hell do anything
2803221 it was supposed to come on wednesday im expecting it this week i dont know if theyre f g with me
2803222 kenny told me he put a t shirt round his face like a ninja turtle and then whacked him over the head with a baton he said his friend gave him an alibi and no one witnessed the attack
2803223 his landlords told him if theres one more incident of police coming round smashing doors in hes out
2803224 brians not to be trusted i was winding his a e up
2803225 somebody has to stop him before he goes too far
2803226 the way hes carrying on with the haircut and talk about guns and shooting folk its almost as though hes trying to be bickle its sad
2803227 she smashed up five cars in our street a couple of weeks ago and i decided to call the police myself
2803228 i wanted her charged and punished properly but instead she was sent to the childrens panel and given a slap on the wrists
2803229 now ive thrown her out of the house she must learn her behaviour isnt right but i wish she could have been properly punished
2803230 parents have to take responsibility all too often children believe they can do what they like and get away with it
2803231 we could start to solve the problems in society by stopping children from having too much freedom
2803232 my biggest concern is kids carrying knives where do they get them from and why arent parents doing more to stop it
2803233 people are going around with telescopic batons in their cars there are gangs of kids roaming the streets so they feel they have to have some way of protecting themselves and their families
2803234 i reported a drug deal i saw going on in broad daylight it took the police two hours to attend and by then it was all over
2803235 shes an old woman of 78 and shes heard too many stories of nothing being done in these cases she feels shed be worse off
2803236 they were a great help and really managed to reach out to some of the kids they were visible on the streets and people were happy to talk to them it was a vital service
2803237 things have gone downhill since they went we all miss them
2803238 the community wardens scheme was unique and a good model for the rest of the country
2803239 we want to have a high visibility in places like torry but that is difficult well never have enough officers at the weekends the majority of our resources are directed to the city centre where we are needed
2803240 the police need higher visibility its the only way to send out the right message to would be criminals
2803241 the issue is one of resources we should be ploughing money into more police on the streets rather than increasing the prison population
2803242 id like to see us trying to tackle the reasons why things have gone wrong in the first place
2803243 ive got eight kids and ive had problems with one of my sons and drugs ive learned they need to be nurtured and shown the right way
2803244 the issue is one of education we should get kids involved in local initiatives
2803245 there is no doubt this is connected to the murder of kriss racial tensions have reached boiling point recently and it will probably only get worse
2803246 the area would have been busy and i would appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward
2803247 you look like the kind of guy who hangs around parks murdering women the cops got the wrong guy for moira it was him
2803248 six weeks ago i couldnt have got away with that times obviously a good healer well maybe not that good shes still dead
2803249 you could have heard a pin drop we were disgusted it was sick crass and in very poor taste the guy is an utter idiot how he got off stage without being battered is a miracle
2803250 its despicable and not funny he took bad taste to new depths
2803251 i dont see why people should know her name all i know is shes the one
2803252 shes perfect for me who knows we may even marry
2803253 she was at the festival with me last year and shell be with me this year what more could i want
2803254 she is slightly younger than me but more mature were both adopted which is nice
2803255 i am very happy with her i can see my life with her she still cant get the hang of what cup to use for what drink but once my training is complete i foresee a long future with her i feel very settled shes wonderful
2803256 ive always been a my take on how difficult life is kind of comic
2803257 i was harder years ago i was certainly very unhappy so things were about how futile everything is and how hard relationships are whereas now i am a bit softer and lighter
2803258 i wish i could remember what material i used to do but my memory has been eroded by drink and drugs
2803259 i never used to drink before performing but id get absolutely wasted for the rest of the time throughout the festival it was what all the comics used to do get drunk and coked up and party 24 seven
2803260 now i get to enjoy the festival i see other comics and plays with my partner i realise what i was missing out on
2803261 im sick of talking about that f g jungle ive got other things that im focusing on
2803262 my work is important to me its great to be doing stand up again i look on it as an art its a performance
2803263 i have been through psychoanalysis and beaten drink problems its good to come out the other side
2803264 she was like a wild animal bashing the bar worker with her stiletto
2803265 she wouldnt stop even though blood was gushing out of the girls head
2803266 she was being really loud and started taking her clothes off and flashing her boobs among other things
2803267 as rachel turned away lee lunged at her with her stiletto shoe and started smashing her in the back of the head
2803268 she was crazed she punched him smack in the face sending him reeling and then spat at him
2803269 she was boasting telling everyone how blood was gushing from the girls head
2803270 she kept banging on about being a glamour model but everyone thought she had a face like a back end of a bus
2803271 i know everything about him ill sell my story for 20 000
2803272 one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid
2803273 we are in the business of gymnastics and we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like you dont have to be a gymnastics coach to know what they look like at 16
2803274 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family the patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity
2803275 we have come here today to speak out against the human rights abuses of the chinese government
2803276 we have come here today to be a voice to those who are in prison because of their religious beliefs we are here to peacefully pray
2803277 we didnt do anything wrong we were speaking up for the chinese people we refused to pay
2803278 lets face it china doesnt have a very good record on human rights its very troubling when you dont hear from someone in 24 hours
2803279 we pray that this oppressive government will perhaps recognize through this incident that their own citizens deserve to have the basic human rights of free speech freedom to worship according to the dictates of their own conscience as well as the protection of the weakest members of society their precious unborn children
2803280 i say china the eyes of the world are upon you if you want the respect and acceptance of other nations at this critical time during the olympics afford your own wonderful people the human rights they have been yearning for
2803281 its true that the number of infections is declining but consider this if the world can be satisfied with 2 7 million people infected per year 7 500 per day then im not sure where the standards are for declaring something a total disaster what i see is that we are making progress through combination prevention but in order to stop the epidemic theres no doubt that well need a vaccine
2803282 there is no greater tool to end aids than a preventive vaccine
2803283 even in a country like the u s with significant resources and education dedicated to prevention were still losing the battle against aids especially among certain high risk populations
2803284 the bottom line is that we need a long term solution to this epidemic we need a vaccine if we are to turn the tide on aids
2803285 its clear 25 years after the discovery of the virus that were on a long journey and its not going to be a straight line thats why i think that the
2803286 said dr alan bernstein executive director of the global hiv vaccine enterprise
2803287 divide up the mission into a set of interim milestones this is a way to measure progress to hold people accountable
2803288 the second recommendation is a practical one we have to trim and significantly improve the pipeline we believe that the 30 odd candidates in the pipeline should be trimmed based on their probability of success resources from these candidates should be re directed instead towards solving the biggest challenges facing researchers today
2803289 to move the aids vaccine field forward we have to sustain the effort we need a new cadre of young researchers we need stable and predictable financing that is flexible
2803290 failure is a momentary setback on the road to success
2803291 developing a vaccine may take more time and innovation than we once imagined but we are confident that science will prevail
2803292 scientists and those who support their work private corporations and governments alike should redouble their commitments
2803293 the challenges are huge but i have no doubt that we will live in a world without hiv some day
2803294 nearly all of us in this room were born into a world without aids we owe it to future generations to work to leave them a world without aids
2803295 we were here a few weeks ago and there were a lot of jellyfish we didnt even go in the water it was horrible
2803296 but now theyre were getting the frequency of them a lot more weve had some of them that were just so tremendous that we have to come and pick off the beach
2803297 during the recent new york city triathlon thousands of competitors were stung by jellyfish in the hudson river

2803305 i havent been this anxious to play a basketball game since i was like a kid i couldnt sleep i didnt even rest today i was up the whole day just thinking about the game it takes you to walk out on the court to feel it it couldnt get no bigger than this
2803306 theyve lied to us in the past and spent a lot of money on its military budget that can help the poor in our country and help feed others in less fortunate areas
2803307 russia had to move in if only to save face
2803308 should russia confine its efforts to south ossetia it still might emerge out of this mess as the power who moved in to stop bloodshed
2803309 should russia move further into georgia it will be deemed the aggressor

2803330 the traffic that comes to defcons public ip address takes a jog through new york
2803331 essentially we see every single data gram coming down the wire before it gets here so that means we have a chance to edit it
2803332 you could not stop it until the hijacked route is removed from everybodys table
2803333 its very non obvious to novice users if youre an expert user you might see something
2803334 the other assumptions were that if you were to track the traffic you could tunnel it back there or coordinate with the endpoint somehow to coordinate with the endpoint to soak up all the data they were expecting and transport it around the effects of your hijack
2803335 the ultimate goal is to kind of guilt trip the idiot providers

2803370 a week without common sense political thought was making me feel lower than a snakes belly in a wagon rut
2803371 dana troglodyte misogynist obsessive a complete loser every time i pick on him no matter how nasty a person he is i feel bad because he is after all a loser

2803384 fear ruins the ride skateboard stunts must be performed with no fear but having no fear without a foundation of experience and knowledge is stupid
2803385 the aim is to stop off at crafters and makers along the way and take photos of the work we see and put it onto the travel diary on our web site and blog as we go along
2803386 we want to visit as many crafters as we can during the tour we dont really have a timescale but think it could take anywhere up to a month we asked around and have got the use of a classic vw camper van for the duration we have our laptop and our plastic cutlery and are ready to go
2803387 we are securing a lot of publicity for this not only will crafters know about it but consumers and members of the public will hear about the tour via their local newspapers radio stations and other web sites and media outlets
2803388 we will gladly drop by where we are invited by crafters if someone wants to show us their work then we will certainly consider stopping off we will come round take some pictures have a chat about their work and add it to our web site
2803389 era diventato assillante mi chiedeva di continuo delle fotografie e io non ho pensato alle conseguenze cos le ho scattate con il cellulare poi lui le ha messe in rete

2803395 as an asian im proud of the success of the opening ceremony
2803396 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2803397 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2803398 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2803399 i saw lochte was going slower and i tried to do everything to go better than phelps but i dont have enough power for that
2803400 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2803401 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2803402 one of the reason for my return is that the olympic games will be held in my own country for the first time that really motivated me
2803403 i am always confident of japanese judo and my success today will send a message to the world that japan is still strong in judo
2803404 we have already changed ip for the website that makes it work for half the isps again
2803405 there are a significant number of vendors who have mounting pressure on them to meet the market as mortgage repayments on top of increased costs of living start to bite
2803406 this change of position reflects a greater understanding and acceptance of the property market and the wider economy
2803407 there are many examples of significant losses being realised currently
2803408 because of the sheer volume that is on the market the people who want to sell quicker need to drop their prices to be more competitive
2803409 the ones that are most motivated will drop the most so there are some good buys out there
2803410 ive just sold a home for about 50 000 less i sold it for 492 000 last year
2803411 anybody that doesnt need to sell is probably not in this market i would say
2803412 i get nervous because its game time you can get as much as you put in
2803413 i think people would look at this and say wow an indian film exotic location it looks really interesting why dont we go see what this is about and then you find its about you
2803414 i think when youre in a place that does seem exotic youre willing to suspend your disbelief a bit more

2803420 thats actually how i learn some of my spanish by watching the buffy reruns which are dubbed in spanish
2803421 i can understand spanish really well but i have trouble communicating i dont know how to structure the sentences so i found that by watching stuff that i knew its an easier way to work on the language

2803428 the court ordered defendants to stop enforcing an unconstitutional law and allow day laborers to express their willingness to work by peaceably standing on the side of the road
2803429 the constitution protects everyone in this country and todays final ruling is a victory for the free speech rights not only of day laborers but of everyone in the town of cave creek
2803430 across the country courts have found that these local anti solicitation ordinances which are merely pretext for targeting day laborers and other latinos dont pass constitutional muster
2803431 before other states and local municipalities consider passing similar discriminatory and unlawful ordinances they should remember that these laws will fail under legal scrutiny and open them up to costly litigation
2803432 the courts have continually found that day laborers and others who wish to exercise their first amendment right to solicit employment in public places have the right to do so without fear that they will be discriminated against simply because of the color of their skin or because they are perceived to be foreign born

2803436 he spends more than what we got for bostock every year on his academy so for him to get it thrown back in his face makes you wonder why you bother
2803437 our aim this season is to finish as high as we can for him and make it a proposition that somebody wants to come in and buy
2803438 they are good enough but theyve got to be a little bit more selfish more clever
2803439 we look to play the beautiful game and get through teams with silky football
2803440 but even the european champions spain used route one against sweden for david villa to score the important thing is that theres a guy on the end of it with quality
2803441 its good to take the win at last ive been confident all weekend and was so disappointed by the problems we had in the first race
2803442 there is talk of second year syndrome after going so close last season but we have tried to draw a line under what happened in the play offs
2803443 we will be looking at hull this season thinking we could have been playing the teams that they will be playing but it has just made us more determined to go one better
2803444 i would have liked to see michael put the laces through it
2803445 we had a meeting yesterday with the gaffer and he told us that the fans would roar us on if we did well and if not we would have a very bad season
2803446 we have to give 200 per cent for the fans because there are 50 000 in every game at ibrox that inspired us now we have won our first game and that is a big help
2803447 i was surprised because falkirk have a very good team they play good football
2803448 of course european football was a big reason for me coming here i saw the final last year and i knew that there would be the chance of champions league football every year so it was a dream
2803449 i want to play in the champions league next year but i can wait for europe no problem i am 25 so i have time
2803450 i was like a little kid going to be my first day at school nervous and buzzing looking forward to the game
2803451 im not surprised the way we dominated at times because the games we played pre season like against qpr we gave them a doing and won 2 0 the most important thing is the manager isnt scared for the boys to make mistakes
2803452 hed rather we made a mistake being positive and thats a big factor in the way we play
2803453 im a coach and i like to see the game played properly
2803454 unfortunately we had only four players who were up to scratch which was very disappointing considering the number of people here today to watch us and the emotion of what went on beforehand
2803455 we were organised disciplined fit and passed the ball well we have already put this behind us and have spoken about next weeks game against kilmarnock
2803456 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2803457 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2803458 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2803459 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2803460 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2803461 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2803462 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2803463 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2803464 its different this time because it is at home said xian who had a baby daughter last year
2803465 we have gone out drinking many times i have studied him not just in judo
2803466 it was he who gave us the opportunity to compete here he said
2803467 its all the same if its not a gold medal nakamura said
2803468 she had more power and i tried to go against it i should have used it against her
2803469 my trainer and i agreed before the match that no matter what happened in the first four minutes in the end i had to push him down to the mat and give him everything i have ungvari said
2803470 i havent seen anything like this in my whole life
2803471 we had nothing to eat we just had a bit of bread a bit of water
2803472 we have nothing to feed them we give the little bread we have to the elderly they need it most
2803473 it may be an exaggeration to say dublin bridge is falling down but it is certainly in need of attention
2803474 the only way we will know if its in danger of falling down is if you had a diver down there looking at the foundations

2803477 until a society and political system is in place that is best at tackling societys ills instead of the current one which puts greed up on a pedestal and compassion lying face down in the dirt
2803478 like i said plaxico burress has to take care of plaxico burress
2803479 i have to make all the right judgments as far as my health as far as my ankle before i go out there on the football field
2803480 when i go out on that football field i want to be running 100 mph with no restrictions thats what i am trying to accomplish being on the sidelines getting healthy and going out and being explosive and jumping up in the air and catching ball
2803481 i probably could get out there but i want be to my normal self like i know i can and thats what i want to accomplish
2803482 why wouldnt everybody want that from me i think everyone would be a lot happier when i am 100 percent i know my quarterback would be i dont see why there is a problem
2803483 like i said they would like to have me out there but they know nobody wants to get healthy more than me
2803484 i mean i am excited about being 100 percent because i know i have a pretty good idea of some of the things i can do i can take my game to the next level so to speak thats what i want more than anything
2803485 i dont think 100 receptions for a guy like myself is possible
2803486 you know for a guy who has not been to the pro bowl i get double and triple teamed enough i dont set goals i just try to go out and dominate each week i try to beat my guy one on one which i try to do on a consistent basis every time
2803487 i am going to go out and do things that i am capable of doing when i get healthy i think everybody around here will have a lot of appreciation for that when i am on the football field when i am healthy
2803488 flavio asked me what i was doing taking the penalty he was just having a joke i think i doubt ill ever get another chance to score a hat trick i think it went to my head and i was already thinking about my celebration before i took it
2803489 but i think that will be the first and last time they ask me ive been practising all week in training and didnt miss one i must have been saving it for today
2803490 qpr have spent a lot of money and i felt we not only had the lions share we were actually the better side
2803491 im disappointed with the result but in terms of the performance there were good things to come out of it and well take that and move on were a stronger squad than we were last season and we will be a better team
2803492 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life
2803493 i am considering getting a pair of tattoos on my feet one for mom and one for dad i already have 2 tattoos so these arent a first and im sure they wont be a last my question is why are they considered feminine and what is your opinion on this
2803494 iraq and china are concerned with completing the agreement to develop ahdab oil field
2803495 the bowlers still havent really been where we know they can be and it will be a good time tomorrow to hit their straps
2803496 if we can pick up a couple of early ones i dont see why we cant push through
2803497 it was a pretty good wicket to bat on today
2803498 the ovals a quick scoring ground and if we get our heads down and bat well 197 is something we should certainly knock off its been a good week for kev so far and weve got the chance to make it a very good week for him
2803499 i just tried to keep scoring because we had andre nel at the other end who is a real tailender
2803500 pulling the team out of trouble is all i want to do this 97 is as good as 150 for me today im very happy to have given the boys a chance to pull through
2803501 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got these cold chills
2803502 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2803503 it was an honour for us to be in this game
2803504 but it was nice of natalia to come up to me afterwards and give me an embrace
2803505 an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia
2803506 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war
2803507 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia
2803508 is run by lobbyists that represent georgia and other countries
2803509 he takes huge amounts of money from oil companies that are profiting in the former soviet union and many parts of the world
2803510 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2803511 mr scheunemann proudly represented a small democracy that is one of our closest allies in a very dangerous region
2803512 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them
2803513 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors
2803514 unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded
2803515 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2803516 the current escalation of military conflict resulted in part from the lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate un mandate
2803517 oh god if its gonna be like this all the time its gonna be booring
2803518 wir in berlin lehnen als eine der ersten staatsanwaltschaften die ermittlung der person hinter einer ip adresse grunds tzlich ab seit herbst 2007 fragen wir nicht mehr beim provider nach wenn uns die musikindustrie eine anzeige bermittelt sondern stellen das verfahren sofort ein
2803519 der normale tauschb rsennutzer der film und musikdateien sammelt und anbietet tut das ohne gewinnabsichten deshalb hat die musikindustrie in diesem fall keinen anspruch den provider zu fragen wer hinter einer ip nummer steckt
2803520 um herauszufinden welche person tats chlich die tauschb rse genutzt hat m ssten wir eine hausdurchsuchung machen den rechner beschlagnahmen zeugen befragen et cetera in einer wohnung leben ja meist mehrere menschen viele arbeiten mit wlan das auch fremde nutzen k nnen wenn es nicht verschl sselt ist
2803521 unser wlan wurde mi braucht wir k nnen nichts daf r
2803522 wir k nnen nicht mit kanonen auf spatzen schie en und grundrechtseingriffe vornehmen die eigentlich f r andere taten vorgesehen sind wir machen ja auch keine hausdurchsuchung wegen einer beleidigung

2803525 die verfehlung ist einfach zu gering um den ganzen rechtstaat daraufzuwerfen
2803526 mir w re am liebsten wenn der gesetzgeber vorgeben w rde dass wir bei privatklagedelikten wie der tauschb rsennutzung keine ausk nfte von providern einholen d rfen weil sie unverh ltnism ig sind dann h tten wir klarheit

2803562 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth

2803566 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2803567 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2803568 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2803569 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2803570 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2803571 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2803572 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2803573 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large

2803577 the email with the draft release was supposed to go to goldsmith and bersin
2803578 i accidentally sent it to media before it had been approved
2803579 una reuni n de los favoritos porque somos los favoritos los unos de los otros
2803580 esto va a ser otro escal n para seguir creciendo en mi carrera
2803581 queremos proponer una nueva forma de ganar donde todos ganamos
2803582 it looks as if the gadfly has gone public and the story is not over
2803583 the twin message of ratifying the international covenant on civil and political rights and releasing prisoners is right on track and a message china can ill afford to ignore
2803584 despite promises to improve its human rights record the opposite has happened this event occurs as us president george bush prepares to deliver an address tomorrow the same day that he arrives in beijing expressing deep concerns about human rights and religious freedom the world is watching china must understand that if she wants to be an international player she must play by international rules
2803585 the run up to the olympics has been accompanied by a disturbing increase in persecution of unregistered christians including the largest mass sentencing of house church leaders in 25 years a level of expulsion of foreign christians not seen since the 1950s targeted repression of the chinese house church alliance restrictions on religious believers renting properties and attending the games and persecution and church raids in beijing
2803586 pastor eddie romero is a man driven by his passion for those suffering in china he is an affable much loved church leader and family man as well as a respected professor he is willing to risk all in order to provide a voice for those who have no voice in china while csw does not condone civil disobedience we do share his deep concern over the serious violation of religious and other freedoms in china china should indeed ratify the international covenant on civil and political rights and release those held for their religious and political beliefs
2803587 to call attention to the covert state sanctioned persecution of christians specifically and all other persecuted religious faiths inclusively furthermore the goal of this event is to bring about dramatic and verifiable changes in state policy and attitude toward christians and all other people of faith
2803588 all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose
2803589 america will continue to support china on the path toward a free economy
2803590 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
2803591 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential

2803611 we get a tremendous amount of pressure to eat for reasons other than nurturing ourselves and over time people lose sensitivity to hunger fullness appetite signals meant to keep them healthy and well nourished its hard for people to come to a healthy sense of themselves given the cultural climate and nutritious and pleasurable options for healthy food are not as easily accessible as less nutritious

2803637 the armageddon scenario he predicts insofar as it suggests that sea level rises of seven metres might occur in the immediate future is not in line with the scientific consensus
2803638 the two graphs do not establish what mr gore asserts
2803639 however it is generally accepted that the evidence remains insufficient to establish such an attribution
2803640 it is apparently considered to be far more likely to result from other factors such as population increase and over grazing and regional climate variability

2803642 the only scientific study that either side before me can find is one which indicates that four polar bears have recently been found drowned because of a storm
2803643 everyone is very happy to have this safely out of iraq
2803644 we are pleased that we have taken the yellowcake from a volatile region into a stable area to produce clean electricity
2803645 the big problem comes with any inhalation of any of the yellowcake dust
2803646 since 2003 coalition forces have recovered approximately 500 weapons munitions which contain degraded mustard or sarin nerve agent despite many efforts to locate and destroy iraqs pre gulf war chemical munitions filled and unfilled pre gulf war chemical munitions are assessed to still exist
2803647 the purity of the agents inside the munitions depends on many factors including the manufacturing process potential additives and environmental storage conditions while agents degrade over time chemical warfare agents remain hazardous and potentially lethal
2803648 this says weapons have been discovered more weapons exist and they state that iraq was not a wmd free zone that there are continuing threats from the materials that are or may still be in iraq
2803649 there is still a lot about iraq that we dont fully understand
2803650 this does not reflect a capacity that was built up after 1991
2803651 are not the wmds this country and the rest of the world believed iraq had and not the wmds for which this country went to war
2803652 it turned out the whole country was an ammo dump
2803653 we know it was there in place it just wasnt operative when inspectors got there after the war but we know what the inspectors found from talking with the scientists in iraq that it could have been cranked up immediately and thats what saddam had planned to do if the sanctions against iraq had halted and they were certainly headed in that direction
2803654 it is significant perhaps the administration just they think they weathered the debate over wmd being found there immediately and dont want to return to it again because things are otherwise going better for them and then i think theres mindless resistance to releasing any classified documents from iraq
2803655 this is an incredibly in my mind significant finding the idea that as my colleagues have repeatedly said in this debate on the other side of the aisle that there are no weapons of mass destruction is in fact false
2803656 we are working on the declassification of the report we are going to do a thorough search of what additional reports exist in the intelligence community and we are going to put additional pressure on the department of defense and the folks in iraq to more fully pursue a complete investigation of what existed in iraq before the war

2803675 throughout history colonization regularly involved stealing killing abuse deceit and the exploitation or decimation of native people

2803686 in this community of monks there are monks who with the total ending of the first three fetters are stream winners steadfast never again destined for states of woe headed for self awakening such are the monks in this community of monks
2803687 in this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to the development of the four frames of reference
2803688 in this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to the development of good will
2803689 in this community of monks there are monks who remain devoted to mindfulness of in amp out breathing
2803690 mindfulness of in amp out breath when developed amp pursued is of great fruit of great benefit
2803691 now how is mindfulness of in amp out breathing developed amp pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination
2803692 there is the case where a monk having gone to the wilderness to the shade of a tree or to an empty building sits down folding his legs crosswise holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore
2803693 1 breathing in long he discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long he discerns that he is breathing out long
2803694 5 he trains himself to breathe in sensitive to rapture and to breathe out sensitive to rapture
2803695 9 he trains himself to breathe in sensitive to the mind and to breathe out sensitive to the mind
2803696 13 he trains himself to breathe in focusing on inconstancy and to breathe out focusing on inconstancy
2803697 1 now on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he is breathing in long or breathing out long discerns that he is breathing out long or breathing in short discerns that he is breathing in short or breathing out short discerns that he is breathing out short trains himself to breathe in
2803698 2 on whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in
2803699 3 on whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in
2803700 4 on whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in
2803701 this is how mindfulness of in amp out breathing is developed amp pursued so as to bring the four frames of reference to their culmination
2803702 and how are the four frames of reference developed amp pursued so as to bring the seven factors of awakening to their culmination
2803703 1 on whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in amp of itself ardent alert amp mindful putting aside greed amp distress with reference to the world on that occasion his mindfulness is steady amp without lapse
2803704 2 remaining mindful in this way he examines analyzes amp comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment
2803705 3 in one who examines analyzes amp comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment unflagging persistence is aroused
2803706 4 in one whose persistence is aroused a rapture not of the flesh arises
2803707 5 for one who is enraptured the body grows calm and the mind grows calm
2803708 6 for one who is at ease his body calmed the mind becomes concentrated
2803709 this is how the four frames of reference are developed amp pursued so as to bring the seven factors of awakening to their culmination
2803710 and how are the seven factors of awakening developed amp pursued so as to bring clear knowing amp release to their culmination
2803711 this is how the seven factors of awakening when developed amp pursued bring clear knowing amp release to their culmination

2803727 well what you saw in the middle of the football field was an opening to the darkness the darkness is a world parallel to ours filled with dark energy thats all thats in it whenever it breaks into this world it comes out as compressed purple gas sometimes people fall into the darkness and are taken to other times and places that is what happened to whoever attacked james they came from another time in earths history or future so what was it what do the bites make you think
2803728 correct so what in earths timeline has mimicked that popular fictional creature the vampire
2803729 in the 1500s something infected the people in a small village somewhere in france the creatures were just like vampires and they almost wiped out the whole town reason something was there infecting them an alien
2803730 exactly what well according to this the way to kill the vampires was holy water however chances are that the aliens genes just cant handle water they thought it had to be holy cause they never tried regular so lets go

2803734 this is an outstanding little super zoom while this model is very similar to its siblings the addition of the 9 megapixel imager huge 3 0 inch lcd 720p hd movie mode and wi fi capabilities are greatly accepted and appreciated if you are one who is in the market for a compact powerhouse look no further offering good image quality pleasing performance and loads of user friendly exposure modes i have no problem giving the dmc tz50 a high recommendation
2803735 its hard to find fault with the tz50 as a basic compact ultrazoom camera the t50 offers all the performance and flexibility of the excellent tz5 which is certainly why many consumers will find it so appealing sure panasonic could have made the tz50 a much more useful photographic tool by including basic features like p a s m modes but the reality is that most point and shoot users wont miss these features the new wi fi upload feature is sure to be attractive to many consumers looking to quickly share their vacation photos nevertheless its hard to overwhelmingly recommend the tz50 over the tz5
2803736 thanks to the continuous af system the camera is able to start focusing on the subject without you having to press the shutter release button half way down this ensures the best results for every photo moment while the auto focus time is reduced to the minimum once in ia mode these multifunctional functions are automatically activated allowing the user to take pictures without having to adjust the settings to the varying circumstances thus making photographing easy and flawless in every situation

2803754 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
2803755 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2803756 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2803757 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
2803758 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts

2803766 the awg is designing not one bit of software or two or three but a set of rules of engagement which tells software developers how they can write software which will work together
2803767 so if we cant ensure by technical means that a server we want to talk will honor our desires how can we trust it
2803768 now lets look at how we could blend together the technical with the legal the technical is the set of protocols which allow grids to use public keys to establish provably they are who they are the technical is also being able to mark which policies they care to share this can be as simple as using null keys and policies and allowing non secure operation this could be as complex as having a legal contract defining what policies they want to follow
2803769 so if we cant ensure by technical means that a server we want to talk will honor our desires how can we trust it

2803775 doing a deep drm solution would require a closed client a closed operating system secured device drivers and indeed proprietary hardware

2803797 the discussion then turned in a different direction i noted that from my reading of striebers work i suspected that strieber was influenced by the force that the visionary philosopher rudolf steiner called ahriman the evil spirit who pulls humanity down into minerality materiality sterile technology and extinction as i also noted in 2012 i told strieber that i thought he had been manipulated by alien entities that do not have the best interests of the human species at heart communion is ultimately the story of striebers seduction by those entities he calls the visitors often known as the grays he notes that he was going to call the book body terror but changed the name to communion when one of them told him to do this speaking through his wife while she slept he also describes how the visitors were able to make him drink a bitter substance by feeding it to him at different junctures over time as anyone knows who has studied fairytales and fables to drink the potion of the other world is to become entranced and overwhelmed by the beings that inhabit it

2803806 im sure there will be a lot of speculation im sure
2803807 thats one of the first things that popped into my head when lee was hurt well theyll be saying that barry bonds is coming
2803808 i think hed be great if he could perform at a level were accustomed to seeing thats obviously an if given his age 44
2803809 with a talent like that you never know if hell play for the minimum id certainly take a flyer on that
2803810 hed probably love it because wed be getting all kinds of attention hes all about selling tickets and that would certainly sell tickets
2803811 i woke up this morning and it was fine but it said id dh so im going to enjoy it
2803812 im feeling good but i figure if i go out there and run on it and something happens i could be out for weeks but i promise you theres no pain
2803813 under some circumstances he could have gone but it was a good day to get gary out there and get torii off his feet
2803814 he told me my swing looked good but that i was swinging at bad pitches
2803815 he told me that if i swing at better pitches in the strike zone my average and everything will go up and i made it a point to start swinging at strikes and thats what ive been doing the past three or four weeks
2803816 im actually going to have to talk to some guys ill just go out there and pretend like im in the game and play catch with the left fielder or something
2803817 doctors are far from being early adopters so they have just gotten around to publishing a report that

2803819 i was not too comfortable after the first 200 meters after seeing everybody so close together
2803820 it is usually not how it is after the first 200 that is usually the first 300 mark so i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger and at that point coming home on freestyle it is all adrenaline
2803821 it is amazing being here because in the united states you never have crowds like this or anything
2803822 and they go crazy so it is pretty amazing being here my coach is chinese right now all of my coaches that i have had throughout my diving career have all been chinese so this is where they are from this is where they do it so it is fun to be here
2803823 and it was easy only on the last touch of his sword my strategy was to do my fencing and not his fencing

2803857 said mayer eating a steak and baked potato dinner at the picnic tables as dusk fell on this 62 year old dude ranch
2803858 the dude ranching tradition is a little bit endangered especially in places where there is development pressure
2803859 the ranch has diversified over the past 30 to 40 years in order to survive
2803860 were starting to drift toward the resort side even as we try to stay true to the cowboy image and make sure people get the ranch experience
2803861 a lot of ranches are asking what their guests want and then trying to fit that into the cultural thing called guest ranching some are doing it very well others are slower on the uptake and some are way out ahead and too much like a resort
2803862 everythings an experience you go to starbucks and sit there having an experience drinking coffee or to rei and have a rock climbing experience but here you can get on a horse and go to 11 500 feet and have a true experience

2803866 but thats what the guests want so we offer it
2803867 people are looking for amenities that they didnt have before like improved food
2803868 people used to associate steak and beans with the dude ranch but now theyre looking for vegetables and alternatives

2803874 look i had five dunks in one game thats because of the crowd last time i had five dunks in a game i was like 17 so thats all because of the energy in this crowd
2803875 i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
2803876 it was our first game we were very anxious we missed shots that we normally would hit but at the end of the day you win by almost 30 points youve got to take good things out of that
2803877 we played very very hard we give ourselves a chance defensively every night thats what its all about with us
2803878 we came out a little tight we knew that it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams especially china playing in front of their home crowd
2803879 we withstood the storm we calmed down and we just played a lot better basketball

2803889 iraq and china are keen to show their cooperation by finalizing an agreement on developing the ahdab oil field
2803890 the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
2803891 an emphasis on universal as opposed to race specific programs isnt just good policy
2803892 tax laws that restore some balance to the distribution of the nations wealth
2803893 so many of the disparities that exist in the african american community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and jim crow
2803894 the problems of inner city poverty arise from our failure to face up to an often tragic past
2803895 this project is linked to the decision that al sayyid muqtada al sadr issued over a month ago when he divided the al mahdi army into two parts the first includes thousands and millions of al mahdi army elements who have been banned from carrying arms and who have been ordered to engage in religious cultural and social programs and the second includes those who will be chosen by leader muqtada al sadr to form jihad brigades and fight against the occupation forces
2803896 such brigades are yet to be formed and we are waiting for the outcome of the negotiations over an agreement between iraq and the united states
2803897 the al mumahhidun project will deal with the first part of the al mahdi army that is those who will engage in religious seminary related and cultural awareness programs
2803898 the al mahdi army will be transformed into a non political cultural and social organization
2803899 this supervision will allow the sadrist trend to nominate lecturers and figures who will contribute to the implementation of the al mumahhidun project on the religious level as for the cultural level there is a cultural commission that is in charge of determining curricula and nonreligious cultural programs provided for those participating in this project
2803900 al sayyid kazim al hairi the al sadr trend religious authority will supervise the kind of curricula that will be offered
2803901 we have witnessed the emergence of educational programs that suit the occupation stage and the ideas associated with it such as the division of iraq into northern central and southern regions including the kirkuk problem which is affecting us today some giant institutions have started to implement these educational programs in a systematic way
2803902 as for our educational programs they will be directed toward adhering to iraqs unity and the need not to divide it
2803903 moreover pro occupation institutions encourage secularism they work toward portraying religion as being responsible for the murders that have taken place and accuse it of encouraging sectarian fighting whereas the truth is that no sectarian fighting has taken place in iraq instead these are terrorist crimes committed by terrorist groups al qaeda and our sunni brothers confronted these groups when the truth about them was exposed
2803904 we want to direct the al mumahhidun toward the unity of the iraqi people regardless of any sectarian religious or nationalistic considerations
2803905 all iraqis are equal what we care about is the strong unity of all shades groups and formations of the iraqi people
2803906 there are no plans to form a religious islamic state we adhere to a nationalistic state that guarantees the rights of all formations and religious and ethnic shades of the iraqi people
2803907 this has made us adopt a certain position toward the kirkuk problem we want to guarantee the rights of minorities particularly kildans and assyrians away from the interests and struggles of major powers
2803908 these programs will be implemented by cultural institutions belonging to the sadrist trend such as the higher cultural commission and the baqiyyatallah cultural centers
2803909 over 120 centers are spread all over iraq for more than a year now
2803910 these centers will represent the basis from which the al mumahhidun project will be launched
2803911 the al mumahhidun project will revive the literacy campaign that we started in 2006 and as a result of which we managed to help more than 1 000 iraqis become literate
2803912 the program will improve the educational level of those who had to quit their education for political economic or social reasons and will include programs that care for the children of martyrs
2803913 there are private schools belonging to martyr office that are registered at the ministry of education abdallah al radi schools these schools have been open for five years in al najaf and al sadr city more branches will be opened in the other iraqi governorates
2803914 the al mumahhidun project targets males as for females and young women they have their own cultural educational social and religious programs through the women and children commission belonging to martyr office
2803915 the truth is that we have never asked religious authorities for any financial support
2803916 every incident has to be seen within its proper framework you study an incident as an incident
2803917 an incident is an incident and a crime is a crime
2803918 it is as if there is a struggle each against the other and it creates a sectarian atmosphere
2803919 this tense atmosphere makes people ready to explode at any point if they are subjected to any amount of instigation or incitement
2803920 muslims cant say it but its clear they dont accept us here no one can speak the truth on this issue so everybodys feelings are kept inside
2803921 we feel pressure maybe not all the time but we do
2803922 we have liberty of speech and religion but its as if somebody was telling us at the same time dont speak and dont practice your religion
2803923 me i try to keep a certain distance from muslims
2803924 we have simple relations i give you this you give me this thats it they dont want more than that either
2803925 only content to send security forces after clashes catch fire
2803926 the religious discourse has to change from both sides because it incites hatred even if it does so indirectly increasing fanaticism from both sides
2803927 flights have in fact begun today and georgian forces are redeploying
2803928 we are supporting the georgian military units that are in iraq in their redeployment to georgia so that they can support requirements there during the current security situation
2803929 we had already been shuffling forces around in wassit province before the recent events so despite the loss of the georgian units although unexpected we can and are accommodating the changes
2803930 professionally speaking we have learned a lot knowing how to work and move together
2803931 this will serve against the russians even if the fight will be very different and even though i have no illusions of the power of the russian army

2803939 i took this upon myself because my dad ran multiple marathons
2803940 im very excited about it ive never done anything like this before to get out there and practice and prepare myself its exciting im hoping next year to run an actual marathon its my ultimate goal
2803941 i like everything about it even the dust i feel if im not dirty after the game i could have played harder i like the feeling of doing well because i know it helped the team

2803945 you need to get a cell phone so we can keep better track of you
2803946 this wasnt something imposed it seems that this backtracking would be the result of the backlash from anti muslim hate web sites and islamophobes on the internet
2803947 i would have thought that people would have been more sensitive and sympathetic to the concern to the members of our community who want to celebrate their religious faith
2803948 its a little disingenuous to say that they tyson were responding to employee concerns the proposal came from workers themselves

2804283 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2804284 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2804285 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2804286 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2804287 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2804288 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2804289 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here

2804291 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2804292 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2804293 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2804294 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2804295 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2804296 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2804297 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2804298 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2804299 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2804300 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2804301 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
2804302 boycott amp 8221 in your favorite bin laden firm to build saudi arabian prisons to replace guantanamo bay
2804303 in other words if bush personally killed an american soldier he would be guilty of murder under the law he cannot immunize himself from his criminal responsibility by causing a third party to do the killing hes still responsible george bush cannot sit safely in his oval office in washington d c while young american soldiers fighting his war are being blown to pieces by roadside bombs in iraq and wash his hands of all culpability its not quite that easy he could only do this if he did not take this nation into war under false pretenses if he did which the evidence overwhelmingly shows he is criminally responsible for the thousands of american deaths in iraq
2804304 a robber for instance was convicted of first degree murder under the felony murder rule where as he was leaving the store in which he had robbed the owner he told the owner not to say a word or hed be harmed and fired into the ceiling to scare the owner the shot after two or three ricochets pierced the head of the owner killing him in fact the felony murder rule applies even where the defendant is not the killer there have been cases where the proprietor of the store fired at a robber missed him and hit and killed a customer and the robber was convicted of first degree murder of the customer
2804305 to commit any offense against the united states or to defraud the united states or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose
2804306 i would be more than happy if requested to consult with any prosecutor who decides to prosecute bush in preparation of additional cross examination questions for him to face on the witness stand i believe the cross examination would be such that theyd have to carry the arrogant son of privilege off the stand on a stretcher
2804307 george tenet and i yesterday we piled in the new nominees for the chairman of the joint chiefs the vice chairman and their wives and went right up the canyon

2804312 it was just a big disappointment for something like this to happen
2804313 yeah probably could be thats why im going back to tampa
2804314 there have been a lot of big hits hes had hitting in the three hole for us
2804315 one thing about carl he has a propensity to come through in those moments thats what ive seen these last couple of years this guy gets big hits
2804316 we have the mechanics within what we have right now if we choose to do something else we can do that also
2804317 as long as we keep progressing this way i think ill be able to play in a game soon

2804348 its a question of weve been reading about this for three four weeks now
2804349 quite frankly its nice to know that everything else is still kind of doing some business
2804350 were so very satisfied to be at 40 million plus after five days you couldnt ask for more

2804356 police including senior crime officers pathologists and other specialists are now working to establish the circumstances surrounding the deaths and are conducting forensic examinations
2804357 i am very shocked i cannot see if we should live in this area any more
2804358 it is a tough area but convenient for the university sometimes local children attack us i dont know whether it is because we come from another country
2804359 our argument is that the fixed costs people face in terms of rent and utilities makes that quite inequitable
2804360 it needs to move from the current 59 per cent to 66 per cent of the couples rate
2804361 that represents a 30 a week increase it would cost about 1 billion
2804362 this review will address the adequacy of social welfare payments including the age pension so we get it right for older australians who have helped build this nation

2804367 i wanted to get 4 03 but to be honest i didnt feel so great i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got like these cold chills
2804368 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me a thumbs up and holding the american flag
2804369 that was pretty cool i was pretty emotional after that race im emotional excited its a really good way to start
2804370 im in the best shape of my life i hope so i just dropped 2 1 2 seconds in the last year
2804371 he competed the whole way and he did really well

2804373 i was going to sing the national anthem but i was crying and i couldnt
2804374 the last 50 i was hurting but i was also smiling
2804375 this morning some people were going to the grape fields when the bomb exploded on their vehicle five people died and three were wounded
2804376 the reports we received from the police chief of kapisa show that 11 civilians have been killed one of the dead was a woman
2804377 right now we are working to find out what exactly happened
2804378 we can see clearly that these forces are trying to wage a psychological and violent battle against the olympics
2804379 they want to turn the year 2008 into a year of mourning for china
2804380 i do not believe this will have an impact on the olympic games i do not think it is related to the olympics
2804381 the bowlers still havent really been where we know they can be and it will be a good time tomorrow to hit their straps
2804382 if we can pick up a couple of early ones i dont see why we cant push through
2804383 it was a pretty good wicket to bat on today
2804384 the ovals a quick scoring ground and if we get our heads down and bat well 197 is something we should certainly knock off its been a good week for kev so far and weve got the chance to make it a very good week for him
2804385 i just tried to keep scoring because we had andre nel at the other end who is a real tailender
2804386 pulling the team out of trouble is all i want to do this 97 is as good as 150 for me today im very happy to have given the boys a chance to pull through
2804387 it will be one of the toughest races for michael to win the world record will be in danger
2804388 if somebody 10 or 15 years ago would have said the 400 im will be won in 2008 in 4 03 8 id have bet everything i had or would ever get that it wouldnt happen
2804389 that was one of the most amazing swims ive ever seen in my life
2804390 he absolutely blew me away hes going to be on fire now its going to be hard to stop him
2804391 the four of us set out to do something that not a lot of people thought we could do
2804392 going into the last 50 and looking to my right and seeing that i was ahead of ryan and laszlo i sort of started smiling
2804393 i just think he was caught up in the moment
2804394 there are a lot of middle aged men and women who i know that tell me that im an inspiration to them and theyre now doing things they thought they couldnt do
2804395 im hoping that my age paves the way for other athletes who maybe think theyre too old to do something
2804396 in places like where i grew up and where i worked there are incredibly high hiv and std rates
2804397 this card opens up the conversation for people to talk about it
2804398 in this sense it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action
2804399 its an insane bloody war which will surely do nothing to resolve the problem of this separatist ossetian province
2804400 it would be good if moscow would stop adding oil to the fire
2804401 it would be stupid for them to block each other
2804402 after all this is about a strategic question namely securing europes energy supplies
2804403 we cant rely on the americans fixing this yet again

2804407 as a result of many hours of shelling from heavy guns the town is practically destroyed
2804408 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2804409 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2804410 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2804411 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2804412 we wont allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
2804413 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2804414 is not about georgia anymore its about america its values america stands up for those freedom loving nations and supports them thats what america is all about
2804415 now we see georgia has found a use for these weapons and for the special forces that were trained with the help of international instructors
2804416 i think our european and american colleagues should understand what is happening and i hope very much that they will reach the right conclusions
2804417 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2804418 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders
2804419 an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of all forces to the status quo
2804420 russia must affirm that its aim is not to change the democratically elected government of georgia and that it accepts that territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia
2804421 to bring up publicly the idea of president mikheil saakashvili stepping down
2804422 sometimes there are democratic leaders who do things which create great problems for their country
2804423 sometimes those leaders need to contemplate how useful they have become to their people
2804424 this is completely unacceptable especially from the lips of a representative of a country whose actions we are aware of in iraq afghanistan and serbia
2804425 to consider the implications of this aggression against the sovereign and democratic state of georgia
2804426 russias relations with the united states and others would be affected by its continued assault on georgia and its refusal to contribute to a peaceful conclusion of the crisis
2804427 the problem is that they the georgians say various things but what we see on the ground is not what they are doing
2804428 if they want to pull out they are welcome to do that
2804429 russian forces are actually impeding the withdrawal of georgian forces from south ossetia
2804430 the movement by the abkhaz side of substantial numbers of heavy weapons and military personnel towards the kodori valley

2804452 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2804453 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2804454 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2804455 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2804456 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2804457 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family

2804544 no one would have a better idea of oil industry than mr chaturvedi as he has functioned as petroleum and cabinet secretary he has gone into various aspects and government is examining the recommendations till the time the government takes a decision there is no need for drawing conclusions on whether we have accepted the suggestions or not
2804545 we have to take a long term view on reducing indias dependence on costly imports and ensure consumers get supplies at affordable prices the only way we can do that is by promoting a stable and fair investment regime

2804547 should have no fear from the taliban as we preach solidarity amongst muslims
2804548 we are capable of capturing any city of the country at any given time
2804549 we want to strengthen muslims as well as our movement so we need cooperation from all the parties religious or political
2804550 our battle is not with muslims but with anti muslim and tyrannical forces the jihad against these elements is not only in karachi but across the country and it will be carried out until we have a complete hold on the world
2804551 if the world acts properly now and pays attention to the nests of terrorists their training sites the problem of the region would be solved
2804552 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
2804553 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism

2804575 lesnar who made weight at 265 likely tipped the toledos at around 280 by fight time and used that weight and strength advantage effectively

2804577 we wanted to originate a game where people can make sports wagers without losing their shirt if they lose
2804578 we worked hard to devise a game structure that would warmly welcome the novice wagerer but wouldnt slow down the pros
2804579 sportsgrind net offers a revolutionary game that simply challenges players to prove who the better sports wagerers are
2804580 our website doesnt represent or facilitate our product it is the product were fired up because we know how edgy this game is and how much fun people are going to have

2804586 resentment is brewing among bsp workers because of massive corruption and they are now disenchanted
2804587 although inflation is a factor it does not have a big bearing as only 10 per cent of business comes from consumer finance
2804588 we expect this years festive season to be much better than last year since this summer saw a postponement of purchase of air conditioners and refrigerators the demand will culminate in this festive season
2804589 the festival season may be affected because of subdued consumer sentiment arising out of rising inflation and credit squeeze
2804590 despite price corrections the rapidly rising input prices have put margins under pressure though the demand is strong manufacturers will see margins getting affected despite a good festive season
2804591 create forums networks and task groups which involve staff across all sectors people who use services and carers as active participants in the change process
2804592 a very big ask you might think a very large price tag to convene all these groups and ensure fair consultation but help is at hand the government is giving local authorities funding to assist

2804599 i think winston will take the poll just as a motivation to get out there and work harder
2804600 i guess he will be looking at his strategies he probably wont read too much into that poll at this particular point
2804601 on the other hand hes a household name and brand

2804607 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2804608 i dont know what causes one to cross a bright line like this one but its probably going to haunt him for the rest of his life its colossal
2804609 fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make
2804610 i liked him before but i dont see any integrity
2804611 the image of him and his wife was very important the image of that union
2804612 i was starting to swing the bat a little better the team is playing good
2804613 it was just a big disappointment for something like this to happen
2804614 yeah probably could be thats why im going back to tampa

2804616 one thing about carl he has a propensity to come through in those moments thats what ive seen thee last couple of years this guy gets big hits
2804617 we have the mechanics within what we have right now if we choose to do something else we can do that also
2804618 the anc as well as the international community ignores these historical truths especially with regard to the years 1948 through 1966 however the truth and reconciliation commission questioned no one from that era significantly the anc sponsored land restitution legislation back dates all land claims to 1913 this is no coincidence the native land act prohibiting black land ownership was enacted in that year in 1966 south africa experienced unparalleled prosperity with 2 inflation and 6 economic growth
2804619 from each according to ability to each according to need
2804620 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshiping here in beijing china you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2804621 as you know i feel very strongly about religion the chinese can expect that any future american president will also make it an important aspect

2804623 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2804624 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2804625 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2804626 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2804627 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2804628 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2804629 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2804630 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2804631 what lincoln shows is that both sides were willing in a tough financial environment to find a way to make sure that they reach an agreement so there is no work stoppage and programs continue and that teachers got what both sides thought was fair

2804660 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2804661 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2804662 i remember many times ive looked across to sea water lapping up to the front door of the houses
2804663 weve certainly seen some changes around here particularly in the proximity of the sea
2804664 the situation is having an effect on our tourism in wexford but the county council has point blank refused us the resources to protect our shores
2804665 if you get a map from 50 years ago and compare it to today youll see how much land weve lost and were talking hundreds of metres we need a lot more to solve this than what weve got
2804666 this is a threat to tourism here and also a danger to those who come down here to visit
2804667 even the walls built in the 1800s are slowly falling away and the councils response is simple no funding the longer we leave it here in galway the worse it gets and the more expensive also
2804668 we had the vikings the english and now the sea but this time were doing nothing about it
2804669 theres nothing to stop the sea from coming into my back garden which it does
2804670 the council put up wooden stockpoles before and if they had of stuck around long enough to see if they worked or not they would see that there is now a gap of over 20 foot behind them rendering them useless i am not looking for something here for some kind of elite group this beach belongs to everyone and is one of the best known and most popular northside beaches
2804671 theres been expensive work done on the likes of the portmarnock beaches and the reason for that is because of the golf course theyve done amazing things with those beaches involving boulders which make them completely erosion proof they have spent in the region of millions on that but as far as normal residents go there is nothing in the way of action or protection
2804672 fingal county council this year sought for money from the department of agriculture but they didnt get enough to start the work they planned the shifting currents and increasing erosion of these beaches are going to impact on all families along these coasts when their houses are put at a new risk of flooding
2804673 events like those severe floodings in sandymount are likely to become more of a common thing as a direct consequence of erosion
2804674 the major weather events that are usually estimated to happen around once every hundred years in ireland are likely to shift to one in every 10 years now
2804675 aside from the financial impact of losing economically valuable land there are huge risks that we will lose bull island when coastal sedimentation patterns change the future for the island might be very bleak indeed which would leave the whole northern coast exposed to the influence of the sea
2804676 some work was done by the engineers academy on the fact that our sewage treatment plant is very near sea level and we are putting more and more waste treatment at this level opening the risk of salt water infiltration and physical damage
2804677 sewage treatment works in non saline water salt water would disturb the microbiological ecosystem that sewage treatment plants rely on thus rendering it useless
2804678 without a doubt coastal erosion is a big challenge for ireland for the future but we really need to look at the root cause of this problem our emissions rather than consistently putting in stop gap measures we should try to beat it at the root
2804679 to address urgent coastal erosion problems and thereby preserve state owned property tourist amenities natural habitats ecology and private property
2804680 approved projects will be undertaken by the coastal authorities concerned or directly by the department of the marine and natural resources
2804681 one is to build walls to protect the dry land however these often destroy the beach by cutting it off from the sand supply it needs to survive or by cutting it off from the dunes that absorb storm energy
2804682 the second is to put extra sand or gravel on the beach and this is called beach nourishment this tries to replace sand that is lost by erosion and protects the land behind it
2804683 this lets natural processes continue to operate and maintains the coasts natural resilience it is the most sustainable approach to managing coastal erosion

2804712 a game where all the weapons regardless of superficialities like graphical effects behave in exactly the same way is perfectly balanced and perfectly boring a well balanced game offers a set of options that have different positive and negative aspects such that the sum total of all options allows players to define a playing style by the choices they make by having no bias in direction no damage when falling paths that travel horizontally are no different than paths that travel vertically no different in any way there is no tactical choice involved all paths that lead to the enemy like all weapons in my previous example are equal because they are exactly the same a map that has fall damage can offer options and be balanced one approach for instance might require a long drop that would weaken the player but be the shortest and fastest possible a longer route would cause no damage but take longer thats balance not having any fall damage at all isnt balance its just making things the same

2804757 i fear my biggest battle may actually be against apathy and ignorance
2804758 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
2804759 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president

2804770 hes run a negative campaign hes claimed to be something new and different and yet given these you know it is really beyond the pale to sit there and insinuate that senator mccain is somehow going to attack him for being black which is what he did for over a month
2804771 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all

2804951 i left campus knowing little about the millions of young people cheated out of educational opportunities here in this country and i knew nothing about the millions of people living in unspeakable poverty and disease in developing countries
2804952 members of the harvard family here in the yard is one of the great collections of intellectual talent in the world
2804953 there is no question that the faculty the alumni the students and the benefactors of harvard have used their power to improve the lives of people here and around the world but can we do more can harvard dedicate its intellect to improving the lives of people who will never even hear its name
2804954 should our best minds be dedicated to solving our biggest problems
2804955 should harvard encourage its faculty to take on the worlds worst inequities should harvard students learn about the depth of global poverty the prevalence of world hunger the scarcity of clean water the girls kept out of school the children who die from diseases we can cure
2804956 should the worlds most privileged people learn about the lives of the worlds least privileged

2804964 children in the household time spent at work and increasing debt both limit the amount of free time available and influence the leisure activities pursued debt may also lead to longer years in the labor force than has been the trend to date since many will be unprepared to retire with the income and savings necessary to maintain the lifestyle to which they are accustomed

2804990 there is a struggle going on a struggle that demands we choose sides not between black and white not between rich and poor it is a choice between dignity and servitude between fairness and injustice between commitment and indifference a choice between right and wrong

2804995 houdini had a different approach he accepted his circumstances he accepted the box he accepted the water inside the box he accepted the chains and the locks rather than allowing his mind to be consumed with the problem he directed all of his energy toward solving it
2804996 its this stubborn clinging to the connections we know instead of the connections we could make that prevents so many organizations from taking advantage of their latent creative ability
2804997 we learn that there is a right way and a wrong way of doing things we work more and play less
2804998 almost nothing we grown ups do in our leisure time comes close to sparking our imaginations to taking us away to distant planets or to the bottom of the ocean

2805023 i thought it would have been a great nod to our western heritage and we could talk about western values as we move forward
2805024 were really stuck with the idea that we want to look progressive and modern and cosmopolitan but we also want to play up our romantic past
2805025 in 1908 denver was trying to have it both ways
2805026 i think thats part of our civic psychology its deep in our civic dna
2805027 were trying to show off the kind of flavor of what the west has to offer
2805028 the fact is our economy now is extremely diversified resilient and contemporary
2805029 people assume an international cosmopolitan image is at variance with the notion of being a cow town

2805044 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2805045 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2805046 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2805047 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2805048 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2805049 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2805050 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2805051 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2805052 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2805053 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2805054 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2805055 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2805056 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2805057 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2805058 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm

2805060 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2805061 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2805062 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2805063 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2805064 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2805065 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2805066 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2805067 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2805068 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2805069 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2805070 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2805071 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2805072 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2805073 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2805074 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties

2805083 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2805084 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2805085 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2805086 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
2805087 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
2805088 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
2805089 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
2805090 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
2805091 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
2805092 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
2805093 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
2805094 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2805095 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2805096 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2805097 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2805098 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2805099 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2805100 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2805101 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2805102 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2805103 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2805104 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2805105 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2805106 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2805107 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2805108 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2805109 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2805110 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2805111 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2805112 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2805113 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2805114 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2805115 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2805116 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2805117 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2805118 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2805119 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2805120 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2805121 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2805122 just so you all know we did set a record
2805123 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2805124 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2805125 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2805126 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2805127 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2805128 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2805129 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2805130 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2805131 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2805132 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2805133 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2805134 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2805135 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2805136 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2805137 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2805138 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2805139 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2805140 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2805141 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2805142 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2805143 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2805144 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2805145 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2805146 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2805147 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2805148 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2805149 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2805150 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2805151 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2805152 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2805153 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2805154 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2805155 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2805156 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2805157 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2805158 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2805159 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2805160 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2805161 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2805162 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2805163 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2805164 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2805165 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2805166 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2805167 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2805168 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2805169 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2805170 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2805171 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2805172 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2805173 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2805174 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2805175 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2805176 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2805177 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2805178 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2805179 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2805180 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2805181 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2805182 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2805183 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2805184 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2805185 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2805186 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2805187 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2805188 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2805189 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2805190 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2805191 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2805192 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2805193 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
2805194 a number of utilities have reported that only 20 percent to 30 percent of their customers are aware that a green power option is offered
2805195 thats confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
2805196 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program
2805197 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
2805198 as much as 1 billion on renewable generation over the next 10 years
2805199 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that
2805200 but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
2805201 there you go again thats exactly the politics of division that has led us to where we are in washington
2805202 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2805203 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2805204 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2805205 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2805206 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2805207 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2805208 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2805209 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2805210 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2805211 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2805212 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2805213 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2805214 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2805215 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2805216 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2805217 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2805218 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2805219 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2805220 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2805221 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2805222 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2805223 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2805224 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2805225 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2805226 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2805227 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2805228 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2805229 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2805230 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2805231 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2805232 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2805233 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2805234 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2805235 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2805236 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2805237 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2805238 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2805239 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2805240 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2805241 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2805242 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2805243 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2805244 if you dont like your job you dont strike you just go in every day and do it really half assed
2805245 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2805246 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2805247 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2805248 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2805249 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2805250 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2805251 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2805252 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2805253 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2805254 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2805255 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2805256 channel 4 will not be in a hurry to commission him poor old durkin again
2805257 it is entirely appropriate that people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2805258 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2805259 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2805260 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2805261 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2805262 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2805263 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2805264 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2805265 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2805266 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2805267 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2805268 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2805269 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2805270 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2805271 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2805272 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2805273 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2805274 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2805275 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2805276 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2805277 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2805278 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2805279 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2805280 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2805281 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2805282 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2805283 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2805284 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2805285 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2805286 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2805287 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2805288 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2805289 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2805290 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2805291 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2805292 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2805293 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2805294 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2805295 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2805296 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2805297 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2805298 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2805299 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2805300 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2805301 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2805302 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2805303 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2805304 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2805305 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2805306 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2805307 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2805308 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2805309 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2805310 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2805311 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2805312 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2805313 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2805314 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2805315 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2805316 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2805317 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2805318 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2805319 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2805320 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2805321 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2805322 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2805323 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2805324 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2805325 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2805326 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2805327 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2805328 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2805329 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2805330 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2805331 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2805332 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2805333 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2805334 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2805335 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2805336 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2805337 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2805338 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2805339 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2805340 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2805341 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2805342 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2805343 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2805344 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2805345 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2805346 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2805347 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2805348 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2805349 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2805350 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2805351 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2805352 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2805353 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2805354 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2805355 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2805356 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2805357 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2805358 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2805359 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2805360 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2805361 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2805362 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2805363 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2805364 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2805365 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2805366 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2805367 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2805368 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2805369 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2805370 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2805371 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2805372 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2805373 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2805374 if you suggest that selling alcohol is a bad thing people freak out
2805375 safers goal is to have a public which understands marijuana is less dangerous than alcohol
2805376 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2805377 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2805378 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2805379 the question has now changed from when will prices stop rising to when can we expect to see them stabilise
2805380 were as confident as any team youve got to have a little bit of luck on your side but the guys have walked the course a couple of times they have a game plan
2805381 im going to have a go and try and keep up with the minute markers but its a question of feeling the horse
2805382 theres no point going flat out and having no horse at the end theres still big jumps near the finish
2805383 it might be shorter than four star events badminton and burghley but theres the same number of jumps
2805384 the fences arent as big but when you put them close together and add a bit of pace to it it makes life difficult
2805385 every long option you take the seconds tick away and you use more fuel
2805386 i think youre a great fuck and you want me so bad

2805409 were like the israelis and the russians are like the syrians they want to take a mountainous beautiful part of country away from us
2805410 but a few of them are still there in gori which is where a lot of fighting has been going on weve been in touch with them but its hard to say what will be
2805411 and even then they were fighting over south ossetia it comes as no surprise
2805412 the problem now is that a lot of people are being killed and people on both sides are losing family and friends that is how long wars get started and if russia goes all the way in they will cause a lot of damage
2805413 they say that a man who sits on a tank of gasoline shouldnt smoke but thats exactly what the russians are doing theyre sitting on top of georgia and smoking
2805414 but they lost control over these regions when the soviet union collapsed so going back and trying to show strength will only cause them distress in the long term
2805415 theres an oil pipeline that runs through azerbaijan and the russians want control over it
2805416 if the georgians gave them that the russians would stop fighting and abandon the ossetians immediately thats all they really want
2805417 the georgians say the russians started it the russians say the georgians started it but who really knows
2805418 all i know is theyre fighting terribly there and i feel bad for them i love georgians they come in here all the time
2805419 the georgians the caucasians the ossetians it doesnt matter they just want to control everyone

2805461 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2805462 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2805463 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2805464 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2805465 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2805466 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2805467 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2805468 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2805469 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2805470 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2805471 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2805472 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2805635 one sound idea is all it takes for a person to achieve success the principles described in this book contain the best and the most practical ways and means of creating useful ideas there is one point the author would like to point out before delving into the description of these principles it is this when wealth does start to come to you it comes so quickly in such great abundance that you will likely find yourself wondering where it has been hiding during all those lean years this is an astounding statement and even more so when you take into consideration the popular belief that wealth only comes to those who work long and hard think and grow rich youll notice that wealth creation begins with a state of mind with a definite purpose with little or no hard work you and every other person should be most interested in knowing how to nurture that state of mind which will attract wealth the author spent twenty five years researching analyzing more than 25 000 people because he too wanted to know how rich people get that way without that research this book could not have been written

2805680 this continues to be this deadly exorbitantly costly shell game
2805681 we could be not taking into account that it reaches temperatures of 120 degrees 49 celsius or higher
2805682 but we do because we recognize that there are human beings involved in this process and its critical we take care of them

2805722 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2805723 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2805724 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2805725 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2805726 between the composite sketch and the photo identification i had messed it up
2805727 by the time i got to the physical lineup ron cotton had become my attacker and that was that
2805728 the majority race is not as good at identifying minorities as it is its own race this is hard wired in some way that we dont completely understand but the phenomenon should be presented to the jury
2805729 this is not an appropriate area for judges to go into
2805730 yes eyewitness id across races has its issues but is there a rampant problem to the degree that we need to get judges to start telling juries this is the law no
2805731 organising something on the scale of the lambeth conference will inevitably result in a small deficit sometimes
2805732 the archbishops council met last week to propose a solution
2805733 he translated the pain of the palestinians in a magical way
2805734 he made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions

2805742 bob sutor vp of open source and standards at ibm told attendees of the linuxworld conference in san francisco that what the open source community needs to make linux popular as a desktop os used by consumers and businesses are
2805743 stop copying 2001 windows thats not where the usability action is
2805744 digging through gconf editor to find and enable an option
2805745 from the beginning you must audit your open source software and you must track and audit usage
2805746 enterprises having no clear guidelines as to what constitutes violation of open source licenses because most actions are settled out of court
2805747 i dont think ive yet heard of any such case where the court didnt actually interpret the license based on its relatively obvious plain meaning
2805748 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
2805749 every soldier and officer should absolutely disobey any order to kill muslims or aid their killers
2805750 he wants to play for the yankees so he can get at the red sox
2805751 weve also seen several morphs of this spam over the past couple of days
2805752 this is likely in response to all of the media attention and awareness that has been brought up over the past couple of days
2805753 my assumption is that they took the time and effort to do some reconnaissance of sites which are vulnerable to remote file inclusion or other type of remotely exploitable flaw within their web applications that would allow someone to locally host all the malicious files
2805754 i wouldnt be surprised if i find out that someone has basically went through all keylogged cpanel passwords he obtained through his botnet or through the access to a botnet that he temporarily rented
2805755 im glad we got caught so no one else would get hurt
2805756 it was so thrilling that we actually got away with it
2805757 im glad it ended when it did it would have been a mess
2805758 i have a lot of people here telling me how unfair the system is
2805759 at some point in our lives you have to have some sort of accountability i cant see how people in my situation deny that
2805760 to know how truly sorry i am and i am willing to pay
2805761 i need to pay back i cant pay back monetarily this is the way
2805762 it was an experience its real strange to think on that and how i got here
2805763 i just heard shots pop pop pop i thought it was the police but no it was us
2805764 my wife was a wonderful person and didnt deserve this i fell for a coed it was stupid i sit in my cell and think how the heck did i get here
2805765 the military institution says it is ok to kill and use the most horrible weapons and that killing the enemy is heroic
2805766 i respect dick for having humanity over his military obligations
2805767 the regular people and the government wanted to surrender but the military people didnt want to surrender
2805768 i believe it is the stubbornness of the military people that caused the bombing of japan
2805769 when i was a boy me and my friends called it the may never arrive
2805770 they cut a big part of that ridge down but didnt cut it all the way down
2805771 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2805772 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2805773 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2805774 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2805775 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2805776 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2805777 you could argue that no one is ever ready to be president
2805778 competition can create some challenging feelings but the democrats have shown again and again that we get on board and that we work together
2805779 the stakes are very very high i know that both senator clinton and president clinton will have key roles in the convention and i expect that once were there that everybody is going to be together in a great way to do a historic job of turning out democratic voters and also independent and disgruntled republican voters for barack obama in november
2805780 theres a danger of there being too much of the clinton family at the convention its important that we acknowledge bill clinton as a great former president its important that senator clintons public service record and her historic candidacy be acknowledged and so sure look lionizing and appreciating the great leaders of the party is something that we always do at these conventions and this one will be no different but it is all part of a unified effort
2805781 but i can tell you this hillary clinton and president clinton are integral parts of our convention in denver their people are not only welcome to this convention we need their help
2805782 now lets understand weve gone through a bruising primary season between these two excellent candidates and there are some people still healing from that i understand it but in the end i believe that the hillary clinton supporters and hillary herself are definitely committed to obamas candidacy
2805783 im holding a fundraiser two fundraisers actually for her next week to retire her debt we as democrats have to come together so i dont believe a roll call would be helpful
2805784 important for us to be strong against senator mccain who will be a formidable opponent
2805785 i could force you to download child porn or send subversive material to china
2805786 the exploitation is almost limitless google has to fix it
2805787 it turns out a lot of people who develop these things arent good at security
2805788 weve been telling google about these vulnerabilities for years and they have not made corrective actions
2805789 they chose to open the doors and insomuch put a lot of consumers at risk
2805790 i am twenty years old and am in college right now to be a preschool teacher i love kids have always babysat and would love to work with infants

2805822 since the burmese military has ignored the call of the internal national community to begin an inclusive political process and unilaterally imposed a constitution designed to consolidate military rule it is imperative to review the international approach towards burma
2805823 a full blown castigation of the burmese generals could have caused considerable discomfort for bangkok which has just assumed the chair of asean which includes burma
2805824 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a ceasefire and termination of hostilities
2805825 they were on a mass scale and were directed against individuals
2805826 this reminds me all too much of other recent conflicts that have torn our continent apart particularly in the balkans
2805827 all funds raised from this album will go to support initiatives and tibetan cultural preservation projects important to the dali lama
2805828 beyond this in 2010 we will see the world expo in shanghai and the asian games in guangzhou
2805829 china has been gearing up for the games for the past few years finally with a dozen new sports stadiums and a cross city underground railway to ferry visitors to different venues china will be on display to the world

2805848 un provvedimento duro e pesante ma necessario che voleva essere anche un segnale forte in una regione come la calabria
2805849 abbiamo inteso dare questo segnale forte ha aggiunto latella interrompendo i rapporti con un privato una volta che sono venute meno le condizioni previste dalla legislazione capisco la preoccupazione dei sindaci perch il carico enorme il sistema calabria nord comprende gran parte del territorio di cosenza e quello di crotone per va detto anche che come calabresi dobbiamo dare segnali diversi
2805850 forse c stata un po di fretta ha detto ancora il subcommissario ma da parte nostra non c stato alcun intento negativo non abbiamo inteso offendere le autonomie locali ma diversamente non si sarebbe potuto agire
2805851 il provvedimento adottato stato pensato a lungo meditato con esperti ha detto ancora latella e quindi stato adottato cercheremo luned di coinvolgere le istituzioni in un problema che riguarda tutti
2805852 speravo in un ripensamento dopo avere espresso le mie motivazioni al commissario ha detto speranza allagi ma quando stamattina ho visto che i camion arrivavano da fuori territorio li ho rimandati indietro mentre ad altri ho telefonato e ho detto di non venire la nostra non e una protesta e una decisione perche riteniamo questa cosa impossibile perche se vengono a scaricare qui noi ci ritroveremmo in emergenza nel giro di qualche settimana
2805853 chiediamo a commissario prefettura regione e istituzioni di ripensarci perche e una scelta assurda
2805854 si tratta afferma olivo di un gravissimo atto unilaterale irrispettoso delle autonomie locali compiuto da un funzionario dello stato che forse vuole mettersi in sintonia con il clima autoritario che si respira a roma
2805855 il no allordinanza del prefetto sottile scritto in un comunicato secco e perentorio e il comune di catanzaro far valere le sue ragioni davanti al tar
2805856 intendo denunciare sostiene olivo un provvedimento autoritario non concordato con gli enti locali che rischia di riproporre in calabria dove peraltro non esisteva una situazione conflittuale una guerra dei rifiuti dalle proporzioni non preventivabili
2805857 il prefetto sottile sostiene ancora olivo poteva evitare di scatenare questo pandemonio invece di inibire il conferimento dei rifiuti nella discarica di columbra peraltro perfettamente funzionante avrebbe potuto disporre il sequestro dellimpianto per ragioni di pubblica sicurezza e ordinare la prosecuzione sotto certe condizioni dellattivit di smaltimento non ha valutato come era suo dovere limpatto che la sua decisione potr avere sulla discarica di alli che come noto programmata per smaltire tranquillamente i rifiuti di catanzaro e degli altri comuni per almeno tre anni il comune di catanzaro si anzi posto il problema di anticipare i tempi e programmare lampliamento dellimpianto prima che giunga a saturazione

2805864 is now home to anyone who has a gripe with the catholic church
2805865 the roman catholic family can be described today as dysfunctional toxic or abusive
2805866 for decades we have allowed the men who claim to be our shepherds to abuse us
2805867 theyre concerned about the path of the church and where hes leading them
2805868 a lot of the old parishioners dont consider the new ones parishioners at all

2805870 coach z pretty much called out the plays that were going to be the plays that stand out in the game
2805871 thats two weeks in a row when you get that belief and that excitement its good to see
2805872 there were a couple of plays during the week that i said when i get here im calling this play and its going to be successful when i call it and it sort of happened you know it did it happened
2805873 i want to practice winning for me as a head coach
2805874 its not like im gritting my teeth and im punching guys and grabbing guys and shaking guys or anything like that but its just that i like to win
2805875 how hard can football be once you get the terminology down youre still doing the same thing you can only run a gut stretch dive draw theres five runs you can basically run that everybody in the nfl runs your passing routes youve got slant cross out up go so its the same weve just got to get the terminology down and make it work in the system

2805879 we were pretty happy about the right hand side of the course for the second beat but that was a bad call because after rounding we found ourselves on the outside of a large left hand shift the fleet inverted quickly and we went from a position where we were challenging the lead boat for first place to rounding the last weather mark in tenth
2805880 i have won an individual medal if we win a doubles medal that would be a fulfilment of a dream
2805881 all that we have to do is play to our potential
2805882 its the same ball we need to hit we cant worry about the conditions its for everyone
2805883 we are here to win we know what we are capable of and will do our best
2805884 after inspecting the stadium in the capital on sunday the afc decided to shift both matches
2805885 just dont know what happened let me get over it
2805886 did i see moist eyes or was it raindrops the hurt though rang clear in his voice mansher emerged out of the dressing room more composed
2805887 for mansher the conditions werent ideal the rain forced him to change from lenses to spectacles and he was unable to use his filters
2805888 his next targets are the asian games and commonwealth games in 2010
2805889 i know its going to be tough but that doesnt unsettle me
2805890 i dont know about the outcome but one thing is clear i will give my 100 per cent to win
2805891 no matter who i meet from now on i will treat each and every match as a final my rhythm is good and the movement is fine my timing has been perfect all that i need to do now is carry on with the momentum
2805892 you hardly see so many people cheering badminton players the atmosphere is electric
2805893 i was tentative but that happens if you dont play too many matches for a long time
2805894 we are looking to have a good partnership in the morning i hope laxman and rahul play the same sort of innings like calcutta 2001
2805895 he is new in international cricket and the more people play him the more they will get to see him and learn about him
2805896 some appreciation of mendiss craft was due especially given how the batsmen have surrendered meekly in his wake but harbhajan did not see it that way asked about the continued failure in the ongoing series harbhajan came up with the clich and 233 s
2805897 we havent performed up to what we should have these are the guys who have won games for india and done so well
2805898 fortunately this time around harbhajan remembered the opposition giving mendis some credit
2805899 the sri lankans have bowled really well especially mendis he has been really consistent for them
2805900 its a very good wicket to bat on if you have patience you can score a lot of runs
2805901 its not doing very much for the seamers and not spinning big or bouncing much i hope we bat well tomorrow
2805902 sanga feels contest not over just yet kumar sangakkara talked the talk after having walked the walk in the final test
2805903 from our point of view the match is far from over
2805904 turning to the job mendis had done sangakkara was effusive in praise
2805905 i dont need more ram ive got an external hard drive with 500gb of memory
2805906 yes but its a different type of memory the ram is what the pc uses to process stuff and the hard drive is what it uses to store stuff
2805907 why cant it use the memory on the external hard drive to process stuff
2805908 fest steht auch da die weitaus meisten deutschen noch nie einen gammler gesehen haben

2805914 we cant imagine the dressing room without bhutia as the leader
2805915 his presence is enough to lift the spirit of the players
2805916 under houghton the players have started believing in themselves and that has transformed our outlook
2805917 i wont say he houghton has changed me as a player or transformed me completely but with him around i always feel that i can learn a lot about football and that has made me all the more hungry
2805918 i am not setting myself any deadline i am once again enjoying myself and will want to play till i can do that
2805919 i cant say whether i will be in that position
2805920 there are no words to describe the terrible suffering of my people at this moment the chinese government is relentlessly crushing the tibetan people when they desire nothing more than the restoration of their basic rights and freedom tibetans are being killed silenced and marginalized our precious religion strangled as the chinese government attempts to extinguish all trace of tibetan identity i am protesting today to tell the world that while it stares mesmerized at chinas olympic games my people are being crushed under the boot of chinese oppression
2805921 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2805922 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2805923 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2805924 this has nothing to do with the preparations for the games
2805925 there is nothing funny in whats happening it is very sad whats going on in the world
2805926 i am a manager i am responsible for the games
2805927 personally i am rather optimistic that things will be solved
2805928 we are totally confident they are going to make magnificent games
2805929 weve been having a good training camp were excited to come out and play with the confidence weve had so far we have so many veterans when we step on the field we feel confident we should score
2805930 our goal is to make the internet a safer place for everyone
2805931 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2805932 its more of a team unity thing nick and i ran it i told eric day 1 that unless i pass out i am going to try to do everything that everyone else does
2805933 im no different aside from being a little grey headed and a little bit older
2805934 you get used to a new guy and it takes a little bit of time and usually you get the luxury of doing it in the spring where no ones really around or cheering for laps
2805935 i need to call my mom and have her tape espn
2805936 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
2805937 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2805938 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2805939 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
2805940 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts
2805941 the ball comes out hard and fast and straight and long so thats always good
2805942 its been a whirlwind for him and theres a lot of new information going in were progressing quickly
2805943 until i can see the cadence and see the mechanics
2805944 brett had his two hard boiled eggs a little bit of orange juice
2805945 there was a garnish i think and some hashbrowns and i can take you through minute by minute after that
2805946 its way harder to dress down than to dress up

2805972 we underestimated early demand for a system used in ddm applications
2805973 the fdm 900mc program is exceeding stratasys expectations in several ways
2805974 for low volume production its a more cost effective technique than traditional manufacturing
2805975 the fdm 900mc sets a new benchmark for stratasys high end system performance in throughput accuracy repeatability and part quality
2805976 this machines precision lets it rival any competing rapid technology process as well as traditional processes for low volume manufacturing and prototyping
2805977 ive got a confession to make i dont like midcap stocks and i dont feel too bad about it because neither do a lot of other portfolio theorists its nothing personal the problem is that theyre neither fish nor fowl
2805978 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2805979 even a mule wont bump his head again in the same place
2805980 by singing in harmony from the same page of the same investing hymnal the diehards drown out market noise
2805981 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2805982 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2805983 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2805984 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2805985 well the fund is pretty crappy hasnt done very well and is kinda expensive but i get a handsome commission if i can just convince you to buy this thing
2805986 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2805987 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2805988 the front loaded commission is attractive and there is a 12b 1 fee annual trailing commission paid to the broker as well
2805989 never put another penny in these funds but they dont look terrible if you are already in them and have paid the load
2805990 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2805991 look here is a company that can afford an ad therefore the company must be making sales it must be making sales because their products are good otherwise people wouldnt buy them so i will take a look at their website
2805992 he threw me a couple of cutters for balls and i knew he didnt want to go three and oh so i got myself ready for a pitch right down the middle got good wood on it found a hole and got a hit
2805993 i was here all week preparing for the chance the opportunity every day i got better got more pointers so when i went up there i was feeling real confident that if i did get my bat on the ball itd go somewhere
2805994 i can shot put it over to first from there
2805995 i told the manager they didnt come here to watch him so hed better get me in there
2805996 its all about team play and uhhh actually what happened is i tripped it was so much fun im just glad to get the chance to do this
2805997 ive had so many things happen in my life already that i sometimes surprise myself with the things ive done the things ive accomplished

2806013 the worst job a father could ever be expected to perform is to deliver a eulogy for his own and only cherished son
2806014 but a team of wild horses could not possibly stop me from standing here and telling everyone who will listen just what a wonderful wonderful son and human that is daniel james rowlands
2806015 daniel and his friends didnt exactly use their pushbikes for transport to go to the shops
2806016 it was a case of go hard or go home it seemed that bikes were mainly used as launching devices
2806017 id like to think of the countless hours spent together at each end of the same rope with the others life in your hands on the cliff face as a metaphor for our wider life together as father and son
2806018 his passion for climbing was huge and there are more than a few others in the room here now who were introduced to the sport by daniel his enthusiasm was infectious
2806019 there were also several cars including a 4wd a bmw and his much beloved kombi and of course there were the motorbikes his first road bike his new red gt 650 r never have i seen daniel more proud of anything in his entire life
2806020 but above any of his talents or skills or achievements it was daniels nature that made him such a champion young man
2806021 so many of you are here today not because he was good at jumping on his pushbike or a great climber or had acquired this or that so many of you are here today because you were touched by such a wonderfully natured boy and young man
2806022 not exactly a teenage angel but a cheeky cheerful bright fun loving kid he was good natured and above all kind hearted
2806023 they say to be truly happy is to be in tune with ones own nature daniel was a free spirit he walked in no one elses shoes and was truly a happy young boy and man
2806024 he had the best of friends a uni course that he simply loved a job offer perfect health he was still at home and surrounded by a family that adored him the rest of us could only dream of leaving in such a state of joy
2806025 people are understandably concerned that having their id scanned could lead to identity theft or that their details will be used by the pubs or clubs for unrelated purposes such as direct marketing
2806026 i was quite fine with the club having my name address and signature but there are other details on the licence that i dont think they need
2806027 my concern is that a driver licence contains a lot of information and an image and if it fell into the wrong hands someone could create a fraudulent licence
2806028 i also couldnt be sure what would happen to my information and how long it would be kept
2806029 we noticed the impact straight away and they did slow down business a bit
2806030 but we want to make sure the right people get into our club
2806031 it is coming from a long way south basically antarctica and sweeping up from south west to south east australia and it is very cold air even for the middle of winter it is extremely cold
2806032 the air has to be very cold for snow and while most rainfall in our latitude starts falling as snow it melts on the way down so by the time we see it it is rainfall
2806033 hail is formed quite differently and is due to very strong up draughts where the hail gets carried up in the up draught and sits in the very cold air and grows gets too heavy and falls out
2806034 i played the part of a victim who innocently knocked on the door in the morning and was accidentally shot
2806035 i believe anyone can say what they like about defending guns unfortunately you cant account for the mental stability of the people who buy them
2806036 the consultants report and recommendation will be presented to the administrators at a council meeting for determination when the assessment is complete
2806037 this blueprint is the illawarra business chambers answer to the continued neglect we have received from the state government
2806038 this blueprint is about making sure the voice of the illawarra community is heard in macquarie street and canberra
2806039 reliable and efficient transport links allow businesses in the region to get their goods and services to the sydney basin the rest of australia and the world and that means jobs and a prosperous future
2806040 transport infrastructure has been allowed to fall into a slump by successive governments of both major parties we are now being forced to play catch up and the chamber wants to make sure that the illawarra doesnt miss out
2806041 what we need to do is ensure that illawarra businesses can access those markets quickly and efficiently through either freight rail or access to western sydney via picton rd and the m7 and an f6 link into the sydney orbital road network
2806042 suffering and casualties on the civilian population of georgia after the bombing of russian neophron
2806043 we did it it was perfect its a dream come true
2806044 i came over the line and there was so much i was just so happy and there were so many emotions that were coming out all at once i made so much noise because i guess thats just the person i am i want to thank all the people who have been there from the start i have worked so hard i am so happy i dont think it has sunk in yet i still feel like the normal nicole from before the race but its just so exciting
2806045 they do well and you get a 5 million to 10 million war chest
2806046 our relationship deepened when i started my first political campaign for the state senate
2806047 the developers were thinking in market terms and operating under the rules of the marketplace but at the same time we had government supporting and subsidizing those efforts
2806048 i am not thrilled with barack simply because we elected him as an independent and he switched over to daley
2806049 we feel a loss so sorry for all the people
2806050 we have mixed feelings about whats going on about the people who did not make it
2806051 we pray for them and we pray that we all will be safe
2806052 last sunday we met in the hall near the cafeteria
2806053 people were falling out of their chairs and people were on top of them
2806054 i get sick to my stomach by all the carnage accidents will happen thats why you need to design a vehicle that withstands a crash
2806055 its all about cost and were looking for the money to help pay for bus safety
2806056 there is no safer form of intercity transportation than a bus
2806057 youll venture through space exploring new civilizations and life forms
2806058 youll also beam down to planets and have adventures inside your ship its a galactic wide game theres going to be tons of space to investigate we have a great system for exploration which will allow for almost infinite possibilities
2806059 there might be a ship called enterprise flying around but its probably not the same ship anymore
2806060 most of the characters will have either retired or passed on but youll definitely be going to all the places you know and love from star trek expect to see oldies like vulcan and bajor but also fan favorites like andoria and qonos
2806061 youre going to see the actual game working and functioning
2806062 this isnt renders this isnt concept art everything that people will see on sunday is going to be taken right from star trek online as it stands today so hardened people should know that a release date might be closer than they think
2806063 i wanted to go for the record but i wasnt sure if i should but then in the warm up room i kind of got these chills in my body and started getting excited
2806064 this is one of the worst moments of my career
2806065 china has slowed down a lot already but its going to slow down more
2806066 even allowing for some increase in capacity over the next few years

2806069 that money allows me to do the work that needs to be done to advance christianity
2806070 what would they prefer me to do flush it down the toilet

2806074 ms mayawati has no political background she does not know even the abcd of politics while mulayam singh is a political leader
2806075 she is not at all qualified to become the prime minister she can not speak five lines correctly i know how qualified she is
2806076 i have no objection to any political party but the decision regarding alliance with rjd in bihar could be taken only by ljp s national executive
2806077 whenever bjp is in trouble bomb blasts take place in the country when tehelka issue rocked parliament parliament was attacked jaipur blasts take place when karnataka elections were on and recently when bjp s not trust motion was defeated bomb blasts take place in ahmadabad
2806078 why do blasts take place when bjp is in trouble
2806079 its astonishing that in surat bombs were found on trees
2806080 men of rss and vhp were involved in making bombs several times and i have proof of their involvement in such activities
2806081 congress as the major party in the upa has to take a call on the leadership issue it should decide and discuss with the allies but if we want someone who is non controversial then manmohan singh is there

2806097 we wanted our daughter to know her parents were married that was the big thing for us
2806098 our journey to parenthood was not easy cheap or fun
2806099 the result however has been the most amazing experience in the world being called daddy and dad by our loving daughter
2806100 all the realms involved with men are much more complex
2806101 for future generations knowing they can fall in love get married have a child absolutely that will become a way of life more than it is
2806102 as a couple with kids you really see the importance of it trying to get as many protections as you can
2806103 my relatives were screaming with excitement when they found out we were going to be parents
2806104 i think we still have something to prove to show america we can do a great job with these kids
2806105 i had to put on this black suit with all these little ping pong ball like things all over me

2806115 the cultural survival of more than 13 indigenous nations is directly intertwined with the environmental integrity of the holy san francisco peaks
2806116 todays decision not only places these ways of life in peril but sets the stage for an ecological and public health we have no choice but to uphold our commitment to protect the holy san francisco peaks
2806117 in this country native americans have no first amendment rights when it comes to government land use decisions
2806118 the federal government likely holds thousands of acres of land that this case was the last best chance for the tribes to be able to provide some legal protection to those lands nation that prides itself on religious liberty it is unconscionable that native american beliefs are not respected under the law or the constitution we anticipate petitioning the u s supreme court for review of this matter
2806119 this ruling sets a negative precedent that impacts the future of native american religious practice
2806120 this decision is a painful affirmation of the lack of protection for our religious freedom
2806121 federal land management policies are inconsistent when addressing native american religious practice relating to sacred places this case underscores the fact that we need legislative action to guarantee protection for places held holy by native american tribes
2806122 well keep fighting along side our partners save the peaks coalition will continue their commitment to unify
2806123 according to all these existentialists were always encountering these outside pressures from society and the only way to remain authentic is to remain true to our desires despite those pressures

2806143 why does it grieve me so but your heart seems so silent
2806144 complete with tears and everything lol my poor lil guy
2806145 this one feels a lot like what we had pre katrina
2806146 it looks like were continuing to get stronger every day
2806147 i dont know that there would be many more murders here if there were no police at all
2806148 i dont know that there would be many more murders here if there were no police at all
2806149 now even white people have a chance to get killed
2806150 you dont have anything to worry about you all dont look like young african american males who are involved in drug activity
2806151 i didnt think it was right to pay me what they were paying me to make copies
2806152 when the system isnt working you dont participate in it
2806153 there was one case recently where a mother would not cooperate in the investigation of the murder of her own son it scares me
2806154 im looking at this audience and you all dont look like young african american males who are involved in drug activity
2806155 given the number of shootings robberies and murders its hard to say we are in control of new orleans right now
2806156 we need someone to step in and get aggressive with the crime problem were still waiting for that to happen
2806157 a lot of these thugs came back after katrina because they know how easy it is to commit crime in new orleans
2806158 they know that if theyre caught there are rarely repercussions
2806159 the minute people start thinking this situation is normal weve lost control
2806160 but given the number of shootings robberies and murders its hard to say we are in control of new orleans right now
2806161 if you look at the state of the state we are virtually last in everything that is good and first in everything that is bad
2806162 pre katrina the feds targeted a select group of people who controlled a large part of drug trade in new orleans
2806163 they thought that if you picked off the lieutenants and got to the top of the cartels then you would solve the problem but what ended up happening is what happened when pablo escobar was killed they just created a whole new beast micro cartels fighting over the action
2806164 we have small street gangs gangs of convenience the lack of structure makes the gangs difficult to penetrate but it doesnt mean that we cant reach them
2806165 we cannot arrest and prosecute our way out of this problem
2806166 we need social and economic solutions otherwise well be having this exact same conversation five years from now
2806167 books that are not explicitly written about games but which any game designer who reads them just knows that they are really about games
2806168 weve seen some research that says 60 percent of people who bought a wii fit play it once and dont play it again
2806169 so we have to get the balance right because what we are doing is bringing new consumers into the market for the first time in their lives sometimes and we have to treat them with respect
2806170 what nintendo have done with the wii is truly fantastic there is no question about it
2806171 sometimes there is a thin line between gimmick and great gameplay
2806172 at the end of the day that comes back down to creativity they are not good if they are gimmicks there is a challenge for us to make sure that all new user interfaces are deep and are rewarding to the end user

2806174 all the gold that leaves our village is headed to mali to this one man
2806175 he has the means to take it out we dont
2806176 for a long time hes worked with the white people
2806177 we dont live in the bush so we have nothing to do with child labor
2806178 i can assure you that what he declares is only a fraction of what is going out
2806179 if i am wrong you can cut off my head and put it on a platter
2806180 i buy some grams some kilos from here and there
2806181 service or even accept gold from a mine where children work
2806182 it comes from africa and it arrives in the swiss banks thats all you need to know
2806183 there is a desire to deal with this but the question is how
2806184 home depot can track every 2 by 4 to its forest of origin
2806185 you can track every bag of coffee every diamond to a specific diamond field but for gold theres nothing
2806186 if i have one wish its that i might someday have a little bit of money
2806187 sometimes i dream that one day ill own something made of gold
2806188 there is a black pixel on your screen at coords

2806190 we are one with one another because we are called into union with the one christ and stand in his unique place stand in the way the truth and the life our unity is not mutual forbearance but being summoned and drawn into the same place before the fathers throne
2806191 seek for consistent practices around the sacraments so that the baptism or eucharist of each community can be recognised by others as directed in the same way working under the same authority
2806192 to change what has been received in faith from scripture and tradition
2806193 the practice and public language of the church acts always as a reminder that the onus of proof is on those who seek a new understanding
2806194 charitys power as an ensign to the nations is severely undermined and the archbishops later discussion of zimbabwes anglican witness as bound to the communions life was in this respect far more than a passing example permit and even further confusion and the calling of the gospel is ripped from the hands of the little ones for whom the kingdom is given
2806195 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
2806196 those are just the olympic rules in athens it wasnt an issue its new to us this year but youve got to beat everybody at the olympics regardless if youre seeded one two or whatever you are youve got to beat the best teams thats what we plan to do regardless of seed
2806197 it makes you think at times why they put points on it but in the whole scheme of things you have to beat everybody we have to knock down every team that we come up against
2806198 yeah its a shock to your system but those are the rules we can only control what happens out there

2806203 i feel great and my game is right where i want it
2806204 its not such a bad thing to be in the lead especially if youre playing as well as ive been playing this week i still have to shoot a red number its not like i can shoot 72 or 75 and win this thing
2806205 its just like a dream come true and i hope everyone one can share in this dream
2806206 there have been so many people helped me to get here since i started cycling everyone should share in it hope they have the same feelings i do i still dont think its sunk in yet i feel like the normal nicole from before the race its just so exciting
2806207 when i came over the line i was just so happy so many emotions were coming out that i probably wasnt composed enough to take my hands off the bars and do a salute i made so much noise because that is the person i am
2806208 i felt like i was drowning more or less but one of benefits of riding mountain biking and cyclo cross is that you get used to riding in any conditions
2806209 this is a great start to the beijing olympics for team gb and i have no doubt this medal will fire up the rest of the team to do their best in the next two weeks well done to nicole cooke she has set us on our way

2806211 i have a lot of confidence in him he will throw strikes he will do so many different things to get you out or get you innings
2806212 you know hes not afraid to challenge people hes not afraid to throw the ball out there and make something happen i think the way we used carrasco on saturday night we should start him because he is right in the spot to get some rest and get back to start
2806213 hopefully my teammates feel the same way too im all up for it man if thats what they want me to do thats what i signed here to do this offseason
2806214 i embraced the role out of the bullpen as well as starting either way if i can help this team win thats what im gonna do
2806215 when i was with the kansas city royals i did that and it was a huge adjustment back then
2806216 thank god i had that experience then to not just be thrown into it now now i know what i need to do as far as a routine i know what kind of homework i have to do on the other team
2806217 you get to go out there longer and have more time to work i get to throw all my pitches versus just a couple different pitches
2806218 absent any deep analysis it is just horribly horribly worrying that russia has invaded south ossetia we can spend any amount of time on the rights and wrongs of it and whether the saakashvili has brought this on himself saakashvili has not played a smart game thats for sure perhaps thinking the west would stand behind him or just trying to distract attention from his governments unpopularity he has willfully provoked moscow whenever he had the chance but heres the thing wanting to join nato is not a provocation
2806219 all in all were entering a qualitatively new stage of east west relations and both sides know it it is difficult to understate what a massive boon to russian psychological confidence and prestige this operation has been and what a blow its been to the west
2806220 were obviously in a pennant race but he wants me back in september
2806221 he wants me to be part of the reason why were in that pennant race that would be nice
2806222 i wont lie to you it got me back here
2806223 obviously i always want to do well i had seven innings to think about it and i want to help the team win i hate losing i really really hate losing but i wasnt going to let it ruin what id done in the recent past
2806224 we thought we could use some help in the bullpen
2806225 weve had to use our bullpen a lot hes another left hander and that gives us some more options

2806264 after nearly 20 years of working as a television writer i made a radical life decision to teach english at a los angeles public high school i felt it was time for me to make a difference to share my passion for language and literature with the next generation sure i knew that the pay would be abysmal and that the teaching conditions in gang infested impoverished communities might be tough but i really wanted to try so i braced myself to keep going even if there were times of struggle of heartbreak of feeling inadequate and humiliated even if there were times when i wanted to weep from frustration

2806271 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2806272 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

2806278 i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
2806279 it was our first game we were very anxious we missed shots that we normally would hit but at the end of the day you win by almost 30 points youve got to take good things out of that
2806280 we played very very hard we give ourselves a chance defensively every night thats what its all about with us
2806281 we came out a little tight we knew that it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams especially china playing in front of their home crowd
2806282 we withstood the storm we calmed down and we just played a lot better basketball

2806291 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand

2806334 i dont think its my place to tell china what to do but i do think its my place to tell people what is happening i want people to know that nearly 400 000 people have been killed in darfur since 2004
2806335 there is certainly no peace for those people because they know they are being looked for theres no peace for their family its not only a rotten life for them its a rotten life for their families

2806409 its very non obvious to novice users if youre an expert user you might see something
2806410 the other assumptions were that if you were to track the traffic you could tunnel it back there or coordinate with the endpoint somehow to coordinate with the endpoint to soak up all the data they were expecting and transport it around the effects of your hijack

2806427 the phrases anti american and america haters are among the most barren and manipulative in our entire political lexicon but whatever they happen to mean on any given day they easily encompass people who believe that the u s deserved the 9 11 attacks devastating hurricanes and the like yet when are people like falwell robertson hagee inhofe and other white christian radicals ever described as anti american or america hating extremists never because white christian evangelicals who tie themselves to the political right are intrinsically patriotic

2806430 senator barack obama stirred his legions of supporters and raised our hopes promising to change the old order of things he spoke with passion about breaking out of the partisan mold of bickering and catering to special pleaders promised to end president bushs abuses of power and subverting of the constitution and disowned the big money power brokers who have corrupted washington politics now there seems to be a new barack obama on the hustings
2806431 the issue put senator barack obama the presumptive democratic presidential nominee in a particularly precarious spot he had long opposed giving legal immunity to the phone companies that took part in the n s a s wiretapping program even threatening a filibuster during his run for the nomination but on wednesday he ended up voting for what he called an improved but imperfect bill senator hillary rodham clinton democrat of new york who had battled mr obama for the nomination voted against the bill

2806435 her campaign has been based on nothing but race baiting since south carolina
2806436 in the past few weeks ive got past few months and past few weeks ive gotten to know senator clinton very well weve talked weve met in north carolina weve talked about the things that she cares about that every single one of you care about about the men and women in this country who dont have health care about the children who dont have health care about the men and women in america who just want to have a decent job and go to work weve talked about our own children our own families and what ive learned during that time and ive gotten to know her very well is that she believes with every fiber of our being that america can be a better place and that we need change to make america what its capable of being and i want to tell you and i know this is hard to understand sometimes but it is very very hard to get up everyday and do what shes done it is hard to go out there and fight and speak up when the odds turn against you and what she has shown what she has shown is strength and character and what drives her is something that every single one of us can and should appreciate she cares deeply about the working people in this country she cares about the families who are losing everything because somebody got sick she cares about our men and women who are putting their lives on the line in iraq and afghanistan this tenacity has shown her strength and her determination she is a woman who in my judgment is made of steel and shes a leader in this country not because of her husband but because of what she has done because of speaking out because of standing up and we when this nomination battle is over and it will be over soon brothers and sisters we must come together as democrats and in the fall stand up for what matters for the future of america and make america what it needs to be and we are a stronger party because hillary clinton is a democrat we are a stronger country because of her years of public service and were going to have a stronger presidential nominee in the fall because of her work
2806437 im not the one whos an uppity black muslim terrorist
2806438 yes i know that there are lots of policy proposals on the obama campaigns web site but addressing the real concerns of working americans isnt the campaigns central theme tellingly the obama campaign has put far more energy into attacking mrs clintons health care proposals than it has into promoting the idea of universal coverage during the closing days of the pennsylvania primary fight the obama campaign ran a tv ad repeating the dishonest charge that the clinton plan would force people to buy health insurance they cant afford it was as negative as any ad that mrs clinton has run but perhaps more important it was fear mongering aimed at people who dont think they need insurance rather than reassurance for families who are trying to get coverage or are afraid of losing it no wonder then that older democrats continue to favor mrs clinton the question democrats both inside and outside the obama campaign should be asking themselves is this now that the magic has dissipated what is the campaign about more generally what are the democrats for in this election

2806448 let us resolve and work toward achieving very simple propositions there are no acceptable limits and there are no acceptable prejudices in the 21st century in our country you can be so proud that from now on it will be unremarkable for a woman to win primary state victories unremarkable to have a woman in a close race to be our nominee unremarkable to think that a woman can be the president of the united states and that is truly remarkable my friends to those who are disappointed that we couldnt go all of the way especially the young people who put so much into this campaign it would break my heart if in falling short of my goal i in any way discouraged any of you from pursuing yours always aim high work hard and care deeply about what you believe in and when you stumble keep faith and when youre knocked down get right back up and never listen to anyone who says you cant or shouldnt go on as we gather here today in this historic magnificent building the 50th woman to leave this earth is orbiting overhead if we can blast 50 women into space we will someday launch a woman into the white house although we werent able to shatter that highest hardest glass ceiling this time thanks to you its got about 18 million cracks in it and the light is shining through like never before filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time that has always been the history of progress in america think of the suffragists who gathered at seneca falls in 1848 and those who kept fighting until women could cast their votes think of the abolitionists who struggled and died to see the end of slavery think of the civil rights heroes and foot soldiers who marched protested and risked their lives to bring about the end of segregation and jim crow because of them i grew up taking for granted that women could vote and because of them my daughter grew up taking for granted that children of all colors could go to school together because of them barack obama and i could wage a hard fought campaign for the democratic nomination because of them and because of you children today will grow up taking for granted that an african american or a woman can yes become the president of the united states and so when that day arrives and a woman takes the oath of office as our president we will all stand taller proud of the values of our nation proud that every little girl can dream big and that her dreams can come true in america and all of you will know that because of your passion and hard work you helped pave the way for that day so i want to say to my supporters when you hear people saying or think to yourself if only or what if i say please dont go there every moment wasted looking back keeps us from moving forward life is too short time is too precious and the stakes are too high to dwell on what might have been we have to work together for what still can be and that is why i will work my heart out to make sure that senator obama is our next president

2806452 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2806453 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2806454 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2806455 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2806456 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2806457 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2806458 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2806459 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2806691 it is very hard to realize that this is all just a tiny part of an overwhelmingly hostile universe it is even harder to realize that this present universe has evolved from an unspeakably unfamiliar early condition and faces a future extinction of endless cold or intolerable heat the more the universe seems comprehensible the more it also seems pointless
2806692 the total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation during the minute that it takes me to compose this sentence thousands of animals are being eaten alive many others are running for their lives whimpering with fear others are slowly being devoured from within by rasping parasites thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation thirst and disease it must be so in a universe of electrons and selfish genes blind physical forces and genetic replication some people are going to get hurt other people are going to get lucky and you wont find any rhyme or reason in it nor any justice the universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is at bottom no design no purpose no evil and no good nothing but blind pitiless indifference

2806747 he could not care less about our kissing scene when we would ask him about it he was more interested in a new mark which had appeared on his hand and was worrying him
2806748 he even stopped shooting so he could go to the doctor and get it checked out we all had to wait around for him to come back
2806749 on his return i tried to discuss the scene with him again and he started complaining about the doctor who had said there was nothing wrong with him

2806778 i spent many many saturday afternoons watching reruns of star trek and dreaming of its worlds leonard nimoy helped inspire my imagination of what mysteries the universe might in fact hold

2806780 the fact that deputy tollison took his closed fist and struck the suspect in the face 13 times in my opinion was excessive

2806796 unsere juden sind eher als georgier wahrgenommen als als orign re juden
2806797 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2806798 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2806799 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2806800 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2806801 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2806802 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2806803 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2806804 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2806805 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2806806 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2806807 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2806808 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2806809 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2806810 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2806811 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2806812 who are open to doing something on the production side
2806813 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2806814 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2806815 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2806816 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2806817 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2806818 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2806819 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2806820 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2806821 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2806822 its a very significant pull i dont know if well see willie again the rest of this year
2806823 willie plays so hard that if you get him back you know hes going to go hard so you have to make sure the thing is absolutely 100 percent healthy before you bring him back because hell pull it again we want to let him get strong again
2806824 willie is a jack of all trades you can put him anywhere on the field hes a nice weapon to have were going to miss him
2806825 two young guys on the tackle so i mean were going to have to grow with them and theyre going to have to learn game by game and make mistakes that rookies make

2806831 un pas cap a la independ ncia clar i rotund
2806832 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2806833 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2806834 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2806835 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2806836 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2806837 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2806838 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2806839 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2806840 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2806841 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2806842 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2806843 un pas cap a la independ ncia clar i rotund
2806844 hace del blog que dedica a su feliz reto o pero es adem s la vida en mi cuba es la alegr a de los ni os es esa cuba que intentan desvirtuar y que difaman
2806845 pero mami por qu la gente tiene que saber qui n soy por qu me pones en internet es para que sepan que digo malas palabras y mentiras y si voy preso
2806846 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2806847 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2806848 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2806849 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2806850 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2806851 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2806852 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2806853 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2806854 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2806855 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2806856 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2806857 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2806858 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2806859 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2806860 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2806861 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2806862 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2806863 my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair
2806864 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2806865 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2806866 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2806867 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2806868 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2806869 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2806870 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2806871 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2806872 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2806873 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2806874 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2806875 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2806876 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2806877 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2806878 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2806879 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2806880 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2806881 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2806882 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2806883 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2806884 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2806885 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2806886 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2806887 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2806888 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2806889 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2806890 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2806891 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2806892 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2806893 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2806894 estamos trabajando en poner en marcha un sistema que realmente aburra a los filtros

2806896 these guys they just came up to me and offered me a ride so i told them okay when we were in the car one of the cute guys pulled out his dick it was so big i started drooling
2806897 i am not happy because we think the agreement will leave mugabe in control i would prefer morgan to be president and mugabe will go to jail
2806898 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator he was a creative genius i shall never forget how in the height of his career he still had time to work and lend his celebrity to those of us much younger and at that time who were totally unknown even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2806899 i love playing dress up i think its kinky to pretend im someone else and do a little role playing
2806900 look i had five dunks in one game thats because of the crowd last time i had five dunks in a game i was like 17 so thats all because of the energy in this crowd
2806901 i think they knew that history was being made tonight and obviously it was a proud moment for their country as it was for ours you could feel the electricity
2806902 it was our first game we were very anxious we missed shots that we normally would hit but at the end of the day you win by almost 30 points youve got to take good things out of that
2806903 we played very very hard we give ourselves a chance defensively every night thats what its all about with us
2806904 we came out a little tight we knew that it was going to be a very emotional game for both teams especially china playing in front of their home crowd
2806905 we withstood the storm we calmed down and we just played a lot better basketball
2806906 maybe this was our biggest mistake that we think on the floor that this can be continued you know
2806907 there somewhat is relief the day is over we overcame so much it was all kind of a whirlwind
2806908 and we got the nerves out and the mistakes out
2806909 i knew things were happening i couldnt control and that were obviously not very good
2806910 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2806911 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home
2806912 well come back strongly in the team finals and fight for it
2806913 ive been doing it so well in training i think i just pulled so hard and i overrotated
2806914 i am very satisfied with the chinese girls performance if i can give them a score i would say 70 percent mainly for he kexin falling off the uneven bars its a big pity for her
2806915 maybe she was nervous because she wanted to perform her best
2806916 bonds is not a fit for us if he would come i would go i wouldnt want to deal with it
2806917 im going to just try to stay patient to relax
2806918 ill try to stay off my feet for a couple of hours
2806919 eu n o tenho mais idade pra aguentar essas coisas voc ainda me mata
2806920 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
2806921 its more of a team unity thing nick and i ran it i told eric day 1 that unless i pass out i am going to try to do everything that everyone else does
2806922 im no different aside from being a little gray headed and a little bit older
2806923 you get used to a new guy and it takes a little bit of time and usually you get the luxury of doing it in the spring where no ones really around or cheering for laps
2806924 i need to call my mom and have her tape espn
2806925 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
2806926 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
2806927 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
2806928 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
2806929 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts
2806930 the ball comes out hard and fast and straight and long so thats always good
2806931 its been a whirlwind for him and theres a lot of new information going in were progressing quickly
2806932 until i can see the cadence and see the mechanics
2806933 brett had his two hard boiled eggs a little bit of orange juice
2806934 there was a garnish i think and some hashbrowns and i can take you through minute by minute after that
2806935 the eggs were mixed with the hashbrowns so i dont know which one actually hit his mouth first ill film it next time
2806936 si hay tantas muertes violentas es porque estamos de vacaciones
2806937 if we remember our minnesota history this community was known as the settlement of pigs eye and the first rector of the cathedral father lucien galtier rallied to change the name to st paul and he succeeded
2806938 in so doing he really placed our community under the patronage of the great apostle
2806939 this is very much a frontier missionary outpost and so the figure of st paul was a very compelling inspiration to that early christian community in minnesota
2806940 i think in our own day and age the figure of st paul continues to be one that helps us to learn how to engage the cultures around us

2806950 despite their differences social conservatives appear ready to give two thumbs up to former tennessee senator
2806951 its almost as if the man and the moment have met
2806952 doing their job and have in a way tried to put the responsibility onto the government to revive morals in the nation using government for social engineering
2806953 they may support him now but once social conservatives realize his position on pick the issue guns abortion homosexual rights his personal life theyll turn away from rudy giuliani
2806954 i think a lot of evangelicals are just getting to know rudy as they get to know him not as the hero of 9 11 but as a supporter of tax funded abortions his support will decline precipitously
2806955 a significant number of social conservatives have adopted a pragmatic line
2806956 they still care about social issues but many also care about national security economic issues and the environment it very well may be that giuliani appeals to evangelicals on these other issues
2806957 land believes that even if evangelicals overlook giulianis abortion record they will struggle to overcome his broken marriages
2806958 can george washington and thomas jefferson succeed where susan b
2806959 the public will get the chance to decide starting in february when the first of the new coins bearing the image of the first president is introduced
2806960 washington john adams thomas jefferson and james madison are scheduled to grace the coin in 2007 with a different president appearing every three months
2806961 the series will honor four different presidents per year in the order they served in office each president will appear on only one coin except for grover cleveland who will be on two because he was the only president to serve non consecutive terms to be depicted on a coin a president must have been dead for at least two years
2806962 the images will be slightly larger than those on a quarter because space was freed up by moving some of the traditional wording such as
2806963 the notion that rudy giuliani will mirror the democratic nominee on social issues is just not correct were running a candidate who while personally not conservative on many social issues will govern as a functional social conservative on most of the big issues cultural conservatives care about
2806964 the decline in abortions in new york city under giuliani was greater than the national decline
2806965 seventy percent of long term prisoners and 75 percent of adolescents charged with murder grew up without a father
2806966 i believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman that it should remain that way it should remain that way inviolate and everything should be done to make sure that thats the case
2806967 he is americas most successful conservative currently in office he understands that culture more than politics determines a communitys success and he has devised policies to drive cultural change in a conservative direction
2806968 pretending they have the answer as how we got this way when natural selection couldnt possibly have produced such machines
2806969 the kind of conservatives who make conservatism repulsive to temperate people
2806970 t he theory of evolution is literally the only scientific defensible theory of the origin of species
2806971 any political movement that hopes to be successful must come to terms with the second rise of darwinism
2806972 c onservatives need charles darwin because a darwinian science of human nature supports conservatives in their realist view of human imperfectibility and their commitment to ordered liberty
2806973 the intellectual vitality of conservativsm in the twenty first century will depend on the success of conservatives in appealing to advances in the biology of human nature as confirming conservative thought
2806974 do people in the states really think we are getting our a kicked

2807106 lord lord yeshua have mercy on my daughter please stop the demon from tormenting her please lord son of david you are her only hope

2807108 have mercy on me lord son of david my daughter is tormented by a demon i cannot help her only you can
2807109 woman do you know who this is this is yeshua the messiah he came to save the lost sheep of israel not unclean whores like you
2807110 please lord please have mercy on me if you cannot have mercy on me then have mercy on my daughter she is a good girl please help her son of david
2807111 peter this is not right you must not treat her thus what if your daughter were tormented by a demon
2807112 yeshua it is not right to take the childrens food and throw it onto the ground for the dogs
2807113 lord even the dogs get to eat the crumbs that fall from the masters table
2807114 look at you my brother gone from fisher of fish to fisher of people and now a fish yourself
2807115 your faith is great let it be as you wish your daughter is healed right now

2807119 we have built a series of structures and walked away from them historically
2807120 if youve got potholes in the road people go out and fix them thats not the case with levees
2807121 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2807122 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2807123 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2807124 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2807125 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2807126 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2807127 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2807128 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2807129 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2807130 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2807131 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2807132 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2807133 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2807134 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2807135 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2807136 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2807137 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2807138 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2807139 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2807140 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2807141 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2807142 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2807143 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2807144 wisconsin falls from ranks of top 10 highest taxed states for first time since 1980
2807145 the tax burden ranking in arizona has dropped 24 places from 17th highest to 41st and the residents there now pay the tenth lowest tax burden most of the change came in the wake of a property tax limitation in 1980 and their ranking has changed little since

2807156 last night in the mess hall two georgian officers sat down at the table opposite me the one facing me was a bit disheveled his uniform top was misbuttoned it was the kind of mistake you could make if you were in a hurry both ate quickly and silently i wanted to say something but what do you say at a time like this

2807169 i am a huge admirer of vedran he is a top class player with a bright future ahead of him and i am delighted that he continues to be a part of our plans at manchester city
2807170 it is a real boost for everyone at the club vedran is a great lad and i am really looking forward to working with him over the coming seasons
2807171 in yesterdays most recent tank attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to be black possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet
2807172 there were blacks among the dead who were probably either mercenaries or instructors in the georgian armed forces
2807173 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
2807174 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
2807175 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
2807176 its just like a dream come true and i hope everyone else can share in it
2807177 there have been so many people who have helped me over the years its been a very long journey to get here i hope everyone else feels the same excitement as i do
2807178 there was so much in me so many emotions and they all came out at once as i crossed the line i wasnt composed enough to take my hands off the handlebars and give a proper salute but i guess thats just the person i am
2807179 emma and sharon raced hard and kept it together on the flat and nicole finished it off the whole team got it spot on
2807180 our race plan went back more than 12 months and sharon emma and i all worked as a team emmas attacking enabled me to ride defensively
2807181 it allowed me to save myself which put me in a good position and put the other teams on the back foot as a team we rode a fantastic race i couldnt wait to give emma and sharon a big hug because they shared in this gold medal too
2807182 its a team race and if you work together youre much more likely to get a good result than if you dont its really satisfying to help someone win a medal because you know youve helped

2807200 they the teeth are absolutely invaluable it underpins everything that we learn about these animals theyre kind of like gold
2807201 having the teeth is quite unique because they were whole family pods and you dont get access to pods in any other way
2807202 to study these animals in the wild if theyre still alive and swimming around you just cant do it so even if you went to do biopsies for skin samples you just cant do it you never get the whole pod
2807203 you can count those ridges and it basically gives you the age of the animal

2807234 the initial prototype is a primitive implementation with many bugs and subsequent versions will include changes that break functionality and delete all your messages making you start over from scratch
2807235 extensions are a great way to prototype functionality in firefox
2807236 but i want to stress that this is a labs experiment and doesnt mean were adding this in firefox
2807237 the reason why were conducting this experiment with snowl is because we dont know if messaging should be in the browser but we want to find out that and a lot of other things
2807238 we want to gather as much feedback as possible then make the decision to continue if it seems promising and adds significant value to the browser
2807239 those are the questions we need to address but its still a successful experiment even if something doesnt make it into the browser
2807240 we could add some core messaging functionality to firefox or take just a piece of snowl to put in the browser or maybe do it some other way as a more mature extension separate from firefox
2807241 i think this is a project that will run more than just months
2807242 its hard to believe that within three to six months we would add messaging to firefox this is a rough estimate but i think its a one to two year thing
2807243 were driving green into every aspect of our global business
2807244 this includes setting new standards for energy efficiency and green power delivering environmental and cost savings for customers and aligning key growth priorities with our focus on preserving our shared earth
2807245 whether its the music the newspapers or the wi fi if its a part of the experience youll go there
2807246 wi fi is really a customer centric practice for businesses
2807247 all you have to do is look at the growth of wi fi at companies like mcdonalds which keep adding wi fi
2807248 obviously if they felt it was detrimental they would have stopped
2807249 obviously its a part of starbucks strategy because it builds community its clearly a part of borders proposition the longer you sit there the more books youll buy its a part of paneras value proposition because i think theyd like to increase average transaction value and get loyalty at the same time
2807250 ive never understood why mcdonalds would ever want to offer wi fi
2807251 theres an old saying that you paint these fast food places orange because it makes people move and makes them not want to stay
2807252 trying to morph from a drive through to a destination a place where people go to meet and socialize or play or even get some work related e mail done
2807253 people are using restaurants very differently these days as lifestyles have changed weve really had to contemporize and create modern relevant in restaurant experiences
2807254 they are very interested in how to draw in the consumer who may not normally go to a mcdonalds whos now going to go because they can use a high quality internet service for relatively inexpensive price

2807265 the times and most of the mainstream media seemed to be studiously ignoring a story of sex and betrayal involving a former democratic presidential candidate who remains prominent on the political stage
2807266 i hope you will find the time to tell me why this news story is not reported by your paper
2807267 i think every single candidate for president republican and democratic have lives personal lives that indicate something about what kind of human being they are and i think it is a fair evaluation to look at what kind of human beings each of us are

2807291 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2807292 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2807298 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2807299 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2807300 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2807301 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2807302 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2807303 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2807304 to effectuate its new clean up the airwaves policy the commission has radically expanded the definition of indecency beyond its original conception
2807305 magnified the penalties for even minor ephemeral images or objectionable language and targeted respected television programs movies and even non commercial documentaries
2807306 the indecency controls that began as a limited tool for reining in a small number of provocative broadcast personalities and irresponsible licensees have become a rallying cry for a revival of nineteenth century
2807307 we do not expect that pressure to disappear with this courts ruling but a clear decision of unconstitutionality will at least have the salutary effect of removing the agencys discretion to respond to it

2807471 we bring in one person at a time who are seeking detoxification from various substance dependencies we monitor them for a while and as the drugs they are dependent on leave their system and they start to experience withdrawal symptoms we monitor their vital signs facilitate a small ceremony in which they state their intentions for what they want to gain from the experience and then give them a test dose
2807472 we offer a holistic ibogaine based detoxification program to help facilitate recovery from dependence to chemical substances as well as a setting for personal psychotherapeutic explorations ibogaine is a naturally occurring plant alkaloid found in the root bark of a shrub called tabernanthe iboga that grows in the forests of west africa it is a potent psychoactive substance that has the unique property of significantly removing withdrawal symptoms and reducing cravings from substances that cause chemical dependence it has a long history of being used traditionally as a ceremonial medicinal and spiritual tool in west africa for the last 40 years it has increasingly been used in western society as a unique therapy for detoxification from drugs and for other psychotherapeutic purposes our program is based on a harm reduction and health promotion based approach to recovery and personal exploration with a focus on assisting in the reintegration of the powerful experience that ibogaine may catalyze we understand that a multifaceted approach is important to providing a safe and supportive environment and we center our approach on understanding and promoting health on all levels mental emotional physical and spiritual

2807484 lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their computer 2 000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh
2807485 you look for someone who is full of it a real blowhard then you exploit their insecurities to get an insane amount of drama laughs and lulz rules would be simple 1 do whatever it takes to get lulz 2 make sure the lulz is widely distributed this will allow for more lulz to be made 3 the game is never over until all the lulz have been had

2807493 a normal person who does insane things on the internet
2807494 do you know how many ive killed at his command
2807495 hacks like this tell you to watch out by hitting you with a baseball bat
2807496 demonstrating these kinds of exploits is usually the only way to get them fixed
2807497 so the message is buy a helmet and the medium is a bat to the head
2807498 no its like a pitcher telling a batter to put on his helmet by beaning him from the mound if you have this disease and youre on the internet you need to take precautions
2807499 i look in the mirror i see my hair is black
2807500 thats uh interesting i guess you understand that you have green hair about as well as you understand that youre a terrible reporter
2807501 why didnt you get so defensive when i said you had green hair
2807502 you seem to know exactly how much you can get away with and you troll right up to that line
2807503 is there anything that can be done on the internet that shouldnt be done
2807504 i want everyone off the internet bloggers are filth they need to be destroyed blogging gives the illusion of participation to a bunch of retards we need to put these people in the oven
2807505 plankton levels are dropping bees are dying there are tortilla riots in mexico the highest wheat prices in 30 odd years
2807506 the question we have to answer is how do we kill four of the worlds six billion people in the most just way possible
2807507 we need someone to show us the way the messiah
2807508 loki was a hacker the other gods feared him but they needed his tools
2807509 be conservative in what you do be liberal in what you accept from others
2807510 while drews conduct is immoral it is a very big stretch to call it illegal
2807511 people know to be deeply skeptical of what they read on the front of a supermarket tabloid
2807512 it should be even more so with anonymous comments they shouldnt start off with a credibility rating of say 0 it should be more like negative 30
2807513 but i can look at you while youre burning in the fire and not be required to help
2807514 allows me to find people who do stupid things and turn them around zach asked if i thought i could turn my parents around i almost broke down the idea of them learning from their mistakes and becoming people that i could actually be proud of it was overwhelming
2807515 its not that i do this because i hate them i do this because im trying to save them
2807516 ultimately the power lies in the community to dictate its own standards
2807517 what makes a bad person or a good person how do you know if youre a bad person
2807518 a good person is someone who follows the rules a bad person is someone who doesnt

2807528 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2807529 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
2807530 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2807531 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale
2807532 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

2807544 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2807545 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2807546 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2807547 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2807548 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2807549 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2807550 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2807551 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2807552 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2807553 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2807554 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2807555 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2807556 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2807557 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2807558 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2807559 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2807560 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2807561 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2807562 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2807563 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2807564 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2807565 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2807566 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2807567 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2807568 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2807569 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2807570 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

2807573 this wasnt something imposed it seems that this backtracking would be the result of the backlash from anti muslim hate web sites and islamophobes on the internet
2807574 i would have thought that people would have been more sensitive and sympathetic to the concern to the members of our community who want to celebrate their religious faith
2807575 its a little disingenuous to say that they tyson were responding to employee concerns the proposal came from workers themselves

2807579 how did it come about that highly sensitive technical information was given to the chinese why did the president ignore the national security experts who counseled against this deal what damage has been done to our national security
2807580 lone ranger work has taken him dangerously close to the neighborhood of what we used to call treason
2807581 indeed some of israels best friends and most articulate defenders can be found in the blogosphere little green footballs atlas shrugs hugh hewitt and debbie schlussel all provide a refreshing alternative to the moral relativism and politically correct anti israel blather of the media

2807597 weve also seen several morphs of this spam over the past couple of days
2807598 this is likely in response to all of the media attention and awareness that has been brought up over the past couple of days
2807599 my assumption is that they took the time and effort to do some reconnaissance of sites which are vulnerable to remote file inclusion or other type of remotely exploitable flaw within their web applications that would allow someone to locally host all the malicious files
2807600 i wouldnt be surprised if i find out that someone has basically went through all keylogged cpanel passwords he obtained through his botnet or through the access to a botnet that he temporarily rented
2807601 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2807602 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2807603 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2807604 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2807605 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2807606 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2807607 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2807608 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2807609 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2807610 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2807611 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2807612 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2807613 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2807614 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2807615 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2807616 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2807617 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2807618 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2807619 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2807620 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2807621 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2807622 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2807623 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2807624 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2807625 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2807626 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2807627 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2807628 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2807629 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2807630 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2807631 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2807632 as much as bush keeps drumming up and wants to isolate china and divide her people the backlash will be stronger with the arrogance of the mainstream western and u s media of printing everything 95 percent of the people know the truth of how evil the western and u s governments are
2807633 it is contrary to what the olympic ideals stand for the olympic truce is the heart of what our values stand for

2807641 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2807642 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2807643 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2807644 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2807645 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health

2807655 i am flummoxed by the astonishing talent of ashwath he is a boy to be looked out for and is sure a prime substance for star material he is the only actor so far in my career to complete the shot in just one take he does not even by heart his lines he just listens imbibes and goes for his scenes completes it with a flourish
2807656 diga um n mero de 1 a 10 o sete ser o n mero preferido
2807657 the tournament was a very worthwhile exercise for the players they were as good as any of the other teams from a technical perspective but were up against teams physically stronger sides who have the fitness of full time professionals
2807658 we had three players in the panel that were in the republic of ireland under 17 squad for the european championships in may but for the majority this would have been a new experience
2807659 they have learned a lot from playing against teams with continental styles this was a test for them and we were very pleased with their attitude and application both on and off the pitch
2807660 the challenge for these players now is to take the next steps towards a professional career in the game some of them may graduate into the republic of ireland international youths teams over the next few months if they keep on developing
2807661 but you can see it so much better from my place
2807662 why have you spent the last forty minutes blabbing about insignificant things when this is so clearly the thing that is getting you down
2807663 captured by the ottomans and trained to be soldiers in a muslim army at that time the greatest army in the world
2807664 is a brilliant and moving book and paints a grim picture of the psyche of an affected pakistani national caught in the tidal waves of contemporary events that affected the entire muslim world
2807665 is a wonderful and troubling read i was disturbed for quite a while after reading the book and more than anything else i think it sensitises the reader to the anguish and hurt sentiments of an affected muslim of the contemporary times

2807669 so he obviously knows something and would be the most obvious person to question instead they go for the weakest person who is pregnant and question her for hours
2807670 when we come to resolving all our problems and democracy is returned we must take each and every police and military person to task who carried out an order they felt was wrong because they remained silent and carried out the job anyway they let people down and they should not be allowed to hide the i was doing my job or following orders excuse
2807671 their concern should always be the welfare of the people
2807672 is this an example of the good governance and personal security the peoples charter is talking about
2807673 my question is this how they are going to react when a person does not agree with the charter
2807674 we will seal it in blood just like in the movies
2807675 look i got this upholstery sewing needle from my mothers kit there is no way it can hurt as much as a knife
2807676 you poke my finger then i will poke yours and we can rub them together

2807807 in the early years contrastive rhetoric was heavily based on applied linguistic and linguistic text analysis
2807808 the past 30 plus years have seen significan changes as contrastive rhetoric has benefited from insights drawn from four domains text linguistics the analysis of writing as a cultural and educational activity classroom based studies of writing and contrastive genre specific studies
2807809 it is embracing research situated reflexivity and is becoming more sensitive to the social context and the local situatedness and particularity of writing activity
2807810 yet at the very least contrastive rhetoric research could look for patterns across text genres in a given culture
2807811 finally because culture and genres are viewed as dynamic and fluid contrastive rhetoric would be well advised to study text diachronically to identify the evolution of patterns and norms
2807812 rhetoric authority in athenian democracy and the chinese legalism of han fei
2807813 why do the rulers listen to the wild theories of the speech makers and bring destruction to the state and ruin themselves
2807814 as a legalist a leader in the school of classical chinese philosophy concerned with law and method as a means of ruling he provides a good path into imagining alternative placements of act and authority his writing han fei zi influenced the first emperor of emperor of china qin shi huangdi and so indirectly took part in the unification of the chinese empire furthermore his political philosophy coupled with his concept of the power position shi and political rhetoric reveals the lapses of and gaps in democratic rhetoric and its focus on individual and textual authority finally his work is helpful for thinking about speech acts legal or conventional speech acts non actions as acts and hence also a means to an end and rhetorical speech acts
2807815 another type of human pursuit a techne with demonstrable principles
2807816 to escape others power the ruler must be emotionally isolated in the public and private sphere as an ideal an embodiment of the law he has no space where he is a man and not a ruler han feis ruler offers no speech that is dialogic in its trust and so he is cut off from the forces of persuasion
2807817 enlightened ruler reposes in non action above and his ministers tremble with fear
2807818 while china had a notion of the sophistic han feis primary concern is with public benefit and the safety of both audience and rhetor both ruler and minister he does not envision perlocutionary speech acts and dialogue as bringing humans closer to the truth as he is not concerned with truth but rather stability of the state and the avoidance of disruptive violence
2807819 imagined communities reflections of the origin and spread of nationalism
2807820 in comparative rhetorics studies scholars have moved beyond the models of aristotles persuasion and burkes identification in looking for theoretical bases for analysis
2807821 we have positioned academic discourses in the realm of public discourses highlighting abstracted objectified and dispassionate voices as most valuable
2807822 if comparative rhetoric is a method of analyzing different discourses a means of discovering common grounds of engagement and strategy for revealing cultural assumptions then revisionist readings and the recovery of lost perspectives cannot be separated without the loss of inventive power
2807823 as we denationalize and denormatlize our notions of rhetoric we search for understanding the power of communication in an era defined by new communication technologies increased mobility displacements of people and cultural clashes
2807824 in the context of essay writing the turn may loosely be defined as the ocassion to develop an essay or paragraph further by alternative means
2807825 in what i call the contrastive interpretation zhuan ten signifies something closer to the meaning of the term

2807827 in daoism there is one world and it alone constitutes reality
2807828 between rising and falling emerging and collapsing moving and attaining equilibrium that is occasioned by its own internal energy of transformation
2807829 doaists reject linear explanations of events texts are not caused by situations but are part of them there is an interactive flux that dynamically conditions all features in the environmental field situating daoism with a time frame in which certain events took place does not mean that those events caused the sages to say what they did in a linear sense it is more appropriate to say tha daoist thought influenced historically situated events just as those events affected daoist thought
2807830 to treat daoism with an appreciation for its texts and contexts is to recognize its fluid and dynamic presence in the world
2807831 yin is passive energy motionless and still sometimes described as feminine earthy or dark yang is active and overt energy male fiery or light
2807832 laozi recognizes the inadequacies of language and the nonproductivity of argumentation yet uses words to espouse a philosophy in opposition to confucianism in the dao de jing notice that he does not advocate silence nor is he opposed to the use of language his advise to communicators is to speak naturally that is rarely and plainly furthermore words must be chosen very carefully communicators must focus on the dao and cycle their linguistic choices through a lens that sees the particular and its connection to or inclusion in the universal
2807833 in other words language to the extent it functions as a dchotomizing element is an obstacle to truth and knowledge
2807834 led to the formation of a hierarchical society caused greed and fear to flourish and encouraged people to engage in endless disputations over truth and falsehood
2807835 based on kennedys distinctions daoist rhetoric is a philosophical rhetoric the focus of daoist rhetoric is daoism rhetoric is subsumed with the larger philosophy daoist rhetoric engages audiences in philosophical conversations that have tremendous moral implications and provides principles for communication in service of a philosophy rhetoric from this perspective stands in service of daoism and tests of rhetorical propriety ae the extent to which the use of rhetoric promotes or espouses the dao daoist rhetoric is thus similar to platonic or christian rehtoric
2807836 imagined communities reflections of the origin and spread of nationalism
2807837 it is imagined political community and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign it is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow members meet them or even hear of them yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion
2807838 it is imagined as sovereign because the concept was born in an age in which enlightenment and revolution were destroying the legitimacy of the divinely ordained hierarchical dynastic realm
2807839 it is imagined as a community because regardless of the actural inequality and exploitation that my prevail in each the nation is always conceived as a deep horizontal comradship ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible over the past two centuries for so many millions of people not so much to kill as willingly to die for such limited imaginings
2807840 imagined communities reflections of the origin and spread of nationalism
2807841 rhetoric authority in athenian democracy and the chinese legalism of han fei
2807842 nonviolence is the law of the human race and is infintely greater than and superior to brute force in the last resort it does not avail to those who do not possess a living faith in the god of love
2807843 the non violence of my conception is more active and more real fighting against wickedness than retaliation whose very nature is to increase wickedness i contmplate a mental and therefore a moral opposition to immoralities i seek entirely to blunt the edge of the tyrants sword not by putting up against it a sharper edged weapon but by disappointing his expectation that i would be offering physical resistance the resistance of the should that i should offer instead would elude him i would first dazzle him and at last compel recognition from him which recognition would not humiliate him but would uplift him
2807844 a famous unusual and puzzling passage puzzling because of the confucian stress on the dao as an instrument for political action
2807845 if one were to bring broad benefits to the people and be able to aid the multitudes what would you say about him could you call him ren
2807846 why would you call this matter ren surely this would be a sage yao and shun themselves would fall short of this the ren person is one who wishing himself to be settled in position sets up others wishing himself to have access to the powerful achieves access for others to be able to proceed by analogy from what lies nearest by that may be termed the formula for ren
2807847 f or some of us the principle of indeterminism is what makes the conscious freedom of man fathomable
2807848 postcolonial perspectives emerge from the colonial testimony of third world countries and the discourses of minorities within the geopolitical divisions of east and west north and south they intervene in those ideological discourses of modernity that attempt to give a hegemonic normality to the uneven development and the differential often disadvantaged histories of nations races communities peoples they formulate their cirtical revisions around issues of cultural difference social authority and political discrimination in order to reveal the antagonistic and ambivalent moments with the rationalizations of modernity
2807849 it requires a radical revision of the social temporality in which emergent histories may be written the rearticulation of the sign in which cultural indenities may be inscribed
2807850 culture as a strategy of survival is both transnational and translational it is transnational because contemporary postcolonial discourses are rooted in specific histories of cultural displacement whether they are the middle passage of slavery and indenture the voyage out of the civilizing mission the fraught accommodation of third world migration to the west after the second world culture is translation translational because such spartial histories of displacement now accompanied by the territorial ambitions of global media technologies make the question of how culture signifies or what is signified by culture a rather complex issue
2807851 it is from this hybrid location of cultural value the transnational as the translational that the postcolonial intellectual attempts to elaborate a historical and literatry project
2807852 postcolonial critical discourses require forms of dialectical thinking that do not disavow or sublate the otherness alterity that constitutes the symbolic domain of psychic and social identifications the incommensurabiltiy of cultural values and priorities that the postcolonial critic represents cannot be accommodated with theories of cultural relativism or pluralism
2807853 current debates in postmodernism question the cunning of modernity its historical ironies its disjunctive temporalities its paradoxes of progress its representational aporia it would profoundly change the values and judgements of such interrogations if they were open to the argument that metropolitan histories of civitas cannot be conceived without evoking the savage colonial antecedents of the ideals of civility it also suggests by implication that the language of rights and obligations so central to the modern myth of a people must be questioned on the basis of the anomalous and discriminatory legal and cultural status assigned to migrant diasporic and refugee populations inevitably they find themselves on the frontiers between culture and nations often on the other side of the law
2807854 my shift from the cultural as an epistemological object to culture as an enactive enunciatory site opens up possibilities for other times of cultural meaning retroactive prefigurative and other narrative spaces fantasmic metaphorical my purpose in specifying the enunciative present in articullation of culture is to provide a process by which objectified others may be turned into subjects of their history and experience my theoretical argument has a descriptive history in recent work in literary and cultural studies by african american and black british writers
2807855 the act of erasing the politics of binary opposition the inverted polarities of counter politics gates there is an attempt to construct a theory of the social imaginary that requires no subject expressing originary anguish west no signular self image gates no necessary or eternal belongingness hall the contingent and the liminal become the times and the spaces for the historical representation of the subjects of cultural difference in a postcolonial criticism
2807856 the form of agency that ive attempted to describe through the cut and thrust of sign and symbol the signifying conditions of contingency the night time of love returns to interrogate that most audacious dialectic of modernity provided by contemporary theory foucaults man and his double foucaults productive influence on postcolonial scholars from australia to india has not been unqualified particularly in his construction of modernity

2807870 what joy what sweetness awaits a righteous soul in heaven you would decide in this mortal life to bear any sorrows persecutions and slander with gratitude if this very cell of ours was filled with worms and these worms were to eat our flesh for our entire life on earth we should agree to it with total desire in order not to lose by any chance that heavenly joy which god has prepared for those who love him
2807871 it is necessary that the holy spirit enter our heart everything good that we do that we do for christ is given to us by the holy spirit but prayer most of all which is always available to us

2807876 we are christians and we all believe in our lord jesus christ the antichrist ripped off their heads in a flash and christian blood began to flow a child was then led to the altar of the antichrist to worship him but he boldly proclaimed i am a christian and believe in our lord jesus christ but you are a minister a servant of satan death to him exclaimed the antichrist others who accepted the seal of the antichrist fell down and worshipped him suddenly roar of thunder resounded and thousand lightning flashes began to sparkle arrows began to strike the servants of the antichrist then a large flaming arrow flashed by and hit the antichrist himself on the head as he waved his hand his crown fell and was crushed into the ground then millions of birds flew in and perched on the servants of the antichrist i felt the starets take me by the hand we walked further on and i again saw much christian blood it was here that i remembered the words of saint john the theologian in the book of revelation that blood would be up to the horses bridle i thought oh my god save us at that time i saw angels flying and singing holy holy holy lord of sabbaoth the starets looked back and went on to say do not grieve for soon very soon will come the end of the world pray to the lord god be merciful to his servants time was drawing near to close he pointed to the east fell to his knees and began to pray so i prayed with him then the starets began to quickly depart from the earth to the heights of heaven as he did so i remembered that i did not know his name so cried out loudly father what is your name he tenderly replied seraphim of sarov that is what saw and this is what have recorded for orthodox christians a large bell rang above my head and i heard the sound and arose from bed lord bless and help me through the prayers of the great starets you have enlightened me the sinful servant the priest john of kronstadt

2807882 should anyone be lost through the ministers fault and bad example that minister will have to give an account before our lord jesus christ
2807883 my brothers the lord called me into the way of simplicity and humility and this way he has pointed out to me for myself and for those who will believe and follow me the lord told me he would have me poor and foolish in this world god will confound you by your own wisdom and learning and for all your fault finding bring you repentance whether you will or no
2807884 i am sent by the most high god to show you and your people the way of salvation by announcing to you the truths of the gospel
2807885 will accept the word of god i will with joy stay with you if you yet waver between christ and mohammed order a fire kindled and i will go into it with your priests that you may see which is the true faith
2807886 the lord made himself poor for us in this world
2807887 i would make a memorial of that child who was born in bethlehem and in some sort behold with bodily eyes the hardships of his infant state lying on hay in a manger with the ox and the ass standing by
2807888 i cried to the lord with my voice with my voice i made supplication to the lord
2807889 at that time i happened once to be walking along the river bank at first i did not notice an unusual gathering of people then i saw that many people were running toward the docks i also went a priest i knew ran past his looks amazed me usually he was deliberately sedate but this time he was running pushing and holding up the edges of his cassock i could not understand what had happened finally someone said that father john had arrived this was the famous archpriest of kronstadt who was passing through our city on his way to his birthplace until then i had only seen photographs of him now he stood on the ship on the captains bridge a priest with a kind affable face everyones eyes were on him and happiness rapture deep emotion could be seen in them tears were flowing from many eyes what was this they had discovered something familiar and dear which up until then had been hidden in the depths of each ones soul they had not found this within themselves but in another person but that was all the same they felt that man could be beautiful and there is such a man and here he is standing in front of them and all that was beautiful within each one all this rose up in them and they drenched their ideal with tears of rapture and joy the priest began to speak it is claimed that gospel scenes no longer repeat themselves in our church not so for this was undoubtedly a scene out of the gospels he spoke sincerely and simply that he was happy to see us that he wished us all the best and was fortunate seeing that we believed in god and in his christ eyes shone with kind beatific happy tears if the intensity of faith and holy joy were to be weighed on the scale of gods truth i think that this moment would be indicative of the great faith of our city if at that very moment father john had told the people to leave all behind and follow him i am convinced that many would have done so such words were not uttered but it is evident that having touched the edge merely the edge of the holy and the truthful these people began to come to life
2807890 on june 8 from 4 pm people began to flow into the dock area and by 8 pm the entire wharf docks balconies rowboats boats all were flooded by a sea of heads
2807891 when the ship had sailed and all had calmed down i came up to father john and kneeling before him burst into tears from happiness he joyfully embraced my head but i was unable to speak from the fullness of joy and merely said im afraid father that my heart will jump out of my breast from happiness at any moment he smiled and again placed his hand on my head
2807892 we happened to walk into the churchyard well after midnight and came upon a truly marvelous scene and heard something truly comforting the whole yard was literally covered with sleeping people now and again first here then there would be heard a sigh accompanied by the words o lord find me worthy o lord help me and involuntarily you became plainly convinced of what is dear and what makes up the life of our russian nation
2807893 another minute and we saw and heard what until then we had only read about good morning my friends fathers mothers brothers sisters and children
2807894 but then the vanguard a mounted policeman appeared along the road followed by a troika the throng of people became agitated as if a rumble went through it from one end to the other and the word was spread around he is coming he is coming

2808000 more than ever at this conference we have faced reality and we have helped give visibility to vulnerable populations by naming these groups loud and clearly
2808001 we have to keep in mind that we still have five new infections for every two patients reached by arv antiretroviral drugs roll out and we know that even doubling the number of patients reached by these scale up programmes would be insufficient to reach universal access
2808002 behind statistics behind each number behind each graph or curve there are millions of people waiting for support treatment and care
2808003 we need more funds for aids we need more integration with sexual and reproductive health tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infectious services
2808004 we must keep the pressure on the g8 leaders to follow up on their commitment to achieve universal access to prevention care and treatment by 2010

2808017 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
2808018 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
2808019 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
2808020 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
2808021 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
2808022 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
2808023 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
2808024 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
2808025 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
2808026 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
2808027 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
2808028 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
2808029 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
2808030 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
2808031 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
2808032 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
2808033 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
2808034 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
2808035 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
2808036 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
2808037 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
2808038 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
2808039 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
2808040 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
2808041 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
2808042 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
2808043 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
2808044 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
2808045 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
2808046 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
2808047 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
2808048 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
2808049 one day when i grow up i want to be an alcoholic obsessed with pornography overweight and sick or in debt
2808050 in order that satan might not outwit us for we are not unaware of his schemes
2808051 sexual activity with the opposite sex outside of marriage may result in years of heartache unplanned children sexual frustrations damaged relationships going forward and maybe unwanted sexual diseases other side affects may include depression stronger temptations in other areas of life broken marriages and well perhaps slavery in general
2808052 a way that seems right to a man but in the end it leads to death
2808053 i am the way the truth and the life the thief comes to steal kill and destroy but i have come to give you life and to give it in abundance

2808088 we are excited that this piece has become a hot topic for both the media and the public and we find it insane that paris has the country discussing energy policy

2808096 conversion to islam art 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini amp shamala revisited
2808097 currently the divorce is taken to the syariah courts and the non muslim spouse will feel his or her rights have not been protected
2808098 if a non muslim chooses to convert we should accept them but their civil marriage should be settled first give the opportunity to the non converting spouse to claim alimony and custody of children
2808099 this incident reminds us of what happened during the apcet conference on east timor that was held a few years ago when members of umno barisan nasional forced their way in to sabotage the seminar
2808100 obviously some of them were trying to trigger ethnic and religious tension and conflict which could be manipulated to serve the interests of umno and the government it leads
2808101 we are in full support of holding inter religious dialogues that promote understanding rather than unilateral events that could create ethnic and religious dissension
2808102 the police yielding to pressure to disrupt the half day bar council forum on conversion to islam at 10 am in kuala lumpur today is a most adverse reflection on law and order as well as religious harmony in malaysia on the eve of the 51st merdeka anniversary
2808103 malaysia has failed a major test in nation building to demonstrate that we are shaping up to be a more civil society where sensitive issues of inter faith problems can be discussed in a mature and responsible manner to promote national unity and religious harmony in the country
2808104 are there any cabinet ministers who are prepared to raise this episode at wednesdays cabinet meeting to uphold the right to have such forums to be held
2808105 this is unlikely considering the public stand that has been taken by umno leaders including deputy prime minister datuk seri najib razak home minister datuk seri syed hamid albar minister in the prime ministers department datuk seri ahmad zahid hamidi and the education minister datuk seri hishammuddin hussein demanding that the bar council forum should be called off
2808106 if discussing our constitution and our laws is equivalent to
2808107 well it appears that this type of thuggish and loutish behaviour is unfortunately not only limited to umno youth
2808108 on aug 27 i will enter parliament then the prime minister will table the budget 2009 and after we will rock the parliament by taking over the government
2808109 at the moment i dont see any candidates certainly from the bn anwar is going to win what will be interesting is the margin whether it is bigger or less than what he obtained previously

2808111 we are going to discuss the matter zulkifli claims that he is there as a member of pembela but he is still a party member
2808112 in principle we support peaceful demonstrations but are against the use of insulting and racial language and the storming of places where people are having discussions
2808113 i know that he is aware that the party is disagreeable to his actions
2808114 i echo syed husins statement as zulkifli acted without the sanction of the party and does not reflect our stand on the matter
2808115 i must report to you that many non muslims feel marginalised in todays malaysia

2808123 impact of laws and government policies on indigenous people in sabah
2808124 sapp as one of the barisan component parties in sabah has delivered its views about sabah issues and we also have similar views on the problems faced by the people in the state
2808125 i still had some cases here and there and that kept me through
2808126 im not a member of the pkr parti keadilan rakyat or any other opposition party
2808127 yes in a way it is anwar and i were just saying it yesterday in court
2808128 i have faith in the court system there are good judges there
2808129 it was a silly thing to do after that i wrote to them
2808130 i said dont arrest him that way if you want him in court i will take him to you
2808131 second time round it worked out well i even got an sms from one of the officers thanking me for co operating with them
2808132 in 1998 people were afraid to speak out they were worried the police would arrest them
2808133 now you have the internet views are a lot freer i get people coming up to me telling me they are not scared like before they are willing to speak out
2808134 this case is full of holes for example the police report wasnt even given to me i asked for it in court and they said no so after court yesterday i went back and wrote them a letter and still they said no

2808159 uno de sus envidiosos contempor neos le apod beta la segunda letra del alfabeto griego porque seg n dec a erat stenes era en todo el segundo mejor del mundo pero parece claro que erat stenes era alfa en casi todo fue astr nomo historiador ge grafo fil sofo poeta cr tico teatral y matem tico los t tulos de las obras que escribi van desde astronom a hasta sobre la libertad ante el dolor fue tambi n director de la gran biblioteca de alejandr a donde un d a ley en un libro de papiro que en un puesto avanzado de la frontera meridional en siena cerca de la primera catarata del nilo en el mediod a del 21 de junio un palo vertical no proyectaba sombra en el solsticio de verano el d a m s largo del a o a medida que avanzaban las horas y se acercaba el mediod a las sombras de las columnas del templo iban acort ndose en el mediod a hab an desaparecido en aquel momento pod a verse el sol reflejado en el agua en el fondo de un pozo hondo el sol estaba directamente encima de las cabezas era una observaci n que otros podr an haber ignorado con facilidad palos sombras reflejos en pozos la posici n del sol qu importancia pod an tener cosas tan sencillas y cotidianas pero erat stenes era un cient fico y sus conjeturas sobre estos t picos cambiaron el mundo en cierto sentido hicieron el mundo erat stenes tuvo la presencia de nimo de hacer un experimento de observar realmente si en alejandr a los palos verticales proyectaban sombras hacia el mediod a del 21 de junio y descubri que s lo hac an erat stenes se pregunt entonces a qu se deb a que en el mismo instante un bast n no proyectara en siena ninguna sombra mientras que en alejandr a a gran distancia hacia el norte proyectaba una sombra pronunciada veamos un mapa del antiguo egipto con dos palos verticales de igual longitud uno clavado en alejandr a y el otro en siena supongamos que en un momento dado cada palo no proyectara sombra alguna el hecho se explica de modo muy f cil basta suponer que la tierra es plana el sol se encontrar entonces encima mismo de nuestras cabezas si los dos palos proyectan sombras de longitud igual la cosa tambi n se explica en una tierra plana los rayos del sol tienen la misma inclinaci n y forman el mismo ngulo con los dos palos pero c mo explicarse que en siena no hab a sombra y al mismo tiempo en alejandr a la sombra era considerable erat stenes comprendi que la nica respuesta posible es que la superficie de la tierra est curvada y no s lo esto cuanto mayor sea la curvatura mayor ser la diferencia entre las longitudes de las sombras el sol est tan lejos que sus rayos son paralelos cuando llegan a la tierra los palos situados formando ngulos diferentes con respecto a los rayos del sol proyectan sombras de longitudes diferentes la diferencia observada en las longitudes de las sombras hac a necesario que la distancia entre alejandr a y siena fuera de unos siete grados a lo largo de la superficie de la tierra es decir que si imaginamos los palos prolongados hasta llegar al centro de la tierra formar n all un ngulo de siete grados siete grados es aproximadamente una cincuentava parte de los trescientos sesenta grados que contiene la circunferencia entera de la tierra erat stenes sab a que la distancia entre alejandr a y siena era de unos 800 kil metros porque contrat a un hombre para que lo midiera a pasos ochocientos kil metros por 50 dan 40 000 kil metros sta deb a ser pues la circunferencia de la tierra sta es la respuesta correcta las nicas herramientas de erat stenes fueron palos ojos pies y cerebros y adem s el gusto por la experimentaci n con estos elementos dedujo la circunferencia de la tierra con un error de s lo unas partes por ciento lo que constituye un logro notable hace 2 200 a os fue la primera persona que midi con precisi n el tama o de un planeta el mundo mediterr neo de aquella poca ten a fama por sus navegaciones alejandr a era el mayor puerto de mar del planeta sabiendo ya que la tierra era una esfera de dimensiones modestas no iba a sentir nadie la tentaci n de emprender viajes de exploraci n de buscar tierras todav a sin descubrir quiz s incluso de intentar una vuelta en barco a todo el planeta cuatrocientos a os antes de erat stenes una flota fenicia contratada por el fara n egipcio necao hab a circunnavegado frica se hicieron a la mar en la orilla del mar rojo probablemente en botes fr giles y abiertos bajaron por la costa oriental de frica subieron luego por el atl ntico y regresaron finalmente a trav s del mediterr neo esta expedici n pica les ocup tres a os casi el mismo tiempo que tarda una moderna nave espacial voyager en volar de la tierra a satumo despu s del descubrimiento de erat stenes marineros audaces y aventurados intentaron muchos grandes viajes sus naves eran diminutas dispon an nicamente de instrumentos rudimentarios de navegaci n navegaban por estima y segu an siempre que pod an la l nea costera en un oc ano desconocido pod an determinar su latitud pero no su longitud observando noche tras noche la posici n de las constelaciones con relaci n al horizonte las constelaciones familiares eran sin duda un elemento tranquilizador en medio de un oc ano inexplorado las estrellas son las amigas de los exploradores antes cuando las naves navegaban sobre la tierra y ahora que las naves espaciales navegan por el cielo despu s de erat stenes es posible que hubiera algunos intentos pero hasta la poca de magallanes nadie consigui circunnavegar la tierra qu historias de audacia y de aventura debieron llegar a contarse mientras los marineros y los navegantes hombres pr cticos del mundo pon an en juego sus vidas dando fe a las matem ticas de un cient fico de alejandr a en la poca de erat stenes se construyeron globos que representaban a la tierra vista desde el espacio eran esencialmente correctos en su descripci n del mediterr neo una regi n bien explorada pero se hac an cada vez m s inexactos a medida que se alejaban de casa nuestro actual conocimiento del cosmos repite este rasgo desagradable pero inevitable en el siglo primero el ge grafo alejandrino estrab n escribi quienes han regresado de un intento de circunnavegar la tierra no dicen que se lo haya impedido la presencia de un continente en su camino porque el mar se manten a perfectamente abierto sino m s bien la falta de decisi n y la escasez de provisiones erat stenes dice que a no ser por el obst culo que representa la extensi n del oc ano atl ntico podr a llegar f cilmente por mar de iberia a la india es muy posible que en la zona templada haya una o dos tierras habitables de hecho si esta otra parte del mundo est habitada no lo est por personas como las que existen en nuestras partes y deber amos considerarlo como otro mundo habitado el hombre empezaba a aventurarse en el sentido casi exacto de la palabra por otros mundos la exploraci n subsiguiente de la tierra fue una empresa mundial incluyendo viajes de ida y vuelta a china y polinesia la culminaci n fue sin duda el descubrimiento de am rica por crist bal col n y los viajes de los siglos siguientes que completaron la exploraci n geogr fica de la tierra el primer viaje de col n est relacionado del modo m s directo con los c lculos de erat stenes col n estaba fascinado por lo que llamaba la empresa de la indias un proyecto para llegar al jap n china y la india no siguiendo la costa de frica y navegando hacia el oriente sino lanz ndose audazmente dentro del desconocido oc ano occidental o bien como erat stenes hab a dicho con asombrosa pre ciencia pasando por mar de iberia a la india col n hab a sido un vendedor ambulante de mapas viejos y un lector asiduo de libros escritos por antiguos ge grafos como erat stenes estrab n y tolomeo o de libros que trataran de ellos pero para que la empresa de las indias fuera posible para que las naves y sus tripulaciones sobrevivieran al largo viaje la tierra ten a que ser m s peque a de lo que erat stenes hab a dicho por lo tanto col n hizo trampa con sus c lculos como indic muy correctamente la facultad de la universidad de salamanca que los examin utiliz la menor circunferencia posible de la tierra y la mayor extensi n hacia el este de asia que pudo encontrar en todos los libros de que dispon a y luego exager incluso estas cifras de no haber estado las am ricas en medio del camino las expediciones de col n habr an fracasado rotundamente

2808176 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2808177 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2808178 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2808179 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2808180 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2808181 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2808182 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2808183 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2808200 there are four characteristics which brand a country unmistakably as a dictatorship one party rule executions without trial or with a mock trial for political offenses the nationalization or expropriation of private property and censorship a country guilty of these outrages forfeits any moral prerogatives any claim to national rights or sovereignty and becomes an outlaw

2808208 well ill give you the benefit of the doubt take the next exit
2808209 im going to need to think on that for a little while before i get back to you i may need to come together with my wife and see if we can come up with something together
2808210 i heard she wants a rematch so i thought id come back and give her one
2808211 she had 119 matches without a loss i couldnt let her continue with that i know that i can beat the best in the world and now i have the evidence to prove it

2808223 isaac was unique and an inspiration to us all his accomplishments as a musician are unparalleled but more than that he was a very dear friend and great supporter of the soulsville foundation mission particularly the work we do with children we will miss him and his wonderful presence more than we can convey at this time
2808224 after a thorough review of all the evidence testimony and facts of this case this court concludes the strongly expressed convictions of the trial court in this case may not be easily and objectively reconsidered
2808225 it was clear that he had a point a view and we disagreed with it we tried the case and he cut us off at every pass
2808226 ive never had something like this in my whole career and i hope i never do again
2808227 in sum the trial court erred in ignoring the materiality prong and in misapplying the intent prong of the inequitable conduct test
2808228 a new day has dawned everything that judge real did has been erased

2808359 i was afraid to do anything i decided to get a good look to make sure it was her so i could report it

2808379 but they arent taking into account what that revenue could later buy for the states
2808380 weve given them the benefit of the doubt for a long time

2808411 but based on this data do we have issues yes
2808412 is hurtful to the larger community because people are not going to call the police when something goes wrong
2808413 because there was a small light near my license plate that was out then they get deep into interrogation theyre trying to figure out if youre here legally
2808414 we need to find out why theyre doing it and if we find out its more the new officers than those with five to 20 years experience that tells me theres a lack of training when it comes to policing black people and latinos
2808415 most of the stuff we do is very legitimate and some of the stuff we do innocent people get caught up in
2808416 i have vice presidents and executive board members of the naacp that have been stopped on their way home
2808417 refreshing that theyre releasing statistics that show what blacks and latinos have been saying for a long time its a first step in doing something about it

2808437 barack obamas faith and his spiritual journey not only are shaping this election but also as you tell the story and reflect on it captures many of the trends that are most powerful and transforming in this age
2808438 the younger voters coming on line tend to be postmodern theologically to the extent they are theological at all and tend to lean leftward in their politics
2808439 i think obama is very clear that he first went to church to get connected to a church not so much out of a spiritual search but because people he was working with in the south side of chicago challenged him that he would be more successful if he had some connections to church some connection to faith but i think in time he was captured by the gospel
2808440 obama is a unique creature because he is so deeply christian who intends to bring his faith to bear on public policy and is very much on the left
2808441 i think what is diminishing is a secular approach to politics and whats arising is a faith based approach to politics and now i think we have the opportunity in this country for the great debate between a right leaning limited government low taxes anti abortion type of faith based politics and then the more left leaning version of that on the other side
2808442 as a christian i have written a book about another mans faith and im intrigued by his faith
2808443 i want to encourage his faith and i believe he is sincere about his faith now people who share my political vies are upset with me because i have written this book and basically what they are saying is you are too christian you should be more republican than you are christian what i have written is an honest objective evaluation that celebrates obamas faith to the extent it can be celebrated questioned it where it had to be questioned and basically tries to explain it in terms of our times which is something we need by the way as we approach this election
2808444 i have to say that one of my goals for this book besides just the content was to find the tone that i hope will be replicated a bit more in american politics
2808445 this vicious left right fighting that is happening in america is paralyzing us it is keeping up from accomplishing anything and i have to say as a christian it is ungodly my hope was to write a book that would model a certain tone while communicating facts that people need to know
2808446 i did feel for a long period that there wasnt anything new to buy
2808447 but i really like the slim fit its not so roomy not so bulky and its a lot cleaner

2808461 about 240 000 of the lost bags never reached their owners
2808462 ends up in the small alabama town of scottsboro at the unclaimed baggage center
2808463 us airlines last year lost about 10 000 bags a day on average the worst performance since 1990
2808464 us airways remains the worst major airline for bag handling performance consistently trailing the industry average government figures show the carrier experienced 9 62 complaints per 1 000 passengers for 2005 government data report the ratio improved to 7 66 in 2006 but fell back to 8 37 through 11 months of 2007
2808465 too few workers was the reason for massive problems with us airways passengers bags over the 2004 christmas holiday season according to a report by the transportation departments inspector general that december 42 of consumer complaints about baggage had to do with us airways said samuel podberesky an assistant general counsel at the department those problems continued into 2005 and may account for much of the increase in the number of mishandled bags that year podberesky said

2808469 i just spoke separately with secretary rice and president saakashvili about the grave crisis in georgia i told president saakashvili that i was deeply concerned about the well being of the people of georgia
2808470 over the last two days russia has escalated the crisis in georgia through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2808471 as i have said for many months aggressive diplomatic action must be taken to reach a political resolution to this crisis and to assure that georgias sovereignty is protected
2808472 the situation in georgia also requires the deployment of genuine international peacekeeping forces in south ossetia and abkhazia the current escalation of military conflict resulted in part from the lack of a neutral and effective peacekeeping force operating under an appropriate un mandate russia cannot play a constructive role as peacekeeper instead russian actions in both south ossetia and abkhazia appear to be intended to preserve an unstable status quo

2808474 at the end of the day i came away with mixed feelings about the tz5 its a competent package that continues to do something relatively unique and it will still get the job done with style and speed in most cases choosing to break little from the heritage of the tz line though i cant help but feel that its not as outstanding as it easily could have been
2808475 the panasonic lumix dmc tz5 is quite an impressive package
2808476 weve been big fans of the tz series since the original panasonic lumix dmc tz1 was introduced in 2006 and panasonic keeps upping the ante in the 10x optically stabilized pocket zoom category despite a few quirks and faults such as the inability to disengage the ez mode from the one touch zoom and confusing video settings for vga and hd capture and a non included hdmi cable for hd output to your tv overall this ones a winner
2808477 this film already had some exposure this film has been reviewed this film has played at a festival this film has a response this film has an online presence this film has the beginnings of an audience or a niche audience

2808480 i think what bernie mac did that few if any have been able to do was become a success here in chicago
2808481 most of our homegrown talent has to go to l a or new york to become famous but bernie he was selling out the chicago theater before he went out to new york thats next to impossible
2808482 whats interesting about bernies career is that he wasnt a mainstream comic at first his act was very edgy and very raw
2808483 bernie would talk about things that other black comics wouldnt talk about like skin color and how being a very dark skinned black man like him made his life very different from other peoples
2808484 he didnt so much cross over as people crossed over to him
2808485 you got to come with a little extra to satisfy them
2808486 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there

2808522 i would like to say this tardiness is not something you can do on your own many many people contributed to my tardiness i would like to thank my parents for never giving me a ride to school the la city bus driver who took a chance on an unknown kid and last but not least the wonderful crew from mcdonalds who spend hours making those egg mcmuffins without which id never be tardy

2808540 as a result doe has eliminated the project specific proposals for the siting construction and operation of a nuclear fuel recycling center an advanced recycling center and an advanced fuel cycle research facility
2808541 were not at the stage right now to pick a site
2808542 its all code language for saying that this isnt going to happen
2808543 the biggest issue is that gnep had lost a lot of its impetus within congress
2808544 the congresswomans position has been that she will do what the local community wants her to do if they want her to push for the consideration of this project then she will
2808545 congress has not provided much funding for this project so she has been focusing much of her attention on making sure the cleaning continues
2808546 there was a sense of uncertainty about it for some time
2808547 the governor did support the communitys efforts to attract this project but there were certain conditions that the community felt were necessary for the recycling plant they were seeking a commitment that this site would not become a nuclear dumping ground
2808548 the governor thinks that this location and the highly skilled work force in the area are great assets to the state
2808549 this administration is not going to figure out anything and all of this is going to be left to the next administration so all options are open
2808550 lt cadman just checked in from m39 786 theyre getting an odd power reading that dr haglund cant explain
2808551 im getting a reading thats very strange i cant make any sense out of it

2808553 haglund and cadman just checked in haglund is getting a power reading he cant explain i need to join them and check it out
2808554 that if it turns out to be an ancient energy weapon i wont activate it
2808555 so do i have your authorization to go check out the energy reading or would you prefer i send someone else
2808556 if it does turn out to be something we can use please check back with me before you do anything
2808557 im joining you ill be there in approximately fifteen minutes
2808558 i thought you said there was an interesting energy reading
2808559 i didnt pick it up until we were well into the forest
2808560 the hike will do you good put some color into your cheeks
2808561 can we just go and get this over with im in the middle of an important experiment ive had to put on hold
2808562 i see why you couldnt make any sense out of these readings haglund
2808563 yes cadman i am when something doesnt make any sense i admit to not understanding it interacting with you comes to mind
2808564 if only 0 3 of the worlds current nuclear armaments were used it would create a nuclear winter and the end of humanity on this planet
2808565 the world has come perilously close to nuclear annihilation over the past decades we should continue to call for the total abolition of all nuclear weapons as a threat to life on this planet

2808580 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2808581 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2808582 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2808583 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2808584 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2808585 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2808586 overall i feel like we obviously didnt play well as a team
2808587 i was disappointed that some of them nonstarters didnt do better
2808588 weve been having a good training camp were excited to come out and play with the confidence weve had so far we have so many veterans when we step on the field we feel confident we should score
2808589 i havent played football in a year so its a little cool i love competing it wont be like this for long
2808590 i just have to work on my tackling i think everything else will come along i did ok guarding people for being out for a little while
2808591 i see theyve got the hoary old beat up on single parents
2808592 ive got one view on that whatever we do with single parents we have got to be guided by what is in the best interest of the children and its not always in the best interest of every child that mum is at work all day
2808593 and the truth is most people on the dpb are not there for very long
2808594 im all in favour of supporting single parents to get into work but in the final analysis we have to be guided by what is in the best interest of the children in a particular family
2808595 theyve got a lot of things going on in their lives and to tell a single parent they have a work obligation can be too tough
2808596 lets get pregnant then i wont need to find a job
2808597 they were always the hometown airline they were in the downtown parades they invested in the community
2808598 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2808599 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts
2808600 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about
2808601 the more you raise fees the more you drive airlines and customers away
2808602 its rhetoric ive heard for 41 years but i understand
2808603 these folks arent sure if theyre going to be in business in six months
2808604 on the other hand airports are very dependent on the airlines bringing passengers
2808605 if it was maintained and we were successful in pulling that data off it it might yield such things as the speed of the vehicle at the time of the collision and whether the driver was applying the accelerator or was applying the brakes
2808606 its a chain of events that leads to an accident
2808607 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2808608 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2808609 je ne passerai jamais sous silence les atteintes aux droits de lhomme au nom de nos int r ts conomiques
2808610 it dug in and made a funny noise well my leg did
2808611 i thought heck that hurts a lot and you just start to feel so helpless
2808612 they were holed up in their snow cave mr holden was obviously in pain but we literally dragged him out to the helicopter and he was quite happy
2808613 he had only been given some paracetamol by his companion so it was quite surprising

2808625 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2808626 i want to enjoy my life a little bit i missed a lot of things you know
2808627 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2808628 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2808629 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
2808630 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
2808631 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital
2808632 girl you better come on board this train because im going to be rich
2808633 not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly
2808634 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2808635 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2808636 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2808637 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2808638 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2808639 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2808640 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2808641 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
2808642 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2808643 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit
2808644 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2808645 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous
2808646 sam and lindsay are unbelievably happy and in a healthy relationship
2808647 and like any couple in love they speak about marriage and the future but right now there is no wedding planned
2808648 he is a guy who last year was slated as a starter and started a few games before his shoulder injury took him out of the lineup and he had to sit out
2808649 he is a little behind the eight ball because he missed so much time and wasnt able to practice all spring but i think he gets the message right now that he is working with the second unit and he has to work his way up to that first unit
2808650 ideally hell come on and start dominating people like he can and get back into the starting lineup
2808651 the best thing between this morning and afternoon was quarterback play overall and they all played with billy stull and pat bostick both up in the 80 percentile as far as completions and thats where they both should be in my opinion when were out here practicing and not scrimmaging i think both guys responded the way youd like them to kevan smith was better today greg cross and ill tell you tino sunseri made two throws this morning that were as good as any throws weve had from starters i was real encouraged how the quarterbacks as a group responded after the first few days that gives us a chance to have an upbeat practice there were no interceptions except at the end and that was a tipped pass no mistakes we got rid of the ball quick and that helps the practice go smooth tomorrow we go with the entire team no practice in the morning full practice in the afternoon and i would expect another surge of energy now that we are all back together i look forward to that well have some live stuff tomorrow a live inside drill for sure this will be my 34th first day of pads live inside drill
2808652 i think its a combination of them responding blocking a little better the plays that we put together probably gave them a little better chance to be successful jonathan baldwin made some plays today mike shanahan made some plays today cameron saddler made some plays it was good to see thats three outstanding freshman receivers thats a unique group right there
2808653 elijah is such a good coverage guy were talking about using him in some nickel and dime situations to get both of those guys on the field
2808654 damn thats really cool i have to know how to do something like that
2808655 pshht all you have to do is change jobs stop smoking eat a salad
2808656 an almost hysterical antagonism toward the gold standard is an issue that unites statists of all persuasions they seem to sense that gold and economic freedom are inseparable

2808834 leading employers organisation the cbi will this week perform a significant u turn and warn its members that the economy is deteriorating at a faster rate than it had predicted as recently as june richard lambert the cbis director general took a relatively optimistic view saying we should avoid talking ourselves into recession but in a letter to mark the first anniversary of the credit crunch he writes there is no doubt that the mood has darkened in the last two or three months and warns that growth prospects for next year and 2010 look no better than anaemic it is the most pessimistic assessment of britains economic prospects that lambert has delivered the cbis change of heart is notable because although it downgraded its growth forecast for 2009 reducing it from 1 per cent to 0 4 per cent in june it has been comparatively bullish about the british economy until now lambert also warns the government against levying an arbitrary and unfair windfall tax on energy companies saying this would stop them investing in infrastructure he concedes that the cbi along with most other forecasters has been consistently over optimistic about the economic outlook over the past 12 months he blamed the volte face on a surge in inflation that took us by surprise and the prolonged credit crunch which has been bigger and broader than at first appeared likely a year ago it seemed reasonable to hope that the worst would by over by now that has not turned out to be the case

2808837 the thing is an all wheel drive not a four wheel drive the difference is that all wheel while itll off road pretty well and ive done it isnt designed for off road performance really rather its for cornering and for wet weather and winter traction in short its designed for the roads i drive on around here
2808838 cornering between the all wheel drive and the air ride suspension it handles better than any stock econobox on the road
2808839 i may as well be comfortable the buick has that one covered secondly i have a family my wife and i are both 6 footers and we have two boys and a dog on the face of it were not going to fit us and our stuff into a prius and i tow a 5000lb camper you simply cant do that with a smaller rig for example the largest vehicle honda makes the ridgeline cant tow my trailer and yet it gets the same gas mileage while developing far less power
2808840 what its an suv those things swill gas like no tommrow pause what kind of mileage can it get anyway
2808841 oh about 22 on the open road give or take a headwind
2808842 thats more horsepower than my old pony car used to have and i didnt get gas mileage numbers anywhere near that
2808843 less displacement too ill bet but thats how the technology has improved
2808844 why not one of those four door pickups for towing then
2808845 simple the gas mileage isnt as good and this fits in my driveway better
2808846 plus the rig we got has heated leather inside all the toys and tricks youd expect to find on a buick and it was cheaper to begin with
2808847 let me tell you something the h3 has a smaller engine than my rig does and it gets about the same milage
2808848 yep kinda makes you think twice about all those suv stereotypes weve been fed eh
2808849 yeah but what kinda milage do you get when youre pulling that trailer
2808850 now a campsite even one with full hookups at the peak of the season will never cost more than around 40 a night i generallly go for the ones running 25 or 30 might so lets add the costs up
2808851 now from my front door to the campsite we hooked up with is 380 miles lets assume were getting 10mpg the whole way thats way low on what we usually get but lets keep it there for round numbers easier to figure with me so far
2808852 ok that means were at 64 gallons of gas for the round trip
2808853 add to that the costs of hotels and restaurants every meal ends up being around 50
2808854 full stove microwave fridge even a grill if youre in the mood for it we bring food from home in other words we eat what wed be eating at home anyway far healthir than road food and cheaper too we figured it out once and it amounts to 125 to 150 per day and thats more than enough savings to cover the fuel expense particularly if youre staying for a few days even at todays fuel prices
2808855 usually may to late october weve even camped in november though thats rare its got central heat and an air conditioner
2808856 ok youve convinced me its a cheap way to vacation but you have to drive the tow rig the rest of the year
2808857 and youre right it costs me more than the average econo box but see thats the beauty of this thing it runs rings around just about every car out there and a lot of the trucks too since i dont have to switch in and out of 4 wheel drive mode and its a buick so its got a bit of class about it

2808885 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family
2808886 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2808887 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2808888 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2808889 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2808890 we are heartbroken he will be deeply missed he was a wonderful kind and gentle man
2808891 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2808892 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2808893 bernie mac was a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place he was a tremendous live performer and a wonderful actor fox was proud to be the home of the bernie mac show and all of us at fox and 20th century fox television extend our deepest sympathies to his wife rhonda and daughter jeniece
2808894 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
2808895 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally costarred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2808896 bernie mac was a brilliant performer whose legacy will bring laughter to all of us for many years to come the thoughts of everyone at the weinstein company and hugh downs reports

2808904 its just like a dream come true and i hope everyone can share in this dream its been a very long journey to get here so many people have helped me and i really hope they have the same feelings as i do

2808909 what is needed is an organization that can guide and coordinate activities in the area of renewable energy on an international level so that their impacts are maximized
2808910 to date only a minority of states have shown themselves willing or able to introduce efficient renewable energy policies including appropriate legislation and institutional frameworks develop effective industries assess their national potential and promote research development education and training
2808911 we now need to disseminate best practices and lessons learned in order to give countries wishing to profit from the many benefits of using renewable energy the support they need to exploit their vast domestic potential irena will carry out a broad range of activities to meet these needs
2808912 promote the fast adoption and the sustainable use of renewable energy worldwide taking account of its contribution to security of supply environment and climate protection economic growth and social cohesion regional development and inter generational equity

2808932 in my opinion energy and global warming are two of the most urgent problems our new president will face when he or she takes office exactly 360 days from now but i am astonished that instead of the presidential candidates facing tough questions about their plans to solve these two problems on the campaign trail something else is happening something very frustrating to me america is at a critical crossroads and who our next president is and the decisions she or he makes will make all the difference in determining the health safety and well being of our country what truly are these reporters waiting for
2808933 we havent licensed a nuclear power plant in 30 years france is 80 percent nuclear were 20 percent nuclear were going down to 15 percent nuclear we have to crack through there
2808934 i am confident american technology and the embrace of green technologies many of the things that rudy just talked about and nuclear power being one of them we can reduce these greenhouse gas emissions
2808935 it isnt like we didnt know that the son of a millworker was a little enraptured by himself
2808936 i made a decision on my own without talking to edwards or anybody to try to help them move to a community to try to get away from those folks
2808937 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2808938 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2808939 as congress considers policies to address air quality and the deleterious effects of carbon emissions on the global ecosystem it is reasonable and realistic for nuclear power to remain on the table for consideration
2808940 this is where a shift in mainstream public thinking is so important if public priority rests only on a superficial short term understanding of a healthy economy as opposed to a deeper long term understanding of economic sustainability then business as usual may persevere for yet another presidential term in the united states the nation with the greatest responsibility ability to foster and encourage change

2808942 the kid will be asleep ten minutes after it stars and well never hear about it again
2808943 was fourteen when i first saw a night at the opera and instantly i fell in love with the marx brothers now i have a collection of their movies even grouchos three solo films radio and television shows and of course books i think it is sad that they only made thirteen movies together for me thats not enough i also have a huge collection of the works of other comedians but i never could get the same amount of joy out of them
2808944 the first rarity to my credit was a still from a night at the opera which you can see on mikael uhlins marxology site i was lucky to find it on an auction site
2808945 but i didnt give much chance to it then the guy who sold me the still wrote me an e mail and told me that he has another one it was yet another scene that isnt in the movie i e mailed it to the marxology site
2808946 checked the list of films in the hungarian national film archive to find that our copy of a night at the opera is 95 minutes long and the copy is from 1935
2808947 got into the projection room and rolled the first reel
2808948 when i saw the splice after the credits i thought that this is the same print i have on dvd so the after credit splice is there unfortunately
2808949 decided to watch the first reel because i paid for it i didnt expect anything new then i saw the yet unknown shot of lasparri who isnt lasparri at all and i got a weird feeling as the reel went on it contained extra sentences and shots ive discussed earlier therefore i think ive found something even if its not what i was hoping for
2808950 from then on everybody said that this is the complete uncut version which is an exaggeration i think but i might be wrong because the cut could have been made before the film got out in 1935
2808951 i presume that this is the original cut and not an after war one my theory is that thalberg cut that scene after the failed preview screening to make the movie tighter it is a rough cut which is why i think it was made by thalberg who was in a hurry to get the reel ready for a second screening
2808952 i never said this is the original uncut print i just reported what ive found
2808953 it would be useless to see another reel because seeing and knowing is one thing and doing something with it is another
2808954 the people at the archive absolutely refused to lend me the print let alone to do something with it im currently waiting for a message
2808955 i deliberately didnt contact the press because the only thing they can do is to write down somebody in a far away country has seen a print of a classic movie but he cant do anything with it so thats that
2808956 i think im the only one in this country who couldve noticed the differences because i memorized all the dialog i love the marx brothers i love classical american comedy and i also love your site
2808957 i once made a presentation about the life of jerry lewis and your site was the ideal one to find pictures i thank you for those
2808958 the number primary care physicians leaving traditional practice is a precious few i estimate their numbers at less than 1 of practicing physicians although i can find no single source to document their actual numbers the success of these practices depends on the willingness of patients to pay out of pocket for more personal more convenient care

2808999 the embroidery does not follow the order of the plan nor any order recognizable as that of the events they have all lived through one day horses falling in battle the next king william and his brothers commissioning ships to be built a morning on a saxon peasants pursued by norman knights wielding whips and afternoon on the exploits of harold fighting alongside william against conan of brittany heroically rescuing a man from drowning in a river writhing with giant eels some days working upside down before switching sides with your partner and seeing the strange world of wool and linen right way up again these partnerships ever changing the women switching from one frame to another as they complete a figure or a scene
2809000 yet the embroidery is real enough the wool stinking of the sheeps piss used to set the dyes the linen taut as drumskins in the frames men and horse ships and city walls emerging from the tangle of needles and thread and charcoal lines as the world came out of chaos though a great deal more slowly it can take a week or more to complete a single suit of mail overlapping the stitches so densely that you can almost imagine the woolen replica would offer as much protection as the real thing building up ring by ring the fishscale effect that sometimes reminds gytha of accompanying her father to the early morning market his great red gentle hands lifting the gills of the fish to test their freshness and you can eke out the process further by snapping needles rubbing out sister jeans guidelines so mistakes ensue and have to be unpicked
2809001 last winter gytha lost track of the time she and margaret spent embroidering the image of a norman abbey called mont saint michel its dainty arches balanced on a folded hill of sage green and ochre its roof ridged with yellow gold a place impossible outside the imagination of god yet built by these two with their aching backs and smarting fingers stiff with cold their tips swollen with chillblains like overripe plums even if they could work the complete cycle of the hours without stopping for food or rest the project might take so many years its patron would be in the grave before it was complete

2809008 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2809009 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2809010 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2809011 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2809012 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2809018 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2809019 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2809020 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2809340 ive got one view on that whatever we do with single parents we have got to be guided by what is in the best interest of the children and its not always in the best interest of every child that mum is at work all day
2809341 and the truth is most people on the dpb are not there for very long
2809342 im all in favour of supporting single parents to get into work but in the final analysis we have to be guided by what is in the best interest of the children in a particular family
2809343 theyve got a lot of things going on in their lives and to tell a single parent they have a work obligation can be too tough
2809344 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2809345 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2809346 i knew nothing about the business or trends and things like that

2809372 it felt real good being back out there with my teammates
2809373 i was a little bit rusty at first after taking two weeks off but im good now and ready to go
2809374 when youre not playing you have to look at the guys on the field watch a lot of film and sort of put yourself in their shoes
2809375 there was a struggle the suspect pulled out a long barrel handgun and proceeded to hit her upon the face with the gun

2809378 unless the west commits serious numbers of extra troops soon we are looking at a taliban victory
2809379 it definitely was and i spoke with dario on the phone and i said that view is pretty sweet coming through turn 3 and turn 4 and seeing helio run out of gas and blowing by him with a few hundred feet to go was pretty special i must say its definitely nice to be in that position
2809380 i have to describe the bold feelings that when i was going into turn 3 i thought i got it
2809381 i didnt want the car to stop right away i didnt know how many cars were behind dixon and marco i just wanted to keep finish the race as high as i could as soon as i coughed i tried to coast and lift it and make sure that it kept collecting fuel
2809382 if i was forced low i was able to stay flat out on the bottom if i had just gotten in the track position i dont think anybody was going to come around me so thats why we are a little bummed because i think we might have had the car to win but yeah like especially in traffic i think i felt definitely stronger than the majority of my competitors and i could put my car pretty much where i wanted and that was the goal going into the race
2809383 everyone did a good job and we cant complain everyone wanted to win and we put ourselves into position to do that it was a good finish and this gives us momentum going into the next race and the rest of the season
2809384 we gained points and we gained everything else so we are happy that we had an overall good day even though we would have liked to see the win
2809385 helio could quite easily have gained on us and made it more of a fight so definitely with sonoma and chicago and belle isle tracks that those guys are very good at as well and so we are going to make sure we dont lose too many points
2809386 but it would be nice to gain a couple on helio in sonoma and maybe we only need 82 points or something to have it sewn up by the end that would be nice but all reality i think well be racing almost till the last race

2809403 the religious sense of life has to do with exposing oneself to the radical uncertainty and the open endedness of life which is meaning giving salt giving risk taking religion on my telling is a pact or covenant with the impossible to have a religious sense of life is to long with a restless heart for a reality beyond reality to tremble with the possibility of the impossible

2809405 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
2809406 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
2809407 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
2809408 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
2809409 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
2809410 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2809411 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter

2809425 girls do have wiis nintendo at 9 i wanted a canopy bed and a pony my daughter wants an iphone this is the world our girls live in there is more of a challenge more media more culture to assimilate and tease out and so much of it is very appealing
2809426 theres something to be said about pastimes that girls have always had to remember some of that too its nice that sometimes they can have very solitary creative pursuits without having to blog about it
2809427 for a girl to be earnest about what she likes to speak up it is kind of daring to include a recipe in a book for girls when we know so much about how girls are limited its daring to reclaim these things this everyday daring like raising your hand in class
2809428 doesnt have to choose to be sparkly or daring she can be both she can be a budding technology geek who also plays soccer the world is a big place

2809475 he was one of the most natural people at what he does that ive seen he said

2809492 but he said he didnt think it would be too long and he would be back to ready to go
2809493 it will be at least a few days that they will keep him out and keep watching it scott locker said
2809494 guesses a new ad will be named soon that he wasnt speaking for president
2809495 i think there is personally its time for me to do one job full time

2809498 in any process the total energy of the universe remains the same more simply energy cannot be created or destroyed rather the amount of energy lost in a steady state process cannot be greater than the amount of energy gained
2809499 as a system approaches absolute zero all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value in simple terms the entropy of a pure substance approaches zero as the absolute temperature approaches zero this law provides an absolute reference point for the determination of entropy the entropy determined relative to this point is the absolute entropy

2809508 well some of the ads that sen mccain has been running i just scratch my head at them
2809509 i mean they really kind of seem out of touch with what the issues are
2809510 the whole ad about you know the paris hilton and the celebrity thing i mean it was funny but wearing a clown suit and juggling would be funny too but it doesnt connect with the concerns americans have about gas prices about the war about the economy
2809511 so i think on things like that shoot i hope the mccain camp does more of those ads and well just let him do those ads

2809530 organising something on the scale of the lambeth conference will inevitably result in a small deficit sometimes
2809531 the archbishops council met last week to propose a solution
2809532 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2809533 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2809534 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2809535 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2809536 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2809537 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2809538 i would be very direct with russian president vladimir putin that these actions will have consequences long term in terms of our relationship with russia and it is in violation of the norms of international conduct
2809539 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately
2809540 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign

2809543 you could argue that no one is ever ready to be president
2809544 competition can create some challenging feelings but the democrats have shown again and again that we get on board and that we work together
2809545 the stakes are very very high i know that both senator clinton and president clinton will have key roles in the convention and i expect that once were there that everybody is going to be together in a great way to do a historic job of turning out democratic voters and also independent and disgruntled republican voters for barack obama in november
2809546 theres a danger of there being too much of the clinton family at the convention its important that we acknowledge bill clinton as a great former president its important that senator clintons public service record and her historic candidacy be acknowledged and so sure look lionizing and appreciating the great leaders of the party is something that we always do at these conventions and this one will be no different but it is all part of a unified effort
2809547 but i can tell you this hillary clinton and president clinton are integral parts of our convention in denver their people are not only welcome to this convention we need their help
2809548 now lets understand weve gone through a bruising primary season between these two excellent candidates and there are some people still healing from that i understand it but in the end i believe that the hillary clinton supporters and hillary herself are definitely committed to obamas candidacy
2809549 im holding a fundraiser two fundraisers actually for her next week to retire her debt we as democrats have to come together so i dont believe a roll call would be helpful
2809550 important for us to be strong against senator mccain who will be a formidable opponent
2809551 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade

2809563 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2809564 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2809565 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2809566 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2809567 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2809568 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2809569 yeah everyone sort of knows but like what are we going to do
2809570 lm an awful dancer i cant move to save my life
2809571 the results of the survey so far show that although most companies understand the importance of having business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place there seems to be a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding the technologies that are currently available to deliver reliable and fast recovery in the event of a system failure these days it is not enough to blindly trust that backups are being completed properly businesses and the regulatory environment in which we all exist demand fast and reliable recovery time objectives for it systems such is the pace at which a modern company transacts business these days that those who are without their it for any great length of time are losing serious money customers are also becoming a lot more aware of the information that companies hold and are getting less and less forgiving about delivery disruption let alone the thought of their sensitive data being transported in a an unencrypted and readable format
2809572 this change in causes of data loss can possibly be attributed to improvements in software and hardware resiliency in the last two years which has reduced the number of hardware and software failures affecting computers changing the way these threats need to be addressed in business continuity and disaster recovery plans moving forward
2809573 since the burmese military has ignored the call of the internal national community to begin an inclusive political process and unilaterally imposed a constitution designed to consolidate military rule it is imperative to review the international approach towards burma
2809574 a full blown castigation of the burmese generals could have caused considerable discomfort for bangkok which has just assumed the chair of asean which includes burma
2809575 church 2 0 gives church leaders permission to innovate and create new ways to bring hope and help to the world which so desperately needs to know gods love

2809577 we have said that this is a condition driven process
2809578 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2809579 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
2809580 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
2809581 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
2809582 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
2809583 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
2809584 we have said that this is a condition driven process

2809598 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2809599 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2809600 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2809601 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2809602 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2809603 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2809604 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2809605 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
2809606 today iran is friends with american and israeli people no nation in the world is our enemy this is an honor
2809607 the tank force that went into afghanistan in 1979 or czechoslovakia in 1968
2809608 lets state clearly that we are ready to put an end to the war that we will withdraw from south ossetia that we will sign an agreement on non use of force

2809615 if we bring him back too soon hell probably miss the year
2809616 we need to make sure if a guy can practice even though hes nicked up he needs to practice
2809617 they wanted to make sure they got in and got the bone in place last night which is the easier part of the procedure
2809618 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever

2809625 russia had to move in if only to save face
2809626 should russia confine its efforts to south ossetia it still might emerge out of this mess as the power who moved in to stop bloodshed
2809627 should russia move further into georgia it will be deemed the aggressor
2809628 the personhood amendment could be something that gets social conservatives out to vote
2809629 a kind of 1930s style conflict between unions and management

2809657 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2809658 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2809659 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2809660 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal

2809703 even when women are facing a breast cancer diagnosis they are still concerned about caring for everyone else especially the emotions of others
2809704 even telling someone i have breast cancer its well thought out
2809705 women are trying to protect older aging parents and younger children and even their spouses even during illness women are socialized to care about others
2809706 its a time they should be caring about themselves what decisions they should be making about breast cancer they shouldnt emotionally burn themselves out by caring for others emotions
2809707 we tell women to seek out other breast cancer survivors other women who understand to increase their resources

2809709 if we consider mankind as a whole and substitute it for a single individual we discover that it too has developed delusions which are inaccessible to logical criticism and which contradict reality if in spite of this they the delusions are able to exert an extraordinary power over men investigation leads us to the same explanation as in the case of the single individual they owe their power to the element of historical truth which they have brought up from the repression of the forgotten and primeval past

2809711 i have to make all the right judgments as far as my health as far as my ankle before i go out there on the football field
2809712 when i go out on that football field i want to be running 100 mph with no restrictions thats what i am trying to accomplish being on the sidelines getting healthy and going out and being explosive and jumping up in the air and catching ball
2809713 i probably could get out there but i want be to my normal self like i know i can and thats what i want to accomplish
2809714 why wouldnt everybody want that from me i think everyone would be a lot happier when i am 100 percent i know my quarterback would be i dont see why there is a problem

2809719 i am going to go out and do things that i am capable of doing when i get healthy i think everybody around here will have a lot of appreciation for that when i am on the football field when i am healthy

2809755 there are a lot of middle aged men and women who i know that tell me that im an inspiration to them and theyre now doing things they thought they couldnt do
2809756 im hoping that my age paves the way for other athletes who maybe think theyre too old to do something
2809757 i was starting to swing the bat a little better the team is playing good
2809758 it was just a big disappointment for something like this to happen
2809759 yeah probably could be thats why im going back to tampa
2809760 there have been a lot of big hits hes had hitting in the three hole for us
2809761 one thing about carl he has a propensity to come through in those moments thats what ive seen thee last couple of years this guy gets big hits
2809762 we have the mechanics within what we have right now if we choose to do something else we can do that also
2809763 so and so invites you to play yet another game
2809764 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2809765 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2809766 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2809767 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2809768 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2809769 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2809770 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2809771 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2809772 the japanese government must strongly demand complete abolishment of nuclear weapons in north korea
2809773 it should seriously consider the creation of a northeast asian nuclear weapon free zone
2809774 india whose nuclear cooperation with the united states is a cause of concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt
2809775 it was a deadly weapon that has also afflicted survivors for the rest of their lives
2809776 it was a little disconcerting to see all the problems with the signatures
2809777 the last couple of days ive been checking the registrations myself on the computer
2809778 i want at least one debate with all four candidates so that nancy pelosi has to answer for her record
2809779 the one constant in republican victories in fall elections has been large margins in springfield and those surrounding counties
2809780 if you dont campaign hard in a region of the state that is growing that represents a lot of votes
2809781 a good performing republican will get 65 percent of the vote in greene and surrounding counties
2809782 this race will be fought and won in the margins
2809783 if youre a democrat and cant get north of 40 percent in greene county youre in trouble
2809784 a lot of things hes said have really turned off and angered a lot of people including greene county democrats
2809785 the threat of obama is enough to get the hard core conservatives out
2809786 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2809787 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2809788 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2809789 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2809790 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2809791 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2809792 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2809793 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2809794 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2809795 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2809796 cheated on more times than a blind woman playing scrabble with gypsies
2809797 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2809798 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2809799 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2809800 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2809801 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2809802 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2809803 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2809804 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2809805 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2809806 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2809807 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2809808 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2809809 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2809810 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2809811 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2809812 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2809813 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2809814 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2809815 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2809816 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2809817 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2809818 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2809819 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2809820 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2809821 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2809822 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2809823 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2809824 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2809825 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2809826 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2809827 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2809828 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2809829 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2809830 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2809831 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2809832 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2809833 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2809834 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2809835 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2809836 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2809837 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2809838 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2809839 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2809840 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2809841 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2809842 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2809843 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2809844 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2809845 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2809846 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2809847 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2809848 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2809849 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2809850 is designed to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind
2809851 loony liberalism a kind of ideological m nage a trois between timothy leary karl marx and al gore
2809852 matriarchal environmentalist multicultural anti male anti family anti individual and public hygiene shibboleths are enforced by orwellian regulatory agencies commissions and tribunals better known as the smoke smut seat belt thought language and calorie police
2809853 richtig und wenn ihn niemand t tet dann radiert er die ganze welt aus
2809854 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
2809855 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
2809856 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
2809857 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
2809858 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
2809859 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2809860 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2809861 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2809862 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2809863 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2809864 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2809865 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2809866 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2809867 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2809868 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2809869 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2809870 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2809871 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2809872 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2809873 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2809874 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2809875 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2809876 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2809877 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2809878 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2809879 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2809880 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2809881 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2809882 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2809883 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2809884 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2809885 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2809886 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2809887 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2809888 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2809889 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2809890 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2809891 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2809892 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2809893 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2809894 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2809895 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2809896 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2809897 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2809898 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2809899 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2809900 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2809901 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2809902 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2809903 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2809904 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2809905 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2809906 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2809907 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2809908 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2809909 just so you all know we did set a record
2809910 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2809911 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2809912 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2809913 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
2809914 a number of utilities have reported that only 20 percent to 30 percent of their customers are aware that a green power option is offered
2809915 thats confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
2809916 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program
2809917 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
2809918 as much as 1 billion on renewable generation over the next 10 years
2809919 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that
2809920 but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
2809921 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2809922 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2809923 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2809924 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2809925 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2809926 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2809927 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2809928 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2809929 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2809930 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2809931 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2809932 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2809933 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2809934 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2809935 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2809936 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2809937 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2809938 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2809939 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2809940 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2809941 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2809942 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2809943 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2809944 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2809945 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2809946 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2809947 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2809948 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2809949 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2809950 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2809951 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2809952 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2809953 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2809954 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2809955 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2809956 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2809957 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2809958 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2809959 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2809960 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2809961 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2809962 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
2809963 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
2809964 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2809965 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2809966 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2809967 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2809968 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2809969 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2809970 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2809971 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2809972 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2809973 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2809974 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2809975 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
