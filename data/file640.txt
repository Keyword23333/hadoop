6400073 he has a pro style game with his length athleticism and ability to rush the passer
6400074 its not always about how many sacks you have its how you fit into a pro system
6400075 its not a question of whether hes got to make a name for himself
6400076 he already has what he needs to do is take advantage of his standing he needs to have a great year go play in the senior bowl and dominate people if he does that he has the physical capabilities to be a top 10 pick
6400077 but i try not to look at that kind of stuff i just go out and work hard every day and focus i kind of have an underdog mentality to go out and get better every day i never get content

6400080 this kid has worked to get himself in the position hes in
6400081 i talked to michael about his goals what he wanted to do where he wanted to be he stressed that he wanted to play in college and in the nfl we set goals for him and he reached every one of them by the time he graduated
6400082 heres a kid whos 6 7 and 260 pounds and probably runs a sub 4 6 40 yard dash
6400083 he can jump out of the gym change direction and hes got a great motor

6400085 hes fought some injury problems nothing major just some little stuff hes got to go out there and be an every down player hes got tremendous upside hes got great athletic ability physically hes a freak
6400086 in the nfl the two priorities are defensive ends or outside linebackers who can get to the quarterback and cover corners
6400087 theyre the kind of guys who dont make it to free agency too often they get re signed early or get franchised if theres a talented defensive end with the ability to get to the quarterback they dont last long
6400088 theres no such thing as a lock first round pick but hes going to have to have a great year which he should have
6400089 ive been playing ball since i was 10 years old expectations are from other people my expectations are always to do my best and to do well those are the expectations i have for myself i dont really worry about what other peoples expectations are most of the time im going to hold myself to a higher standard than anyone else

6400094 which is not only necessary but essential for his defence
6400095 has held that the uk government is under a duty to disclose evidence which it holds about the treatment of binyam mohamed between his detention by pakistani authorities in april 2002 and his subsequent reappearance in bagram air base in july 2004
6400096 we are considering the implications of this judgment very carefully we have never contested that mr mohameds defence lawyers should have access to information which would assist him in his defence in any trial at guantanamo bay
6400097 the court recognised the strenuous efforts that we have made to assist mr mohamed in guantanamo bay including efforts to ensure that the information hmg holds which relates to a small part of mr mohameds account of what happened to him is made available to him for purposes of his defence in any prosecution in the us system
6400098 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily
6400099 i spoke with madrid sporting director pedja mijatovic and with madrid president ramon calderon and they told me that robinho has to stay that he cannot leave

6400113 i stephanie tubbs jones a representative from ohio and ms boxer a senator from california object to the counting of the electoral votes of the state of ohio on the ground that they were not under all of the known circumstances regularly given
6400114 i thank god that i have a senator joining me in this objection
6400115 while some have called our cause foolish i can assure you that my parents mary and andrew tubbs did not raise any fools and as a lawyer former judge and prosecutor i am duty bound to follow the law and apply the law to the facts as i find them
6400116 it is on behalf of those millions of americans who believe in and value our democratic process and the right to vote that i put forth this objection today
6400117 this objection does not have at its root the hope or even the hint of overturning or challenging the victory of the president but it is a necessary timely and appropriate opportunity to review and remedy the most precious process in our democracy
6400118 i raise this objection neither to put the nation in the turmoil of a proposed overturned election nor to provide cannon fodder or partisan demagoguery for my fellow republican members of congress
6400119 i raise this objection because i am convinced that we as a body must conduct a formal and legitimate debate about election irregularities i raise this objection to debate the process and protect the integrity of the true will of the people
6400120 again i thank senator boxer for joining me in this objection to the counting of ohios electoral votes due to the considerable number of voting irregularities that transpired in my home state
6400121 there are serious allegations in two lawsuits pending in ohio that debate the constitutionality of the denial of provisional ballots to voters the sandusky county democratic party v
6400122 moreover as you are aware advancing legislative initiatives is more challenging when you are in the minority party in congress however this challenge is multiplied when you are in the minority in the house of representatives because of house rules compared to senate rules
6400123 voting irregularities were an issue after the 2000 presidential election when democratic house initiatives relating to election reform were not considered
6400124 therefore in order to prevent our voices from being kept silent it is imperative that we object to the counting of ohios electoral votes and debate the issue of ohios voting improprieties
6400125 there are just over 1 million registered voters in cuyahoga county which of course includes the greater cleveland area and the 11th congressional district which i represent registration increased approximately 10 percent
6400126 the beauty of the 2004 election was that more people were fully prepared to exercise their right to vote however on election day hundreds and even thousands of individuals went to the voting polls and were denied the opportunity to have their vote count
6400127 in my own county where citizen volunteers put forth a herculean effort to register educate mobilize and protect the vote there were people who experienced irregularities
6400128 poor and minority communities had disproportionately long waits 4 to 5 hours waits were widespread
6400129 came from columbus and cleveland where a huge proportion of the states democratic voters live
6400130 cuyahoga county had an overall provisional ballot rejection rate of 32 percent rejection rates for provisional ballots in african american precincts wards in cleveland ohio averaged 37 percent and ranged as high as 51 percent
6400131 thousands of partisan challengers concentrated in cuyahoga countys minority and democratic communities effectively served to intimidate voters and confuse poll workers there were both inconsistent and illegal requests for photo identification
6400132 there were problems with absentee ballots including incorrect information provided to voters by the secretary of state and consequently the cuyahoga county board of elections telling voters they could not vote in their precinct effectively disenfranchising hundreds and more likely thousands of voters
6400133 this objection points out the inadequacy of a great election system which permits 50 secretarys of state to administer a federal election and impose so many different state laws regulating the election
6400134 in ohio the secretary of state kenneth blackwell who served as co chair of the bush re election campaign issued a bizarre series of directives in the days preceding the 2004 presidential election that created tremendous confusion among voters in cuyahoga county and across the state of ohio
6400135 for example on september 7 2004 secretary blackwell issued a directive to local boards of elections mandating rejection of voter registration forms based on their paperweight 80lb text weight
6400136 my objection points to the need to implement across this nation standards that apply to all states we need to enact legislation that will
6400137 what happened in ohio may well have been repeated in counties across this country
6400138 if in fact we see it is our obligation to secure democracy around the world to monitor and oversee free and fair elections in other countries surely we must ensure protect and guarantee the right to vote right here at home

6400213 perhaps schools are focusing on quality rather than quantity they are recognising that there is no benefit to pupils to do 11 or 12 gcses it is better to have eight or nine good gcses
6400214 some students could be dropping gcses in favour of vocational qualifications he said
6400215 the national challenge schools were announced as students were walking into their exams therefore there is absolutely no connection between the national challenge and the improvements schools have made this year
6400216 schools moving above and below the arbitrary threshold of 30 per cent each year highlights the stupidity of putting a schools reputation at risk on the basis of a single years results
6400217 the reason i bring this forward is i have a request for that community and they pointed out that this is the 22nd year they had that festival over the labor day weekend into the duluth superior area
6400218 duluth welcomes the festival and i think we should get on board with welcoming them to our community thats all im asking for is just a welcome
6400219 this particular group advocates a certain lifestyle and other groups advocate other lifestyles that are in conflict with that one
6400220 youve got born again christians and different church groups that would take issue with this lifestyle i think it would be good if the council stayed out of it
6400221 i understand that some people are definitely in conflict with it

6400225 why did you write living dead girl under your own name but your other books under the name i havent been able to find confirmation about this anywhere and ived looked all over
6400226 id like to start writing burn notice books too since i wasnt thrilled with the way you handled some of the characters who do i contact
6400227 do you still count on campus groups are not the only religious options for students while many religious institutions can be found on campus there are many others in the mount pleasant area one of the larger jen in the big apple
6400228 maybe in other years id be more picky about it
6400229 people understand that this is a tough year and that rudy giuliani is admired nationally for both his success as new york mayor but also his performance after 9 11
6400230 while people have significant differences with rudy giuliani they will understand the value in showcasing him at the convention
6400231 im honored to be a keynote speaker at the republican national convention and tell the american people why john has the experience character and courage to lead the country
6400232 there is no better opportunity to remind people what i have known about john all along he is a proven leader who will put country first and tackle the tough issues head on
6400233 the mccain campaign makes decisions in what is in the best interests of the mccain campaign
6400234 john mccain is running a very powerful ad right now characterizing himself as the original maverick and as one who is ready to lead it is something that he and rudy giuliani share they have proven leadership in the toughest of times
6400235 the battleground is always in the middle its not the party regulars on the left or the right but slam dab in the center yes rudy will help with the independents but hell also rally the troops by his ability to get the convention rocking and rolling
6400236 it would seem to me that the republican party is not as far as i can tell and i have traveled to thousands of places last year a one issue party and that would just be one issue among many that would have to be evaluated by the party but i believe the party will support senator mccains choice
6400237 actually my understanding is that yesterday fox news reported the r n c said mccain is no longer considering any candidates who are pro choice to your knowledge is that incorrect
6400238 we could do a call all day about senator mccains v p choices frankly were not talking about senator mccains v p choices until he makes a v p choice
6400239 punish those involved and make adequate reparations to the families of those killed and injured
6400240 as an appropriate and tactical option to bring the matter to a safe conclusion
6400241 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6400242 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6400243 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6400244 to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance
6400245 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens

6400253 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
6400254 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
6400255 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
6400256 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
6400257 this ruling will deny physicians and other professionals the ability to freely exercise their religious convictions
6400258 by forcing healthcare professionals to choose between conscience and career we will lose doctors nurses and other healthcare professionals who are already in short supply
6400259 this was really more a matter of timing than anything else
6400260 it was not an emergency situation these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
6400261 is about discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
6400262 the physicians in this case had determined to only provide reproductive services to married patients
6400263 this decision reaches beyond the medical profession taking away the first amendment rights of healthcare professionals puts at risk the rights of every working american
6400264 not every state has something like the california law that specifically protects people from discrimination and differential treatment based upon sexual orientation so it really is a rather unique situation nationally
6400265 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
6400266 weve also had a case in minneapolis in which muslim taxi drivers from somalia originally were refusing to pick up passengers from the airport who were disembarking with duty free alcohol because it violated their religious precepts that one should not drink alcohol so they would only agree to pick up passengers who agreed to leave the alcohol behind
6400267 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
6400268 from 1963 to 1990 they took the view that at least in theory it does give somebody the right to exemption

6400273 could have an impact on us for the next 100 years

6400278 and the issue is that this week in the nfl theyre doing a youth football thing in all the stadiums and the nfl is insisting that all the kids and all the players be on the field for the anthem at the same time so it has to happen after player introductions which means they cant move it so plan b it is
6400279 since were taping the game this week we need to be cognizant of keeping the tape slightly on the short side since were going live to mike and joe and the keys to the game and it would be awkward if they kick off while were still in the tape not the way to cover the opening of the game

6400370 our experience has been and its drawn principally from iraq that when you are in an area for a while people will eventually come to trust you they rely on your security they will give you intelligence and expect you to continue to provide that security

6400372 what happens when you come back is that theres not a level of trustworthiness that youve had there among the people because you did this once before
6400373 when we leave they will either go back to being farmers or will be killed

6400380 waarom is de economische groei de afgelopen twee eeuwen zo veel hoger dan in de eeuwen daarvoor het klassieke antwoord hierop is technologische ontwikkeling dit antwoord is een beetje onbevredigend want waarom komt deze productiviteitsverhogende technologische ontwikkeling pas vanaf de 19e eeuw op gang en niet eerder de ontwikkeling van de vrijemarkteconomie speelt een grote rol bij de versnelling van economische groei de amerikaanse econoom en nobelprijswinnaar robert lucas heeft gewezen op een andere belangrijke factor de uitwisseling van idee n hij betoogt dat de geschoolde klasse die in de 19e en 20e eeuw is ontstaan van mensen die in hun levensonderhoud voorzien door het uitwisselen van idee n het oplossen van werkgerelateerde problemen en het genereren van nieuwe kennis de technologische vernieuwing in gang houdt technologische innovatie is het product van een probleemoplossende klasse van geschoolde werknemers hij wijst daarbij op het sociale of wederkerende karakter van intellectuele activiteiten iedereen profiteert van de kennis van mensen om zich heen en wordt door idee n van anderen op nieuwe idee n gebracht de inspanningen om nieuwe idee n te ontwikkelen de kwaliteit van de omgeving en de diversiteit van de omgeving vormen de bronnen van economische groei lucas theorie van economische groei is een pleidooi voor investeringen in onderwijs bedrijfsgerelateerde scholing en cursussen en maatschappelijk debat door scholing en debat worden idee n ontwikkeld en gedeeld minder scholing betekent minder nieuwe idee n en op termijn lagere economische groei

6400390 hes just blessed with an uncanny frame an uncanny quickness a huge competitive heart and he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see
6400391 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6400392 youre back there giving it everything youve got its brutal

6400397 as he gets older physically more mature he can only get faster
6400398 i cant believe it is already the middle of august
6400399 i dont mind the shorter summer considering the run we made
6400400 there are some advantages too you dont have as long to get out of shape and you dont have to work as hard to get back into shape for camp so thats nice but the bottom line is that we all want to get back there and play deep into the playoffs again it was a good experience for all of us that will be invaluable for us next spring when hopefully we get back to the playoffs we have a lot of work to do to get back there but as well as we performed we are looking forward to getting back there and it is something all of us are shooting for it obviously left us with a desire to get back there as soon as possible
6400401 we usually start training hard about five or six weeks prior to camp
6400402 thats when the pace gets picked up during the summer you try to maintain and keep your strength up and you want to feel healthy but then you kick it back in gear when camp start to approach were right at that point now and most of the guys will start skating hard this week if they havent already
6400403 i dont think anything has changed or will change for me from the playoff run
6400404 my confidence might be one thing that gets a lift from the strides we made i was always confident in my role on the team and this spring probably helped strengthen that even more it probably goes back to the vancouver series two playoffs ago the first season as captain was a tough one with the injuries and adjusting to wearing the c but i felt very comfortable when i came back late in the year and in the playoffs
6400405 i dont think theres a day that goes by that she isnt in the water she loves it
6400406 it is exciting to get back out on the ice
6400407 coming off a successful run like we had all of us are excited to get back to work and get back on the track we were on

6400439 general petraeus has by his own hand become a quintessential poster child of this fundamentalist christian religious predation via his unadulterated and shocking public endorsement of a book touting both christian supremacy and exceptionalism

6400448 the newcastle cup and metropolitan are his main goals for now and ill assess it after that
6400449 all he needed was a dry track and he didnt get it in the winter
6400450 the only time he struck a dry track was in the ipswich cup when he flashed home for third
6400451 i always thought he would win at grafton if he had a good track
6400452 ive got no doubt hes a better stayer now than when he won the brisbane cup
6400453 he only had 51 kilos in the brisbane cup and it wasnt a great year for stayers
6400454 when i took him down for the melbourne cup that year we were behind the eight ball from the start when he got a virus then last year he hurt his back in the hollindale cup which was the reason why he didnt go on to last years brisbane cup
6400455 hes been in work a long time and only has a few freshen ups every now and then
6400456 i have to prepare him that way to take the pressure off his back i cant spell him for long periods because he gets fat quickly and the only way to get him fit is to ride him which is no good for his back

6400466 good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy this congress must act to encourage conservation promote technology build infrastructure and it must act to increase energy production at home so america is less dependent on foreign oil
6400467 our third goal is to promote energy independence for our country while dramatically improving the environment applause i have sent you a comprehensive energy plan to promote energy efficiency and conservation to develop cleaner technology and to produce more energy at home
6400468 consumers and businesses need reliable supplies of energy to make our economy run so i urge you to pass legislation to modernize our electricity system promote conservation and make america less dependent on foreign sources of energy
6400469 keeping america competitive requires affordable energy and here we have a serious problem america is addicted to oil which is often imported from unstable parts of the world the best way to break this addiction is through technology since 2001 we have spent nearly 10 billion
6400470 for too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil
6400471 our security our prosperity and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil
6400472 and so we discussed a variety of strategies about how to affect the supply of oil and one way that we can affect the supply of oil is to increase access to offshore exploration on the outer continental shelf once they solve this problem they can allow us to drill in northern alaska

6400480 im very surprised i have been with mikael basically all the time ive been in the first team squad
6400481 he is a great professional and it is sad to see him go but he has not been playing many games at the moment and he wants to play so all the best to him
6400482 if he wants to go im sure it will be good for him as long as he is happy with it and plays games
6400483 it is rare to move from manchester united to arsenal but if you are going to go anywhere why not go to a good team and im sure thats what mikael will be thinking
6400484 the goal will give me confidence for the season and hopefully i can get more goals in the coming games
6400485 theres a lot of competition for places especially up front and all i can say is thats got to be good for the club its a healthy situation and the good thing is we have different types of attacking players
6400486 im not the same player as afonso alves or tuncay or jeremie aliadiere which gives the manager options for different games
6400487 i think so because they didnt know what injury i had
6400488 everybody who knows about sport injuries knows how bad it is when you get inflammation on the pubic bone i couldnt do any movement and they wouldnt have known that
6400489 i think the middlesbrough fans knew before i signed here what i can do for the team and it was a big disappointment for me last season and hopefully this season things will go right now ive got myself fit
6400490 if you are a sub and have to come on you have to prove yourself

6400633 we went through our game plan and specified exactly who is going to be cleaning out all our guys know the game plan and exactly where we want to play from so i cant say this was the problem last week but we have placed more emphasis on the specific roles of each player
6400634 plumtrees had a massive impact since joining the sharks and you can see that by how well the sharks loose forwards have played this season theyve been especially good on the cleanout so weve gained a lot of positive input from plum
6400635 we played a lot of rugby in our own half last week which obviously is not ideal
6400636 the team that has the best kicking game on the day is the team that wins any specific tri nations match we placed an emphasis on our tactical kicking in training this week
6400637 no matter how hard we may try to justify discrimination in the end it is always wrong and immoral
6400638 as reverend nancy taylor of boston put it prejudice in liturgical clothing is still prejudice
6400639 collective discernment over issues of justice including the role of women in the church
6400640 but can we at least invite women in and just listen can we shut up long enough to hear their stories their experiences of being marginalized in the church can we hear the pain they feel

6400655 as the commander of that operation he should have known that such utterances by these refugees would intoxicate the soldiers who were there at the time to later turn around and harm the priests
6400656 how would i sense that a soldier who was not even there at the time i dropped them off would eventually turn and kill them long after i had left
6400657 genuinely concerned about the economy and how household wealth was now going backwards after tripling under the howard government
6400658 i am genuinely concerned i think australians are beginning to feel genuinely concerned that less than 12 months after the last election they are going backwards in net terms he said
6400659 well i obviously am representing my constituents and they are concerned he said
6400660 im not a big name like jeff gordon and dale earnhardt jr im not flashy thats good im happy where we are

6400664 coach k established certain parameters for the players to follow to be on the team

6400666 i think every single person in this country needs to be looking at better ways to live their life every day whether its recycling or driving less or whatever it is
6400667 we nascar need to be doing the same thing we are leaders in the automotive industry in a utopian society these cars would be as green as possible but the only way to get there is to try to get there

6400671 act setting up the national film and video censors board makes it a criminal offence to distribute exhibit warehouse or engage in transactions on films and video works without a license from the board
6400672 over the past 26 months the board has engaged all levels of stakeholders in fashioning out the framework for licensing of distributors and exhibitors and last month that process was completed and perfected
6400673 yes indeed the board in a joint exercise with the security agencies and the judiciary has empaneled task forces to identify and apprehend all those doing business illegally in film and video works across the country
6400674 like i have mentioned the board is working with all relevant agencies of the law enforcement and crime deterrent agencies to stamp out dubious and shadowy characters who are suspected to have illegally flooded the nigerian markets with pirated foreign movies
6400675 that those who have so far been arrested are prime suspects in the criminal practices i have identified above these no doubt are clear economic crimes that costs nigeria about 1 billion annually in revenues from the film sector only no government will fold its hands and watch such grave pillage of national resource unchallenged
6400676 there is a big motorcade in the town square of falmouth that has been going on for more than two hours
6400677 the town square was blocked for more than an hour before it cleared a bit but the celebrations are continuing

6400679 there will be a massive street dance in his home community of sherwood content later tonight
6400680 we are also getting a committee together to plan a big home coming celebration for whenever usain decides to come home
6400681 i was so excited it was as if i had won the gold myself this is truly amazing
6400682 it was the kind of freak rain and hail storm we only get every 20 years we had about an inch and a half of rain come down in less than half an hour
6400683 there was development happening on the creek bed but the landslide washed away part of the development there were no injuries
6400684 the scam involves a person or persons entering a businesses and stealing the businesss debit pin pad and replacing it with a dummy pin pad that records the users card and pin number information they can then return and switch the pin pads again taking the dummy pin pad and its collected information they then use this information to make new debit cards to access your account make purchases and steal your money
6400685 some of these bogus pads are blue tooth enabled which allows the suspects to transmit the information to someone who might be sitting in a car in the parking lot with a laptop
6400686 if they have wireless technology they will transmit it immediately to someone who is fraudulently creating cards
6400687 some of the very large boats are so bad if you are sitting on your balcony or patio and they go by on the other side of the lake youll have to stop your conversation because you cant hear its that loud
6400688 its an issue for a huge number of people the website basically says we are asking the fine be drastically increased and at a second offence the boat be impounded and not allowed back in the water until the exhaust is permanently fixed
6400689 as i understand it it only adds about a 5 increase so if people werent allowed to do it it isnt going to have any appreciable effect on the enjoyment of the boat
6400690 the fine is just 115 a lot of those boats spend that much on gas in an hour so its not a significant fine as far they are concerned the rcmp do their best but they dont have the resources to enforce properly
6400691 we also have to realize that these things have been sitting in the water for the past 50 years so its not like were introducing them to a foreign body
6400692 the prime concern would appear to be a little bit of turbidity as they land on the bottom of the lake i suspect that we do far more damage to okanagan lake with our milfoil program than will be done by these pontoons
6400693 his injuries were the result of a lightning strike that hit the ground and travelled to where the worker was standing he was taken to kgh
6400694 i want to encourage people in this community who may not normally think that they have the time to run for council to reconsider
6400695 i think its important that we have people from all walks of life and that includes people who have businesses who are busy and think they are too busy for council we have people sitting at this table who have jobs who run multiple businesses and still have time to make a contribution to their community
6400696 my greatest concern is we have a good representation of our community and not just people who are looking for jobs if you need a job and you cant find one then this isnt what you should be doing
6400697 anybody running for council has to understand that youre an independent person and you stand up and make all kinds of promises and criticisms of the current council and how much better you would do let me tell you its not as easy as you think it is
6400698 ive listened especially in the last week to a lot of innuendo about this council a lot of mean spirited nasty things have been said in the last week and it bothers me because there isnt one person sitting around this council table that is mean spirited that doesnt care deeply about this community and doesnt think long and hard about the decision that get made
6400699 to the people that ive served with here for three years and we sure dont always agree i have enjoyed working with each and every one of you and disagreeing with each and every one of you
6400700 the laurel packinghouse is an important asset for this city but it is now showing its age
6400701 we are taking the necessary steps to understand exactly which repairs are needed so that the building can be enjoyed for many years to come
6400702 in addition the mechanical electrical and sprinkler systems are nearing the end of their service life the building also needs upgrades to meet current codes for accessibility
6400703 the building has stood for nearly a century and has been well used by the community since the second floor was added 25 years ago we encourage the public to continue to visit the museums
6400704 i think the decision to appeal is shameful to say the least its a complete waste of taxpayers money
6400705 this document is a trust for the benefit of the citizens that this land is to be held not sold in perpetuity for the benefit of citizens and is to be used for municipal purposes so why would the citizens elected officials go to court to have that struck down its just bizarre i dont understand the decision making process at city hall that would do that when i believe the vast majority of citizens simply would like it to be left alone yet the elected officials will not leave it alone
6400706 so far there is currently no convincing evidence from animal or human studies that the energy from cell phones is enough to cause serious health effects such as cancer epileptic seizures or sleep disorders
6400707 the new guidelines were issued by the american academy of pediatrics and the push to aggressively screen and medicate for high cholesterol in children is certain to create controversy amid a continuing debate about the use of prescription drugs in children as well as the best approaches to ward off heart disease in adults
6400708 since the moment i set foot on this site i was inspired to create a place where the full resort get away experience could be enjoyed by owners and vacationers and we are thrilled that bellstar has come on board to help us create and implement such a program
6400709 the fact that bellstar is also providing technical and planning expertise operations management and their reservations system adds greater value to the resort
6400710 but we are trying to understand the label on a juice bar
6400711 it is one of those ideas that makes you wonder why didnt someone think of this before
6400712 i had an episode with summit energy they contacted me the day after my husband died and talked to my son he told them they should talk to me because their offer sounded good they never did and i never signed anything nor did anyone else but they told terasen that i was their customer and it took endless calls and several months of higher bills and an ultimate complaint laid by me with the utilities commission before summit let me out from under what they called compassionate grounds this was without a signed contract my advice is dont even talk to these people

6400741 i left a very special situation at marquette when indiana offered me this opportunity
6400742 i wanted to make sure that if i left i would be going to a place that would be a destination for my family and allow me to build a program for the long haul with the same security
6400743 i appreciate the confidence that president mcrobbie and the university have shown in me by offering the two additional years to the agreement
6400744 it is a great responsibility to lead this program and i look forward to the challenge of bringing the program the respect it deserves the process of restoring this great program is going to take a lot of time more than probably any of us anticipated

6400755 since inception this project has been in the hands of the regional district even before the district of westside was incorporated it doesnt appear to me the district of westside has been in control of this situation from the beginning
6400756 it is starting to unravel prices have gone up and the building size has gone down
6400757 certainly the regional district is handling this project at the pleasure of the westside and if the westside chose to take over management of this project the regional district would understand that decision to do so
6400758 council has indicated to us a go ahead from a financing point of view
6400759 fall construction is the anticipated date for the west harbour development that will be the first mega sized project that will go ahead

6400764 for the conflicts in the region easbrig is the solution
6400765 our mission will be specialised in peace and security matters
6400766 i have no doubt that the recommendations that are to come from your deliberations will provide very significant inputs to the subsequent easbrig meetings
6400767 i believe that a shared view of the standards we are striving to achieve will assist us in our continued efforts to prepare and develop easbricom towards the realisation of its objectives
6400768 there is a rule in this city dogs have to be kept on the leash if you dont follow the rules you will be fined 60

6400777 what is important is capacity building for example you cant know how to use money when no one advised you on this
6400778 there is nothing i can say to defend myself since i asked for the dossier several times and could not get it
6400779 what evidence shows that you came to court and i refused to give you the dossier
6400780 who said it was in the presidents office and therefore you could not access it it was your right to come and pick it anytime and even if your lawyer had come we would have given it to him i dont agree with that you are lying to the court
6400781 it is unprecedented to retry a case that was disposed of before any verdict has been pronounced this is undermining justice and an attempt to rewrite law books
6400782 fellow countrymen with deep sorrow and immense grief i would like to inform the people of zambia that our president dr levy patrick mwanawasa died this morning
6400783 zambians will remember him for standing up to his predecessor frederick chiluba he proved he was no puppet despite being mr chilubas chosen successor and within months of taking office in 2002 he had stripped the former president of his immunity from prosecution for corruption
6400784 sadc cannot stand by and do nothing when one of its members is experiencing political and economic pain

6400787 there is a general decline in the number of accidents in spite of the few isolated cases of fatal accidents here and there

6400793 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6400794 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6400795 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6400796 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6400797 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6400798 we are very fortunate to sign a player of theos caliber
6400799 he is a consummate professional who will provide us with additional depth in the front court
6400800 we have lined up a series of activities including a regatta with 200 rowers out to rescue our symbol of integrity
6400801 there will be a litany of untruths from 12 00 midnight as concerned artists will make an image of judas stuffed with firecrackers to cap the event
6400802 from the babaylan to our muslim brothers and other faiths
6400803 there will be a lugawan where people from all walks of like will be treated to traditional evening snacks

6400805 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6400806 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6400807 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6400808 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6400809 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6400810 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6400811 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6400812 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6400813 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6400814 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6400815 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6400816 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6400817 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6400818 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6400819 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6400820 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6400821 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6400822 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6400823 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6400824 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6400825 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6400826 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6400827 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6400828 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6400829 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6400830 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6400831 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6400832 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6400833 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6400834 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6400835 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6400836 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6400837 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6400838 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6400839 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6400840 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6400841 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6400842 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6400843 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6400844 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6400845 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6400846 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6400847 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6400848 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6400849 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6400850 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6400851 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6400852 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6400853 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6400854 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6400855 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6400856 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6400857 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6400858 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6400859 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6400860 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6400861 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6400862 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6400863 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6400864 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6400865 now this is my kind of diet and it worked
6400866 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6400867 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6400868 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6400869 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6400870 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6400871 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6400872 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6400873 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6400874 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6400875 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6400876 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6400877 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6400878 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6400879 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6400880 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6400881 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6400882 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6400883 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6400884 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6400885 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6400886 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6400887 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6400888 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6400889 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6400890 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6400891 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6400892 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6400893 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6400894 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6400895 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6400896 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6400897 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6400898 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6400899 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6400900 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6400901 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6400902 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6400903 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6400904 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6400905 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6400906 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6400907 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6400908 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6400909 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6400910 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6400911 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6400912 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
6400913 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
6400914 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
6400915 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
6400916 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
6400917 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
6400918 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
6400919 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6400920 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6400921 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6400922 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6400923 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6400924 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6400925 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6400926 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6400927 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6400928 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6400929 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6400930 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6400931 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6400932 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6400933 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6400934 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6400935 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6400936 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6400937 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6400938 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6400939 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6400940 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6400941 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6400942 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
6400943 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
6400944 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
6400945 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
6400946 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
6400947 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6400948 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6400949 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6400950 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6400951 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6400952 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6400953 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6400954 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6400955 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6400956 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6400957 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6400958 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6400959 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6400960 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6400961 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6400962 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6400963 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6400964 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6400965 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6400966 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6400967 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6400968 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6400969 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6400970 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6400971 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6400972 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6400973 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6400974 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6400975 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6400976 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6400977 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6400978 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6400979 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6400980 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6400981 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6400982 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6400983 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6400984 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6400985 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6400986 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6400987 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6400988 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6400989 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6400990 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6400991 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6400992 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6400993 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6400994 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6400995 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6400996 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6400997 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6400998 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6400999 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6401000 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6401001 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6401002 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6401003 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6401004 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6401005 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6401006 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6401007 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6401008 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6401009 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6401010 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6401011 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6401012 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6401013 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6401014 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6401015 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6401016 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6401017 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6401018 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6401019 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6401020 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6401021 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6401022 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6401023 mancillar a el esp ritu del d a nacional de la independencia
6401024 no es el momento no va de acuerdo con el buen esp ritu del d a nacional de la independencia si sigui ramos adelante con el concierto estar amos haciendo lo contrario a lo que deseamos para esta fiesta
6401025 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6401026 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6401027 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6401028 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6401029 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6401030 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6401031 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6401032 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6401033 thats a secret pleasure for me i dont even know exactly why i like it so much except that is has dench and she could gargle and id love it
6401034 my foodie friends would not be pleased but whenever i need a little lift maybe every three months or so i eat an entire tub of frozen cool whip its soothing its cold and i love it
6401035 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6401036 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6401037 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6401038 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6401039 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6401040 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6401041 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6401042 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6401043 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6401044 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6401045 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6401046 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6401047 welcome to mccainpalin com the best source for information on the john mccain sarah palin 2008 republican presidential ticket stayed sic tuned for important announcements
6401048 the governor will play some kind of unspecified role in the convention
6401049 but the only contact with the mccain campaign has been a request for her to participate in a national call on energy issues there has been no outreach or vetting regarding the vice presidency
6401050 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6401051 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6401052 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6401053 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6401054 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6401055 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6401056 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6401057 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6401058 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6401059 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6401060 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6401061 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6401062 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play
6401063 captures the guitarists as each explains and demonstrates how he changed the sound of the electric guitar to suit his own distinctive musical style
6401064 more investment and infrastructure development in the country access to one network zains roaming charge free service in numerous countries in africa and the middle east improvement in quality of service qos greater synergy in terms of products and services developments and sharing of expertise and experience
6401065 aggressive rural expansion and connection programme through the introduction of the most cost effective ultra low cost gsm handsets and rural distribution and entrepreneurship programme the rural acquisition initiative rai that seeks to create wealth and jobs and involve communities in the maintenance security of base stations and distribution of products
6401066 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6401067 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6401068 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6401069 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6401070 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6401071 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6401072 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6401073 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6401074 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6401075 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6401076 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6401077 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6401078 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6401079 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6401080 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6401081 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6401082 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6401083 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6401084 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6401085 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6401086 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6401087 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6401088 the roman catholic church which was supposed to carry the light of the gospel plunged the world into the dark ages
6401089 john paul ii will be remembered for staring down communism and embracing people of all faiths and colors
6401090 that blowhard needs to close his yap or lose his job
6401091 encourage their daughters to delay serious relationships and go out in groups figuring it would delay physical intimacy as well they couldnt have been said stepp in an interview earlier this year more wrong
6401092 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6401093 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6401094 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6401095 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6401096 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6401097 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6401098 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6401099 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6401100 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6401101 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6401102 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6401103 the nespresso le cube has a strong attitude its a trendsetter
6401104 the new models black and bronze patina are reflecting the continuous trend of the international design world towards sleek sober and pure designs reduced to the essentials
6401105 by swearing in gods homes that i was sodomised by my employer i challenge anwar ibrahim to swear and to do it in a mosque to deny my allegations
6401106 we see no reason why they should proceed with the case
6401107 i advise those around him to leave the sinking ship of his leadership while there is still a chance to do so
6401108 he caught me he kicked me straight in my head
6401109 with carlos you expect that you know what hes dirty i wish i could say otherwise but i played in mls and ive seen it there is no place for it its reckless its there for everyone to see but again i kind of expect it
6401110 i think you would rather have him come and man up and say look i dont like you im going to kick you and im going to do all that
6401111 you can almost respect it in a funny way but he has this way about him where he kicks and punches hes an asshole and he wants to come and be your friend theres just no place for it
6401112 coach what do you think of a big team like the united states needing the referee to help it win a game against guatemala
6401113 what did you think of guatemalas red card which was obviously a make up call for the usa red card
6401114 well if cabrera did that in the united states hed probably get arrested here theyll probably give him a medal
6401115 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6401116 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6401117 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6401118 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6401119 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6401120 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6401121 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6401122 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6401123 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6401124 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6401125 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6401126 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6401127 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6401128 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6401129 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6401130 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6401131 im opposed to commitments for three years much less 40 thats irresponsible in my opinion
6401132 what commissioner privette is doing is not giving smi the respect to see the entire agreement instead of reading a part of the agreement in the paper
6401133 i question whether privettes true allegiance is with taxpayers or with himself
6401134 she wasnt in new york she wasnt in california she was right here in charlotte
6401135 her mother tried to get help for her social services is supposed to help you out when you have children and need help
6401136 whoever did help this suspect get on the bus didnt help anyone in any way shape or form
6401137 to think that that person knew what happened to that girl just 14 years old its just disgusting its reprehensible
6401138 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6401139 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6401140 as an appropriate and tactical option to bring the matter to a safe conclusion
6401141 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6401142 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6401143 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6401144 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6401145 when we organize ourselves as a region and we promote ourselves as a region were much more powerful
6401146 previous mayors have paid lip service to the notion of regionalism but its just never happened
6401147 the fact that mayor nutter made this an early priority and physically came out to the suburbs really spoke volumes
6401148 there are a lot of structural reasons for that animosity
6401149 the city and suburbs have competed for jobs residents for attention which often results in tensions
6401150 it was done in a way that tore at the fabric of regional cooperation
6401151 the county got bigfooted frankly by the arts world in the city and by the political leadership there in a way thats not particularly helpful
6401152 the fact that so many different organizations have to approve everything we work on that can be difficult because it can take a long time
6401153 what this usually requires is a central city mayor like richard daley in chicago to share the credit and work collaborative allow sometimes the suburban counterparts to take the lead on an initiative so that they have the buy in thats needed
6401154 when mayor daley goes to the caucus he goes in like any other mayor he sits in the back of the room and when he has a question he raises his hand i would expect to do the same thing
6401155 i just want to play an appropriate role in getting it started
6401156 i dont think this investigation would ever have started without christian marrone
6401157 prior to the federal governments involvement i think he provided information that found its way to the inquirer that produced a multitude of stories that i think got the attention of the federal authorities i do believe without christians involvement in providing that information it would never have gotten to where it is today
6401158 i dont see any purpose in talking about the trial or vince at this point
6401159 totally baseless and ridiculous its completely desperate and runs counter to the facts at hand facts are stubborn things and the truth will come out
6401160 and i want them to know while they may not have always come first because of my public service for the rest of my life they will always come first
6401161 but it was evident when marrone worked for us that he absolutely hated senator fumo he was constantly bashing the senator
6401162 well make believe well play sambas in our hotel room
6401163 certainly he was quite serious with his efforts to engage in sex acts with a minor
6401164 im not a collector i want the real taste let me call you
6401165 i want to hear your girlish voice telling me what to do
6401166 we took a lot of bad people off the streets today
6401167 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6401168 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6401169 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6401170 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6401171 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6401172 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6401173 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6401174 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6401175 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6401176 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6401177 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6401178 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6401179 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6401180 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6401181 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6401182 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6401183 if i cant trust him rely on him after six solid months of training bonding and effort on my part then why am i going through all this exertion
6401184 be joyful in hope patient in affliction faithful in prayer
6401185 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6401186 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6401187 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6401188 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6401189 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6401190 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6401191 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6401192 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6401193 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6401194 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6401195 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6401196 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6401197 we are pleased to welcome sigve brekke on board as our chairman and look forward to benefiting from his strategic competence and operational knowledge i would also like to take this opportunity to thank arve johansen for his instrumental role in digis growth and significant contributions over the years
6401198 since i first came to digi and malaysia in 1999 i have taken great interest in following the outstanding development of the company i now look forward to participating actively in the new phases that both digi and the malaysian mobile and broadband market will face
6401199 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6401200 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6401201 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6401202 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6401203 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6401204 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6401205 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6401206 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6401207 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6401208 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6401209 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6401210 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6401211 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6401212 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6401213 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon

6401215 no he starts in fantasy and ends up in chaos
6401216 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6401217 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6401218 im opposed to commitments for three years much less 40 thats irresponsible in my opinion
6401219 what commissioner privette is doing is not giving smi the respect to see the entire agreement instead of reading a part of the agreement in the paper
6401220 i question whether privettes true allegiance is with taxpayers or with himself
6401221 this is a very big moment in our history too
6401222 the minimum being suspension for the remainder of the season for those involved including our two nationwide series crew chiefs
6401223 there will also be an additional monetary fine beyond the amount announced by nascar which will be the responsibility of those involved
6401224 as they had no knowledge or involvement of this incident
6401225 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 percent of the blame rests with us
6401226 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6401227 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable
6401228 because of poor decision making i have failed as the leader of this team and i am solely responsible for this situation
6401229 i apologize to the men and women of nascar for my dishonesty and interference during a testing event
6401230 trust me to lead this race team with honesty and integrity i have failed them and feel great remorse for doing so
6401231 it is nascars responsibility to ensure that the competitive playing field is level for everyone
6401232 in this case the rule violation was serious and was attempting to interfere with our ability to conduct an accurate postrace competitive analysis it called for a serious reaction on our part and we think the penalty speaks to that

6401234 until we look at each individual case and dig into the narratives to see why tasers were used we are not going to be able to tell
6401235 it would be great if they would comply and stand still and look at you as you sprayed them but thats not the way it usually goes down
6401236 pepper still has its uses but in a lot of ways tasers are just better
6401237 every time i used pepper spray i still had to fight the person
6401238 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6401239 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6401240 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6401241 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6401242 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6401243 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6401244 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6401245 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6401246 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6401247 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6401248 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6401249 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6401250 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6401251 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6401252 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6401253 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6401254 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6401255 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6401256 may they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me
6401257 pastor the church is just not in favor of this
6401258 not everyone holds the same conviction about these things for the sake of unity we need a statement of beliefs we can all adhere to
6401259 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6401260 they told me there are going to be resources here
6401261 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6401262 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6401263 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6401264 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6401265 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6401266 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6401267 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6401268 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6401269 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6401270 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6401271 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6401272 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6401273 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6401274 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning

6401281 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6401282 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6401283 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6401284 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6401285 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss

6401307 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6401308 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

6401310 world music to me is music from different parts of the world that isnt normally heard its a nebulous term people should make their own definition
6401311 when we started our demographic may have skewed older but with the introduction of our groove and lounge series were naturally attracting a younger audience
6401312 a lot of scenes like indie rock punk and electronica are marginalized and consist of people whose tastes arent dictated by mainstream tastes
6401313 were getting more and more interest from hip hop djs who feel the international flavor of the music naturally fits into their sets it doesnt matter what youre into if the musics good
6401314 with the internet there are just more outlets to be exposed to good music whether its from greece iran egypt tahiti or thailand its all more readily available on line
6401315 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6401316 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6401317 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6401318 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6401319 i really want to focus on some of our local or state stories
6401320 for instance not only is nevada a swing state my county is considered the swing county in the state also we have the possibility of electing our first all female congressional delegation which is really exciting
6401321 scientists and economists have been offered 10 000 each by a lobby group funded by one of the worlds largest oil companies to undermine a major climate change report due to be published today letters sent by the american enterprise institute aei an exxonmobil funded thinktank with close links to the bush administration offered the payments for articles that emphasise the shortcomings of a report from the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc travel expenses and additional payments were also offered climate scientists described the move yesterday as an attempt to cast doubt over the overwhelming scientific evidenceon global warming its a desperate attempt by an organisation who wants to distort science for their own political aims said david viner of the climatic research unit at the university of east anglia on monday another exxon funded organisation based in canada will launch a review in london which casts doubt on the ipcc report

6401324 washingtonthe bush administration is clamping down on scientists at the us geological survey the latest agency subjected to controls on research that might go against official policy new rules require screening of all facts and interpretations by agency scientists who study everything from caribou mating to global warming the rules apply to all scientific papers and other public documents even minor reports or prepared talks according to documents obtained by the associated press
6401325 newly uncovered documents show discrepencies between what managers told two different federal agencies before and after firing an employee who raised safety concerns at fitzpatrick nuclear plant nearly three years after entergy corporation dismissed engineer carl patrickson from his position at its fitzpatrick nuclear power plant near oswego critics also say the company and federal regulators have failed to adequately address the chilled work atmosphere that resulted according to transcripts of interviews conducted by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc and the department of labor and reviewed by the newstandard three fitzpatrick managers gave conflicting testimony to the federal agencies about whether they knew patrickson had reported safety problems before he was fired can wants the nrc to suspend the three entergy managers who apparently gave false testimony in the case as well as reinstate patricksons job patrickson described in court testimony a long of period of worker intimidation for reporting possible safety hazards and violations
6401326 we found out that there were workers who perceived that they would be treated negatively by management for raising issues and consequently some of the workers expressed reluctance to raise issues under certain circumstances
6401327 we refer to it as a chilling effect a situation when workers do not feel comfortable raising safety concerns
6401328 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6401329 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6401330 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful

6401333 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6401334 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6401335 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6401336 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

6401341 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6401342 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6401343 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6401344 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming

6401350 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6401351 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6401352 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6401353 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

6401357 too bad about the ratings but hes the most recognizable athlete in the world
6401358 if you cant swing a club until after the first of the year i dont know how he makes that one
6401359 the sport has to be ready to accept a different tiger
6401360 to prolong his career he may have to make some concessions he may have to alter his swing somewhat hes going to have to adapt significantly to his situation if he doesnt his career is going to be short lived
6401361 swing after swing his body has to withstand that one then the next one then the next tournament and the tournament after that
6401362 his knee is a lot older than he is theres very little reserve in that knee
6401363 after what he did at the u s open theyre scratching their heads in wonderment
6401364 having known him nearly 20 years he continues to ask more of himself
6401365 his wrist hurt so badly he shouldnt have played hes really worked hard and changed his body this year he worked out got stronger and hes just now starting to play well in his new body
6401366 i think hes going to be better than hes ever been
6401367 hes not going to be over this injury for another year after he comes back
6401368 theres no way to short cut it its just a long recovery
6401369 it doesnt matter if youre superhuman it doesnt change the fact
6401370 my expectation is that tiger will come back better than when he left
6401371 i know tiger woods i know how determined he is
6401372 its not a real bold prediction when i say hes going to be better when he won the u s open on one leg i mean its not like im going out on a limb or anything hell come back dont worry

6401379 hes gotten bigger and stronger and his velocity has increased dramatically in the last five or sixth months neverett said
6401380 and i think what a lot of coaches like is his ability to throw three pitches for strikes
6401381 in terms of polish i think hes ahead of the curve for a pitcher just going into his senior year im thrilled for him because i know how hard hes worked
6401382 i think he saw me pitch four or five times feehan said
6401383 they want he to get bigger and stronger to maintain the velocity on my fastball
6401384 i see him as a very successful starting pitcher once he gets down there they are just converting to a division i school and wont be eligible for the ncaa regionals for the next three years
6401385 i think he saw me pitch four or five times feehan said
6401386 they want he to get bigger and stronger to maintain the velocity on my fastball

6401388 weve got to get better because you never stay the same you get better or worse

6401390 hes doing great wouldnt you 60 million richer hes doing wonderful
6401391 i think weve been on our heels definitely these last two preseason games
6401392 not from the scoreboard but just from the play within the games were behind and we need to pick it up
6401393 it looked like a completely different team out there against tampa bay and how they were ready and we werent they treated it like a game and we went out there treating it as a scrimmage
6401394 so we cant do anything about that we have to get better as a team without him
6401395 im not saying i went out there and every run was the best i ran hard and did the best with the carries i had but i still have room to get better
6401396 its a good time for the team to really jell together because after the third one its two more weeks and youre playing for real

6401467 the mechanic suffered an electric shock after touching the sidepod and steering wheel of the car there was a high frequency ac voltage between these contact points the cause of which has been traced back to the kers control unit and a sporadic capacitive coupling from the high voltage network to the 12 volt network the voltage ran through the wiring of the 12 volt network to the steering wheel and through the carbon chassis back to the control unit
6401468 no as only a small amount of energy can be transferred through this capacitive coupling effect however the energy is sufficient to cause an extremely painful reaction the driver was insulated against the car by his racing overalls and gloves and therefore not in any danger
6401469 it was not possible initially to reproduce the capacitive coupling effect in the car as the problem was caused by a sporadic error in the control unit due to the extremely high frequency of the voltage in the steering wheel the safety mechanisms and data recordings did not pick up on the error in the absence of data all the theoretical possibilities had to be systematically investigated and analysed in tests furthermore the capacitive coupling effect only occurs under certain conditions without the option of driving the kers test car used in jerez again we had to reconstruct these conditions we also had to develop a model to be installed between the steering wheel and sidepod which replicated the characteristics of the human body as an electric transfer element
6401470 in addition to the measures required to tackle the issue at hand the extremely far reaching analysis we conducted also gave rise to other recommendations which are of great value for the development of electric kers systems among the measures arrived at are changes in the design of the control unit to avoid capacitive coupling effects extended monitoring functions for high frequencies and a conductive connection of the chassis components to avoid any electric potential
6401471 we have already handed over this safety analysis complete with measures and recommendations to the fia and will also make our findings available to the other teams at the next meeting of the technical working group

6401655 the scheme ran the risk of becoming a poverty trap because most of those on it would lose their benefit if they went back to work
6401656 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6401657 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
6401658 this would appear to be true even if the obesity results from binge eating as this disorder is characterized by eating patterns that are similar to drug taking patterns in those with cocaine dependency

6401665 senator obama says he wants energy independence but hes opposed to do drilling at home
6401666 he points down at his feet and i dont know if he knows something i dont
6401667 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient
6401668 by understanding how calcium is detected in the mouth we can either make it easier to consume by reducing its bad taste or even make pharmacological agents that make it taste better

6401682 this is an issue of having community leaders come to an agreement

6401694 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
6401695 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive

6401708 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6401709 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment ldl cholesterol
6401710 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6401711 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher ldl levels
6401712 this is especially true of cancers involving the blood cell system but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6401713 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers
6401714 we need to do a much better job of keeping track of these relationships
6401715 in major trials of statins some do not even report on the number of cancers we need a lot more research in this area in terms of biology virtually nothing is known
6401716 what we need is patient level data to see whether a pattern emerges of different risks at different ldl levels
6401717 but when we give medications to millions we need information about risks versus benefits
6401718 there are some question marks and they may change the risk benefit ratio for some patients
6401719 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
6401720 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad alcohol dependence in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
6401721 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
6401722 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
6401723 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
6401724 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible alcohol abuse or dependence
6401725 problems with the use of sizing of graduated compression stockings are common throughout the country and this study is one of the first to systematically analyze the problems and recommend ways to improve practice
6401726 based on the study findings we recommend that knee length stockings be the standard length used and that the education of nurses and patients about the proper use of stockings be improved
6401727 for this generation of teenagers were not going to have data for the next 15 or 20 years on how effective it a cervical cancer vaccine is what it changes about the dynamics of cervical cancer how long the vaccine lasts whether you can then extrapolate this to decreasing screening guidelines
6401728 we need more long term data from this generation of girls getting vaccinates now to make decisions on a population basis
6401729 our main findings were that preadolescent vaccinating targeting 12 year old girls is fairly attractive
6401730 we found consistently that catch up vaccination up to the age of 18 was cost effective that extending catch up vaccinations in women to the age of 21 was cost effective when we made very generous assumptions about vaccines properties and that generally speaking the catch up up to age 26 was not cost effective
6401731 theres a lot of uncertainty in the data and we had to make a lot of assumptions about the vaccines properties
6401732 we made very optimistic assumptions and we havent looked at the vaccine long enough to know how these assumptions will bear out
6401733 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods
6401734 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain the body
6401735 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6401736 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity
6401737 if you have had preeclampsia you should be aware that you are at increased risk for renal and cardiovascular disease and you should try to reduce that risk
6401738 historically the thought was that after delivery everything was fine but preeclampsia isnt benign and it may initiate a cascade of damage that takes years to develop into clinically relevant renal disease
6401739 the take home message from this study is that any young woman who has had any variant of preeclampsia and eclampsia needs to be monitored for ongoing or recurrent kidney disease high blood pressure and diabetes
6401740 indeed the likelihood that chronic renal failure did not develop even among women with three previous episodes of preeclampsia was greater than 99 percent
6401741 its critical that doctors and patients understand that there is now a linkage between preeclampsia and esrd for women whove had preeclampsia this is a reason to increase your sensitivity to healthy living and not add to your risk keep your weight down avoid smoking and avoid drinking too much also check for diabetes and blood pressure at least once a year
6401742 we found that the odor profile coming from the skin of skin cancer patients was markedly different than that coming from healthy skin
6401743 so we think that this kind of biomarker could be used in a rapid and noninvasive way to detect skin cancer
6401744 and this would be novel because now the only way to do so is with a visual exam and a biopsy which is of course invasive
6401745 but i think within a few years its reasonable to say that this could end up being a diagnostic tool that would be a routine thing one could do in a doctors office its a real possibility
6401746 in terms of this replacing the standard method we have of diagnosing skin cancer which is basically to look at a specimen under the microscope its hard to imagine this would do it completely
6401747 because when youre dealing with cancer the margin for error is really small you dont want to miss something that may be a cancer that then doesnt get treated and you dont want to treat someone for cancer if they actually have something else so its really a very novel and interesting idea but one which i think really needs to be further researched and carefully confirmed

6401770 we would like to see it in a prominent position at the millennium stadium personally i would prefer for it to be on the walkway leading up to the stadium but obviously there has to be other considerations like planning permission
6401771 but there are so many visitors there who would have a chance to know all about sir tasker
6401772 the first minister has agreed to provide welsh assembly government funding towards erecting a statue in honour of the late sir tasker watkins
6401773 we considered it appropriate for cardiff as the capital city for wales to play its part alongside the wru the welsh assembly government and others to honour a lifetime of achievement with the dedication of a statue to a remarkable welshman and freeman of the city
6401774 the council has earmarked up to 25 000 for this purpose

6401780 professional sports stadiums are another place where theres a great likelihood of illegal alcohol sales
6401781 we know that we have problems with fans drinking too much and contributing to problems in and around stadiums we need to make sure we prevent these illegal sales from occurring
6401782 i would imagine these vendors are under quite a bit of pressure trying to not block the views of others trying to pay attention
6401783 they dont have the time or proximity to buyers to make observations necessary to avoid making an illegal sale
6401784 you just have to attend a sports event to see that some fans drink too much and spoil the event for others through loud disruptive and drunken behavior
6401785 limiting serving to the booths could make drinkers walk and stand on line between drinks cutting down the number they consume
6401786 these allegations be they true or false this one included theyre all turning points to a more open sumo

6401829 people your customers many of whom dont give you a dime are offering to sign up for your paid service if you just do this why dont you
6401830 my baby never been in trouble let alone part of something like this my baby wasnt even allowed to play with toy guns everyone is saying theyre shocked im just as shocked as everyone else
6401831 he dont even know where the gun shop is at
6401832 these guys totally took my baby out of the neighborhood for people to keep passing judgment they dont even know him
6401833 he wanted to be president and he wanted to be a basketball player
6401834 he said he dont ever want no friends again ever
6401835 he doesnt even want to go outside they had to manipulate him he is only 11 hes a sweet boy
6401836 it had to be because aint no way in the world theyre going to go through something like that on their own
6401837 i dont think this investigation would ever have started without christian marrone
6401838 prior to the federal governments involvement i think he provided information that found its way to the inquirer that produced a multitude of stories that i think got the attention of the federal authorities i do believe without christians involvement in providing that information it would never have gotten to where it is today
6401839 i dont see any purpose in talking about the trial or vince at this point
6401840 totally baseless and ridiculous its completely desperate and runs counter to the facts at hand facts are stubborn things and the truth will come out
6401841 and i want them to know while they may not have always come first because of my public service for the rest of my life they will always come first
6401842 but it was evident when marrone worked for us that he absolutely hated senator fumo he was constantly bashing the senator
6401843 its a massive challenge we havent beaten them for a fair while
6401844 were going to try and pick a team that is confident and is young and that can run and give us a chance to win
6401845 we are bringing a couple of young blokes back to give them a really good experience against a really good team
6401846 collingwood have got a few young guys in as well so i think it will be a snapshot of the future
6401847 it will probably give you a bit of a feel for both teams and their younger players and how both teams are going to look three or four years from now
6401848 the way the game has opened up a bit with the rules and things like that i think every team is probably having a lot more trouble this year defending than in previous seasons
6401849 but certainly leo brings a lot of confidence back he is a very good player
6401850 it would be silly to do the same thing over and over again and get the same result we have to do things differently which we will
6401851 this is a lot different market to melbourne weve got pressure on us to be competitive every single year and we understand that
6401852 we will make some changes at the end of the season but they wont be as dramatic as what probably people think they should be
6401853 he is a bloke who is influential he is a bloke who is inspirational because he does intimidate and blokes alongside him tend to respond to that
6401854 it is good to have him back but most importantly it is good for him
6401855 he didnt enjoy watching the last outing and hopefully he brings that grumpiness with him
6401856 you dont need to read too much into that because the volume of game time wont change just the order
6401857 it is not a reflection of ranking so to speak it is the order we are using this week we will be looking to matty to put the after burners on and well respond to what we see
6401858 it is going to be dry it is going to be fast so that order serves
6401859 we have got versatility in the mix and in terms of covering full back ryan cross will do that
6401860 he has background in that position and he has done well with each opportunity he has got
6401861 at times there it was obvious we took the wrong option
6401862 a couple of times it was on and we just didnt pull it off so skill execution and wrong options a couple of times there were off but the thing is were having a go its just when to take them weve just got to be a bit more clinical when we do do it
6401863 i could be going tomorrow imagine if i get really booed
6401864 its very upsetting for us because we cant accommodate these people
6401865 so its just really sickening and theres very little we can do with it except try to have people deal with legitimate ticket agents
6401866 we work all year round hand in hand with the rest of the industry to combat these situations
6401867 we cannot possibly prevent individuals visiting and purchasing from sites like these that appear without warning and usually disappear without warning too
6401868 i just feel like a fool now when i was giving mine out i never thought that i was going to get them back i was just giving them because i was being nice

6401874 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun

6401900 i cannot see the harm in adding it as a way to counterbalance the conquistadors business leaders and war heroes that might otherwise take up the bulk of any american history class
6401901 a recent national assessment of education progress test found that more than half of high school seniors thought that germany italy or japan was our ally in world war ii
6401902 from each according to his ability to each according to his needs
6401903 never before in the history of our energy industry have we taken the bold steps that we are taking today

6401915 the calf was in much worse condition than they originally thought and the injuries were a lot worse than they thought as well probably from a shark attack
6401916 we have taken the hard decision to put it down unfortunately
6401917 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin

6401944 currently the final shape of the alliance is not known there is no laxman rekha to it as of now
6401945 yang perlu dikoordinasi bila ada narapidana narkoba dari luar negeri yang telah selesai masa hukumannya maka ia harus segera dideportasi ke negaranya kasus sindikat mr 20 ini contohnya ia sudah mendekam di penjara selama 4 5 tahun pada 2002 dan selesai 2006 tetapi tidak dideportasi maka ia masih beraktivitas di sini dan ditangkap lagi sekarang
6401946 ini untuk memberi efek jera dan melihat bahwa hukum di negara ini harus ditegakkan
6401947 nanti saya akan buat permintaan resmi ke imigrasi terkait hal ini karena kalau tidak dibatasi jaringan ini sudah melebar ke mana mana bahkan sudah ke lampung
6401948 sponsor itu juga perlu diteliti dengan cermat bila ada sponsor palsu segera ditindak sponsor yang membawahi sindikat yang tertangkap akan diperiksa juga apakah terkait dengan aktivitas mereka

6401962 as you get older the vaccine becomes less cost effective
6401963 there should be less of commissions and task forces but more work by the anti corruption agencies
6401964 these commissions are set up as a result of activism in parliament and pressure from the media parliamentary activism is simply power play
6401965 a strong inspector general would have done much better in the global fund case in which 148 million was misappropriated
6401966 in tanzania a strong prevention and combatting corruption bureau pccb would certainly do a better job than a task force
6401967 a political party will campaign using anti corruption rhetoric in order to stay in power or defeat their political opponents
6401968 illegal products are cheap but of poor quality which makes ignorant buyers discredit even the genuine brands

6401974 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss
6401975 i am going to miss her as a friend and colleague and her leadership will most certainly be missed by her constituents northeast ohio and the state as a whole
6401976 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6401977 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6401978 she was an effective legislator who was dedicated to helping small businesses improving local schools expanding job opportunities for ohioans and ensuring that more of them have access to health care
6401979 i wanted somebody whom i felt could carry on what i tried to do for 30 years in that congressional district
6401980 she did it she took it to a higher level a new level she made me so proud
6401981 the storm continues to be a threat to this community

6401984 they sent a warning to everyone not to leave their homes because the snakes are coming out of their holes and theres fish everywhere
6401985 despite the continued weakness in the economy and in the mens apparel business we saw an improvement in our sales performance trends this past quarter
6401986 although overall store traffic continues to be down our conversion rates and average sales transactions are up which indicate to us we are executing well in this difficult retail environment
6401987 if this country isnt doing well another is doing better so were very lucky we can do quite well
6401988 its mainly because of the acquisitions theyve made in the past and their geographical diversity so they are actually weathering the downturn quite well
6401989 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6401990 directed the authorities to make efforts to expose the hidden hands behind the incident
6401991 our bombers carried out todays attack it is in reaction to military operations in swat and bajaur
6401992 similar attacks will be carried out in other cities of pakistan including lahore islamabad and rawalpindi
6401993 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge
6401994 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside
6401995 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded
6401996 when i get to the racetrack i set up shop on my computer if theres work to be done if not any itunes store content that i purchased that past week will be synced to my apple tv on the bus so we can watch it throughout the race weekend when i come off the track
6401997 every tuesday i sit down with the pr staff and go through calendar commitments im sitting down with my computer and typically doing it all on a videoconference
6401998 everyone in my office is on a macbook pro and they all have the built in isight having that visual interface adds depth to the conversation
6401999 in the two places i live manhattan and charlotte i dont have at amp t phone service so i use my sprint phone for calls but im in love with the iphone itself
6402000 i love the fact that it doesnt have a hard keyboard and that the keyboard can come and go
6402001 they update my calendar back at the office and i sync in with my computer for my to do list email calendar everything the iphone contains pretty much everything i need to do in my life
6402002 sometimes i have to switch to the windows side of the machine for stuff like that
6402003 but like a lot of stuff now just about anything can run on apple hardware
6402004 i used to run and when i ran i had a nike ipod sport kit
6402005 i cant run anymore because of my knees so i ride my bike and use the iphone to listen to audiobooks i love audiobooks because they take you away from the moment even more so than music
6402006 ill tell you i once plugged my ipod into the audio system and listened to it during testing
6402007 but you cant listen to it in a race you have to be in constant communication with your spotter and your crew chief it just wouldnt make sense
6402008 well for one of the 500 mile races you would want something chill and laid back a kind of song maybe something by o a r or jack johnson for qualifying youd want something to get you fired up really hard for one single lap id say lose yourself by eminem
6402009 i love the simplicity the elegance the stability the easiness of it all when steve jobs and his team come out with a new product you think they cant do any better but then they come up with something else that knocks your socks off then theres the fact that they keep it secret up until they announce it im in an industry where thats very hard to do so im very impressed
6402010 im sure a lot of people would say theres no way that you can drive race cars for a living and be an environmentalist but i try to do what i can i take public transportation the subway i use energy efficient appliances i drive a toyota hybrid when im in charlotte and when im in new york i take the train
6402011 i want to voice support for russia over the situation around abkhazia and south ossetia we understand the essence of the russian position and consider its military reaction a response to provocation by the georgian side
6402012 i knew it was a fast track but i didnt think this was possible i am still shocked i have been aspiring to the world record for so long
6402013 i worked so hard to become champion and i will work harder to stay on top
6402014 by the end of 22 august all the forces of the russian federation will be behind the line of our zone of responsibility
6402015 norway notes that russia has decided that for now it is freezing all military co operation with nato and allied countries
6402016 we expect that this will not affect planned activities in the areas of coastguard operations search and rescue and resource management because on the russian side these are handled by civilian authorities
6402017 theres no doubt that our relationship to russia has now chilled
6402018 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
6402019 i went in there thinking nerd camp but it ended up being something completely different
6402020 i wanted to find something to do over the summer that was free and fun but educational at the same time
6402021 i wasnt expecting to get in the qualifications were wow and i had to write four essays and have teacher recommendations to be accepted
6402022 i dont think there was an area of physics that she didnt do well in
6402023 shes very driven and tries to stay involved in both school and extra activities
6402024 when they were driving us to cambridge from the airport i just looked around at everything and thought this is so surreal
6402025 the courses were really intense its not so much that the work was hard there was just so much
6402026 there was only one time that i was worried and that was when we were dealing with this mutant gene that they said if we got it on us something would grow on us
6402027 shes always been good with science and math my husband says she gets that from him

6402038 well i obviously am representing my constituents and they are concerned he said
6402039 it seems they are trying to roll some of the pieces of the technology from those companies into their base platform and in the process they are losing their identities
6402040 we talked to a number of customers and potential customers and they like the specific focus of turn
6402041 we and customers believe that turn has a very substantial technological advantage in its algorithm and engine to automate the process of behavioral targeting
6402042 there are a variety of exit options but given the history of this particular segment larger players have been very acquisitive as innovative startups build good technology
6402043 there have been something like eight ad network purchase for big prices over the past 18 months
6402044 the path to liquidity is slowed down but because we are later stage investors it creates more opportunities for us
6402045 companies that might have been acquired or gone public need to raise more capital
6402046 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6402047 these firms are licensed broker dealers and were obviously well paid by their clients for their specialized knowledge and diligence regarding the appropriateness of various products as investments

6402074 among the numerous stratagems by which pride endeavors to recommend folly to regard there is scarcely one that meets with less success than affectation or a perpetual disguise of the real character by fictitious appearances whether it be that every man hates falsehood from the natural congruity of truth to his faculties of reason or that every man is jealous of the honor of his understanding and thinks his discernment consequently called in question whenever any thing is exhibited under a borrowed form
6402075 there are men who always confound the praise of goodness with the practice and who believe themselves mild and moderate charitable and faithful because they have exerted their eloquence in commendation of mildness fidelity and other virtues this is an errour almost universal among those that converse much with dependants with such whose fear or interest disposes them to a seeming reverence for any declamation however enthusiastic and submission to any boast however arrogant having none to recall their attention to their lives they rate themselves by the goodness of their opinions and forget how much more easily men may shew their virtue in their talk than in their actions

6402333 it would seem to me that the republican party is not as far as i can tell and i have traveled to thousands of places last year a one issue party and that would just be one issue among many that would have to be evaluated by the party but i believe the party will support senator mccains choice
6402334 actually my understanding is that yesterday fox news reported the r n c said mccain is no longer considering any candidates who are pro choice to your knowledge is that incorrect
6402335 we could do a call all day about senator mccains v p choices frankly were not talking about senator mccains v p choices until he makes a v p choice

6402344 i threw away my vote on ron paul just on impulse knowing he couldnt win

6402348 mufti abu bahsir and nine others are also suspects in planting of bombs in surat city we are interrogating the suspects to find out details of their involvement in the surat bomb case
6402349 the interrogation is still on and the information from the suspects is being collated
6402350 we are investigating the matter and are in touch with the ahmedabad crime branch and other agencies we have got some leads which we are working on
6402351 it will be too early to say that those arrested in ahmedabad blasts are the only ones involved in the planting of bombs in surat since their interrogation is still on

6402363 hes a bit flamboyant but thats one of the reasons i recruited him hes probably one of the best passers in the football league
6402364 in one way we are all just feeling so proud and so happy and so inspired to see our people stand up
6402365 but at the same time we have such a sense of dread we know the chinese can do what they want
6402366 allows us to present our cause in the international arena and to supply a rallying point for tibetans
6402367 the tibetan people have been protesting for many years but no one took notice so a deep rooted resentment has built up
6402368 to push china to enter a dialogue with his holiness
6402369 he is both a spiritual and political leader and most people feel he is working to find a solution in the best way that he can
6402370 i havent seen anyone asking just for autonomy or for the chinese to be more lenient
6402371 we the tibetan people should share the happiness and suffering together
6402372 they are much more mobile they have telephones and internet and a greater sense of national identity
6402373 if we let people see that kind of thing there would never again be any war
6402374 there is no escaping the fact that mr ravi needs medical attention and rest to recuperate
6402375 it is the job of politicians to build the political conditions where no one will become involved in armed actions and where none else loses their lives in these circumstances
6402376 it really sucked but we are not going to tell you

6402385 the reason i always continue to be confident is because i trust valentino so much i like his way of thinking he is always positive and this rubs off on everyone else he never complains or criticizes on the contrary he is always looking forward and searching for new solutions he has exactly the same approach to problems as i have valentino always has a positive and logical way of thinking like me he has a very good sense of humour and i like this a lot i like him as a person very much the biggest shame is that my age is almost the double his but the level of thinking is the same the only difference is that he is just 29 when i was 29 i never thought about tactics and strategies i have a huge respect for him he is the genius behind the bike
6402386 i am very satisfied with jorges new crew chief who joined us this year ramon forcada he is a very good crew chief as is jeremy burgess jb is an easy and sophisticated guy he hates to worry about political correctness like me now both he and ramon are combining their wealth of experience with the new technology very successfully regarding jorges bike specifically i understand very well what ramon is doing with jorge and with jorges bike i speak with him regularly and i am satisfied that we have the same recognition about jorge
6402387 our entire team is made up of good people and good workers as far as our riders are concerned we have a very strong weapon valentino is the present and jorge is the future

6402421 is it typical for a losing candidate to have their own whip team no but its also not usual for a losing candidate to get 18 million votes either
6402422 we have been and are working closely with the obama campaign to make sure we have an exciting and unified convention
6402423 our delegate whips along with the obama delegate whips are a part of a team that will be on the floor of the convention to make sure delegates have everything they need whether thats answering questions or passing out signs during hillarys speech the whips are a traditional part of every conventions floor operations

6402432 amica mia sei troppo pesante e non riuscirei a sostenerti con il mio soffio per tutta la durata del viaggio per ti posso aiutare a raggiungere la riva e chiedere alla mia amica onda di portarti dove vuoi
6402433 salta su le disse e tieniti forte che si parte
6402434 siamo arrivati le disse londa ora ti poser sulla riva e vedrai che tra breve arriver qualcuno a prenderti per accudirti ed essere felice di guardarti e mostrarti agli amici io ritorno a girare per il mare ma di qualsiasi cosa dovessi avere bisogno affida un messaggio alle mie sorelle o al vento e torner da te
6402435 grazie rispose la conchiglia grazie del passaggio e della tua amicizia addio
6402436 di nulla amica mia disse londa allontanandosi abbiamo fatto molta strada insieme e il lungo cammino crea le amicizie addio e buona fortuna
6402437 com delicato pensava la conchiglia si vede che deve tenere molto a me come sono felice
6402438 mi sento in gabbia pensavo di poter essere felice dando la felicit a qualcuno e invece ho perso la mia libert e non ho fatto felice nessuno se non per pochi istanti
6402439 ma tu hai fatto felice mio padre mia madre e me e doni felicit a tutti quelli che vengono per vedere la tua bellezza le tue forme e i tuoi colori e per questo sei tenuta pulita spolverata e sei adagiata su un morbido panno di velluto
6402440 e vero ma sono solo pochi istanti e poi non sono io la causa della loro felicit anche se la mia bellezza la pu accendere e mi vedono solo le persone che volete voi e tutte le altre e le tartarughe della mia spiaggia dove sono e il caldo vento dei tropici che mi accarezzava e mi toglieva la sabbia di dosso al tramonto dove finito non lo sento pi chiusa dentro la scatola di legno e vetro mi manca il mare e non sento pi il rumore delle onde e i gabbiani che volano felici nel cielo oh il rumore del mare e della risacca quanto mi manca

6402463 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

6402466 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus

6402469 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6402470 but he said this project really looked like it was doable

6402473 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6402474 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6402475 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6402476 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6402477 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful

6402484 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6402485 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6402486 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6402487 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6402488 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6402489 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6402490 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6402491 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6402492 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6402493 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6402494 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6402495 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6402496 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6402497 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6402498 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6402499 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6402500 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

6402509 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6402510 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6402511 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6402512 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6402513 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6402514 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6402515 this is a planning took where all things are going

6402517 ive not seen a fabio capello team play worse than that the second half was diabolical
6402518 some of the players are not recognisable from the ones who play week in week out in the prem steven gerrard is not a left winger we are killing him
6402519 he has to be in the middle of the pitch and be part of the game i was full of optimism before the game but its difficult to be optimistic after that
6402520 hundred grand a week and they cant even beat the czechs they should learn a thing or two from our boys in china
6402521 ive not seen a fabio capello team play worse than that the second half was diabolical
6402522 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6402523 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6402524 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6402525 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6402526 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

6402533 they dont think we can do it but it just fires me up there are going to be critics no matter what you do
6402534 its not kick and run its not longball its not depending on one player to get it done
6402535 no we dont have mia no we dont have abby no we dont have all of those pioneers who built the program but in my mind weve got 18 stars and id rather have a team of 18 united people than a team with a few stars
6402536 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6402537 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6402538 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6402539 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6402540 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6402541 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6402542 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6402543 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6402544 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6402545 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6402546 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6402547 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6402548 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6402549 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6402550 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6402551 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6402552 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6402553 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6402554 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6402555 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6402556 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6402557 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6402558 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6402559 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6402560 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6402561 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6402562 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6402563 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6402564 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6402565 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6402566 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6402567 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6402568 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6402569 he caught me he kicked me straight in my head
6402570 with carlos you expect that you know what hes dirty i wish i could say otherwise but i played in mls and ive seen it there is no place for it its reckless its there for everyone to see but again i kind of expect it
6402571 i think you would rather have him come and man up and say look i dont like you im going to kick you and im going to do all that
6402572 you can almost respect it in a funny way but he has this way about him where he kicks and punches hes an asshole and he wants to come and be your friend theres just no place for it
6402573 coach what do you think of a big team like the united states needing the referee to help it win a game against guatemala
6402574 what did you think of guatemalas red card which was obviously a make up call for the usa red card
6402575 well if cabrera did that in the united states hed probably get arrested here theyll probably give him a medal
6402576 he tried one card it failed then another it failed again after much faffing he sent an aide out to get cash
6402577 cesc told the girls to order whatever they wanted they even had two rounds of lobster soup and salmon galore
6402578 he apologised profusely and paid when his aide turned up with the money
6402579 we were very happy to have cesc eating in our restaurant they seemed to have a great evening

6402584 we review our parking charges annually and they are comparable with other councils in the area
6402585 we price our parking to encourage local people and tourists to shop locally as we are aware that in a sparsely populated rural area such as eden that doesnt have good public transport links the increasing costs of private transport are a major issue
6402586 the city councils car parking charges are fixed on an annual basis and reviewed accordingly as part of the city councils car parking strategy and transport plans which are relevant to the local area
6402587 fees and charges are reconsidered on an annual basis taking into account the needs of local people opposed to national ones

6402599 i went out on a limb for him after the kinsey assassination attempt and i havent had cause to regret it
6402600 hes a good guy and its useful to have someone on the inside at nid
6402601 no no really i knew a girl at the academy who could do this
6402602 no problem we all expect weird shit if we get involved with sg 1
6402603 you dont want to know what else i found in there
6402604 now as i see it theres a really elegant way of accomplishing the objective here without messing up my leather couch would you sign off on that jack would that be within um parameters
6402605 so why tonight i see why you chose to do it but why now this what tension forbidden attraction has been going on between us for years now why tonight
6402606 something was gonna blow plus carters finally having some kind of breakthrough you heard about her cop
6402607 i heard breakthrough about not being so hung up on you you mean
6402608 thanks for never making me discuss why you and not her
6402609 you mean what forward from here or so far and me try to make you talk what am i stupid
6402610 on the other hand have you considered would an orgy at this point make things better or worse
6402611 tell me something would a full scale orgy at this point make things better or worse
6402612 fuck you you know exactly what i mean and you were listening i knew you would want to
6402613 daniel im mad im hung over i just fucked malcolm fucking barrett in your bed while my commanding officer listened in after having sex with you on your sofa i dont think its fucking time to calm down yet okay
6402614 look you think im good for you carter and we are good in the field in the field
6402615 you need someone in your life whos your equal not your co someone who wouldnt have all the baggage wed have you maybe havent found him yet but maybe you have who knows its just it was time
6402616 time to do something i probably should have done something before tealc got involved with ishta but
6402617 the main problem is how the hell is it your responsibility anyway colonel jack youre nuts in fact youre both nuts
6402618 i mean i got laid it was great its embarrassing its a relief in a way to have this all out in the open i mean its all dragged on my subconscious for fucking years you
6402619 jesus you think i didnt see the attraction how it came and went how we all wanted what we couldnt have and the other shit the the shitty fates the people we lost
6402620 the jealousy and the weirdness but now after last nights little escapade weve got
6402621 i felt like a a cow being driven into a chute you left me one exit one way to go and i took it
6402622 oh come on youve been flirting with the guy for years theres nothing wrong with a little friendly stress relief and i thought you said you have some history with him
6402623 what i really cant believe is that youd trust him with all this shit to blackmail us with now
6402624 carter you already said you trust him hes with us now as much as davis is or ferretti its just one more secret
6402625 one more trustworthy person more or less knowing youre gay or bi or whatever doesnt really matter does it and here im all worried about malcolm knowing some dark secret about you letting your cat out of the bag so to speak
6402626 its not much of a secret at all is it not with sgc its part of why you have to cave sometimes to people like kinsey isnt it
6402627 expendable but you just keep surprising them dont you no wonder you couldnt get promoted
6402628 the things i miss by not getting to hang out in the mens locker room jesus
6402629 theres an energy to this a pattern that you and i pairing off as beautiful and as risky as that is and that setting sam up with barrett setting her free to be the butterfly like in that stupid sixties poem
6402630 yeah i always preferred the hunt them down and kill them option to the set them free option myself
6402631 look i love sam you love sam i love you we all love each other the three of us tealc the team you know the undercurrents of all this shit have helped us as much as theyve hurt us through the years
6402632 so youre saying that last night was a big mistake that i was right before that carter was
6402633 i never thought it would be you who would be endorsing the hoary old rules of the military establishment
6402634 im not im saying jack was right to break the rules and to finally push me into bed i wanted it he wanted it it was everything right and good
6402635 what are you saying daniel because i cant take much more of this right now
6402636 so you walked in on me and barrett with that
6402637 goddammit daniel i had to do something i made a decision and maybe it was the wrong decision but there it was so it was barrett so what im not telling you to marry the guy carter jesus we had to do something to to vent the steam so its vented so were talking now finally seven years later thats good isnt it
6402638 i never thought id hear colonel jack oneill endorsing actually talking about relationships and feelings
6402639 guys talking is good what jack did is good but theres more what we need is a new paradigm thats what im trying to say
6402640 look none of us will ever pick out china again or even once none of us will ever be married again
6402641 the military is right about one thing one thing theyre trying to prevent with the frat rules the team comes first the team
6402642 i said it to tealc once right after we lost you because because of kelowna i said no one can ever understand what we mean to each other what we are to each other
6402643 you know a tripod is the least stable structure of all
6402644 yes certainly for a structure but a triangle as a foundation as a building block its the most stable shape of all

6402662 the real world powell in the race to represent the 10th congressional district towns has refused according to the paper
6402663 its certainly not because were scared or the congressman is scared
6402664 if powell wants to talk about ways to improve the district thats one thing but if hes calling on a debate simply to stand up and pontificate than were not interested
6402665 but we will not have a back and forth with him about his false allegations about the congressman

6402679 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6402680 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6402681 what we have here is confirmation that it really is a major factor
6402682 if it has been shown that wars can impact a babys brain development in this way then it follows that other types of stress like domestic violence severe anxiety bereavement or other types of loss could have the same effect

6402744 to rejoice over victory by violence is to rejoice over slaughter the wise ruler sees a military triumph as a funeral
6402745 if only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them but the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being and who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart

6402751 the fact is that the private system exists and like it or not it is here to stay
6402752 we need to accommodate it in order for the public system to prosper
6402753 we have one of the most costly and least efficient health systems of any industrialized country
6402754 its not for everyone its not all doctors who will go to the private side thats for sure and its not feasible everywhere
6402755 does it make sense in the face of a shortage of operating rooms to ban surgeons who provide 90 per cent of their services in a hospital from performing five to 10 per cent of their surgeries in a private clinic

6402816 the ecological effects of war like its horrific toll on human life are exponential when the bush administration parts one and two and its congressional allies sent troops to iraq to topple saddam husseins regime they not only ordered these men and women to commit crimes against humanity they also commanded them to perpetrate crimes against nature former chief united nations weapons inspector hans blix prior to the 2003 invasion of iraq said the environmental consequences of the iraq war could be more ominous than the issue of war and peace itself blix was right months of bombing during the first gulf war by the united states and great britain left a deadly and insidious legacy tons of shell casings bullets and bomb fragments laced with depleted uranium in all the united states hit iraqi targets with more than 970 radioactive bombs and missiles depleted uranium du is a rather benignsounding name for uranium 238 the trace element left behind when fissionable material is extracted from uranium 235 for nuclear reactors and weapons for decades this waste was a nuisance by the late 1980s there were nearly a billion tons of the radioactive material piled at plutonium processing plants across the country then pentagon weapons designers discovered a use for the tailings they could be molded into bullets and bombs uranium is denser than lead making it perfect for armorpenetrating weapons designed to destroy tanks armored personnel carriers and bunkers when tank busting bombs explode depleted uranium oxidizes into microscopic fragments that float through the air carried on the desert winds for decades inhaled the lethal bits of carcinogenic dust stick to the lungs eventually wreaking havoc in the form of tumors hemorrhages ravaged immune systems and leukemia more than 15 years later the dire health consequences of our first radioactive bombing campaign in this region are coming into focus since 1990 the incidence rate of leukemia in iraq has increased over 600 percent
6402817 as for the ludicrous claims on the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel reprocessing spent nuclear fuel was supposed to be one alternative to lots and lots of mining forever and forever the biggest experiment in reprocessing was at sellafield in britain in 2005 after decades of contamination and leaks and general spewing of horrible matter into the ocean air and land around the reprocessing plant sellafield was shut down because a bigger than usual leak of fuel dissolved in nitric acid some tens of thousands of gallons was discovered it contained enough plutonium to make about 20 nuclear bombs a nuclear dump site just six miles from the famous champagne vineyards in france is leaking radioactive waste into the groundwater according to the french nuclear safety authority the wall of a storage cell fissured while concrete was being added to a recent layer of nuclear waste it showed levels of radioactivity leaking from another dump site run by the same company in normandy at up to 90 times above european safety limits that waste has seeped into underground water used by farmers with contamination spreading into the countryside and threatening dairy production the champagne site will receive a total of 4 thousand terabequerels of tritium more than three times the amount of tritium waste as the dump site in normandy
6402818 some people have proposed using nuclear energy to fuel unfettered tar sands expansion unfortunately many of albertas government and industry leaders are currently supporting the latter option that is instead of choosing innovation and conservation as a means to ensure a safe healthy and clean energy future for all albertans these representatives have chosen to pursue one of canadas most dangerous polluting and inefficient energy options even more alarming is how quickly nuclear proponents have been mobilizing in an effort to build multiple reactors and have them online as soon as possible having been rejected already by tar sands companies that recognized the liability and unfeasibility of nuclear power in alberta nuclear proponents are currently campaigning to gain support and clientele in communities across the province nuclear energy was not recognized as a clean energy source in the kyoto protocol but it continues to be touted as a global solution to climate change with the threat of nuclear energy looming in alberta it is important that all the facts around this dangerous and dirty energy source are known beyond the environmentally destructive mining of uranium nuclear energy produces both in extraction and production large quantities of radioactive waste spent fuel from candu reactors contains over 200 deadly radioactive elements plutonium for example remains radioactive for over 24 400 years these highly toxic byproducts make long term storage a serious political and environmental catastrophe there is not one safe and secure disposal option for the highly radioactive waste produced by nuclear power stations and the history of canadian candu reactors is plagued with problems with many of them breaking down early or being decommissioned as the costs of repairs are far greater than initial startup costs it is also critical to note that accidents do happen with 22 accidents occurring since the catastrophic incident at chernobyl plutonium can be released into the environment as a result of nuclear energy development concern over the harmful effects of plutonium is growing because of discoveries about the subtle effects of low level radiation plutonium may be many times more dangerous than previously thought besides at every step of nuclear power generation greenhouse gases are emitted approximately 240 000 to 366 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide are produced every year from plant construction uranium mining milling uranium ore road transportation fuel fabrication conversion and refining activities beyond these direct emissions low grade uranium mined from saskatchewan is upgraded largely in the united states using coal fired power the most carbon intensive energy producer too often local governments and community members are only presented with the slick advertising and false promises of people who stand to gain substantially from fostering a nuclear power industry in alberta

6402925 we in the senate understand that not only the approval of this contract is important but also the bill on marine and aerial interception with the acquisition of speedboats and radars to fight the traffic of guns drugs and people that is to say a complete package to fight those crimes

6402928 be careful crossing the streets and obey all traffic laws on the way to school and on your way from school
6402929 its that time of year and often the time of day when we get in a rush and theres a lot of traffic and a lot of foot traffic around the schools at that time
6402930 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well

6402945 its the only time i get to see them because i work nights so it gives us some time together
6402946 anything we can do to involve the community and parents is a bonus
6402947 we had a good year last year and were looking to build on that
6402948 si sab an que el avi n estaba roto por qu lo utilizan
6402949 this is an unspeakable tragedy and no words can express our grief sorrow and care for the edwards family

6402958 los tomates que se cortaron ayer son los que hoy est n aqu
6402959 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6402960 they are moving into new states and settling or establishing new settlements in communities where local officials arent acquainted with them that creates some misunderstanding on zoning issues or other unique factors in amish practice
6402961 as they live their lives they really do not become very involved with government
6402962 one family doesnt go there is a group of them that goes like two or three or four

6402964 those with great traditional courses are less impacted by economic trends than others because there is tremendous demand
6402965 there may be fewer rounds played and less activity but in those clubs the difference is more marginal

6402967 50 new courses have been built in the 75 mile area surrounding new york alone

6402970 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
6402971 unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
6402972 the icc has got the unambiguous understanding from a collective view on pakistan
6402973 we all know theres work to be done and as long as we work hard as a team and stay together as a unit well have a good chance
6402974 no ones going to guarantee us qualification if we work hard weve got the players
6402975 rios ferdinand had a great season hes been a great servant for manchester united and england john terry had a great season last year and is also a big captain with experience
6402976 i think either one of those two could be captain and not forgetting steven gerrard there are great leaders and captains all the way through the team so were lucky
6402977 we all congratulated jt and rio did so at the end of the day we all stick together and we all believe in our captain
6402978 something has to change but that is up to the galway board and that is what i explained to them
6402979 it is up to them to change it and it is not up to anyone else it is up to them to look at it closely and see how they are going to win under that arrangement
6402980 they are not going to win under that arrangement they have to find some way where they start on a level playing field with every other county and if they do that and have a full team i think galway are as good as any other county out there
6402981 gathered in the mall and small pockets of fighting broke out
6402982 it would have been a snub to william and harry to have left their girlfriends names off the guest list

6402984 i have said it before i am happy at hearts and am looking forward to the new season under the new manager
6402985 i want to keep improving as a player and hearts is the best place for me to do that just now
6402986 they did very well at parkhead recently and well have to be on top of our game
6402987 we didnt play badly against rangers and we can take the positives from that into this weekend were taking things one game at a time and the objective is to improve on last season and i think were capable of doing that
6402988 it is every footballers ambition to play for their country in front of their own fans
6402989 i hereby declare quasar the official tangency news herald first class of the most exalted of geeks who want to know so let it be written so let it be done

6402991 i finished strong with wobbly arms but still got over the line first
6402992 im really happy i couldnt ask for much more than that to win the semi
6402993 its the first time ive won a semi im usually the second or third fastest time
6402994 i didnt look where i was i knew the swede was next to me and if i beat him then i would probably make it through
6402995 i just hung on him i saw him die and took my opportunity while i had it and kicked as hard as i could
6402996 for me to have a crack like that has got to give me a lot of inspiration going into the finals tomorrow and the next day
6402997 im looking forward to the challenges ive got to recover and put up my a game plus 10 per cent tomorrow
6402998 two finals in the olympics you cant ask for much more than that

6403011 if i may offer a silver lining there would have been a two year gap between half blood prince and the much anticipated first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows which opens in november 2010
6403012 until then i knew hamas through my father who lived a very modest and loving life

6403050 els ltims casos de viol ncia masclista shan donat sense que els assassins tingueren antecedents de maltractaments i en estos casos les mesures policials i judicials no els poden preveure ni atendre si no analitzem les condicions en qu es produ xen

6403060 the victim approached him and learned parsons had suffered a heart problem and had surgery using his name but threatened to blow up his house if the victim went to the police
6403061 the victim and his friends had reason to take this threat seriously because parsons had served 15 years in prison for aggravated arson
6403062 during the execution of the warrant detectives recovered between 300 and 400 pieces of medical records including bills financial documents basically any kind of correspondence relating to the identity theft
6403063 when his house was searched mr parsons was not home and detectives went to check if he was at northwestern hospital he had either not been at the hospital or had just left but he arrived at his residence when the detectives returned and was arrested
6403064 it was all billed through medicare and medicaid and basically exhausted all of his available benefits

6403087 i started at sheffield wednesday in 1987 under howard wilkinson and it was very daunting he was quite straight laced and one of my duties as an apprentice was to take him a cup of lemon tea every morning he was an old school style manager who was very well organised and well drilled whose teams were very hard working and played a long ball style however they were successful and i think the team were sixth in the top flight when he was sacked
6403088 peter eustace came and went inside four months and then ron atkinson arrived but i was still playing for the youth and reserve teams as that stage he arrived in the middle of 1989 and was at the opposite end of the spectrum to howard wilkinson we were relegated at the end of his first full season but we won the second division championship and beat manchester united in the league cup final in 1991 the fans loved big ron as his sides played good football but then he left and went to aston villa that was three managers i had seen come and go and had yet to make my debut
6403089 i was a 20 year old and we played against manchester city at maine road and won 1 0 it was a bit of a whirlwind for me and you go from playing in front of a few people to playing on front over 30 000 supporters and you cant prepare for that experience until it finally happens we had some great players at that time like carlton palmer danny wilson chris waddle nigel pearson and john sheridan it was a good place to be and you get swept along with it but looking back there were some great players and we played in europe trevor francis was the manager and i am grateful for the opportunity he gave me he was there for four years and had one bad season and was replaced by david pleat
6403090 david pleat was a fantastic coach who had some great ideas but i wasnt so sure about him as a manager the team started to struggle a bit and he was replaced by big ron who had a cameo role for a few months and then danny wilson took over as manager my contract was up in 1999 and the bosman ruling had just started so i thought it was time for a change after 12 years
6403091 i went to birmingham city but for whatever reason it didnt really happen for me there you have to hold your hand up at times and i would admit that i never really performed to the best of my ability and that happens to all players at some time in their career i then suffered a ruptured medial ligament that kept me out of action and there was a parting of the ways with trevor francis steve bruce came in and it was quite refreshing for me as i was back in the squad and we got promoted back to the premier league but i was only ever going to leave the club
6403092 that would have to be chris waddle he had the sort of style you could never teach and was so unorthodox yet he was very deceptive he was a left footed player who played on the right wing and could dip his shoulder and go either way he was fantastic and you could pass the ball to him and he would keep it and take the pressure off he was also a down to earth bloke who had no edge to him at all bearing in mind he was 32 when he arrived at sheffield wednesday he must have been unbelievable in his heyday
6403093 that would have to be the second leg of the league cup semi final against blackburn in 1993 we had won the first leg 4 2 and the atmosphere was amazing it was a sunny day and the game was live on television and the stadium was packed i cant actually remember too much about the game other than we won but it was the occasion that i remember best of all
6403094 im not angling for a move but if the opportunity arose before the transfer deadline and if something were to happen and fulham give me the green light then who knows last season wasnt good enough for myself anybody that doesnt play week in week out is obviously going to be disappointed
6403095 but its something as a footballer as a striker you become used to strikers are probably rotated more than anybody
6403096 i am sad to be leaving the fa an organisation it has been a privilege to lead but i believe it is in the best interests of all parties
6403097 i have always endeavoured to do my job with passion decency and integrity and i believe i am leaving a strong legacy for the future
6403098 we have achieved a lot over the past three and a half years opening the new wembley stadium implementing the structural review and increasing our broadcast and commercial contracts to record income levels
6403099 the organisation is in better financial health than ever before and i am also delighted to have seen the recent launch of the respect programme which is very important to me
6403100 on the pitch im convinced that in fabio capello the england team has the right manager and a genuine chance of success while i also believe the plans for the national football centre will benefit english football in the long term
6403101 i would like to pay tribute to the fa board for their strong support and especially thank my colleagues at the fa for their tremendous efforts during my tenure
6403102 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mikaels versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season
6403103 his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mikael has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6403104 according to agreements the club spurs had until august 18 to send their proposals so far these proposals have not been received
6403105 given the deadline has expired and the uncertainty of the situation not allowing the club to find a replacement for andrei arshavin zenit considers the possibility of transferring the player to tottenham closed
6403106 i feel great just ordered some more vitamins and stuff i was just exercising i taped a 20 minute workout and played it back at high speed on my machine so it only took 10 minutes i got a great workout

6403131 could peter crook chief executive of provident financial redeem doorstep lending
6403132 it was awesome it gave me 1 a major reality check 2 what to do about where i am at
6403133 understanding how a system of storage cataloguing can work and increase productivity
6403134 i realised how unorganised and dangerous my back up system is
6403135 knowledge of a brilliant system that can change the potential of my data catalogue
6403136 knowledge of workflow how to archive images i am looking forward to getting my catalogues up
6403137 the library based collection management was really beneficial to me
6403138 it made things clear in terms of how i must organise my library
6403139 my workflow will improve as will my skills to a higher level
6403140 a complete understanding of the whole workflow using the best of various software environment and a clear system to move files through production into an archive that is fully backed up and secure this will help me manage and preserve my digital archive for years to come thank you so much also really cool insights into the future of imaging
6403141 i have realised the crucial importance of non destructive workflow and its benefits for building and retaining a value rich archive
6403142 unbelievable knowledge that can take me into the future and allow me to manage my data in an effective and efficient and long lasting and scalable manner
6403143 a great understanding of the importance to back up work and how to do it successfully
6403144 a much better understanding of dam and a solid well tested cataloguing system to adhere to
6403145 having to account for my images and knowing where they are
6403146 peters approach to organisation is quite radical compared to the way i have been working he makes use of software to create faster more efficient workflow i gained a good understanding of dam in general and information on backup systems hard drives etc
6403147 im feeling quite emotional i hardly have words i am so grateful for all that we have been exposed to and how it is lifting our vision
6403148 we are really grateful for microsofts support of the photographers on the african photo entrepreneur programme
6403149 having researched various options i was convinced it was the best of all the systems available
6403150 the great thing is that with microsoft taking over the pc version of the programme is now on a par with the original mac version which is good news for the photographers on pc expression media is currently the best programme on the market for a photographer to manage a database of images and it is a great kick start for african photo entrepreneurs starting to grapple with managing a digital library
6403151 the ease with which children can access rated content is startling for this reason it is important that isps share the responsibility by offering packages that meet the connectivity needs of the average family while negating some of the content risks
6403152 we have rated some 2 million adult and malicious websites that are restricted to package users essentially we block adult and malicious sites at the isp level so you dont need to for the first time you can rest assured that it is that much more difficult for your child to access restricted sites unintentionally or otherwise

6403158 i recognised that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
6403159 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
6403160 i think that was something the press elaborated on that didnt happen he didnt turn i shot him in the back
6403161 and i said wouldnt it be something if i killed this individual i would become famous i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
6403162 i perceived him at the time and wrongly judged him to be a phoney here he is at this ritzy building and he had been singing of love and other things at that time it angered me
6403163 we love you from the bottom of our hearts and trust youll make it in 2012

6403169 the government has been looking at energy from the wrong end of the telescope
6403170 the scale of its failure to plan for britains energy security has been brought into sharp relief by the georgian crisis which underlines the risks of increasing dependence on foreign energy sources as north sea oil supplies run down
6403171 rather than use its period in office to reduce britains dependency on vulnerable supplies from unstable regions labour has dithered and flip flopped for over a decade instead of an energy policy we have a potential economic environmental and national security disaster waiting to happen
6403172 but we have an enormous opportunity to create real energy independence for the uk freeing ourselves from the shackles of foreign oil coal and gas
6403173 renewable energy is no longer a pipe dream it is realistic and achievable all it requires is the leadership and vision that has been lacking under years of tired labour thinking
6403174 thats why today i am setting out liberal democrat proposals to become energy independent by 2050 this will require the kind of ambition and political will that succeeded in putting man on the moon
6403175 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss

6403177 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6403178 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6403179 she was an effective legislator who was dedicated to helping small businesses improving local schools expanding job opportunities for ohioans and ensuring that more of them have access to health care
6403180 i wanted somebody whom i felt could carry on what i tried to do for 30 years in that congressional district

6403183 the president ordered us to stop where we were we are not pulling out and pulling back troops behind this administrative border into the territory of south ossetia
6403184 might be useful to come out at this stage and get an update and be able to go back and brief the president
6403185 its a very gratifying time because were in a position where we believe were going to be able to hand most security functions to the iraqis
6403186 my presence can identify whether there are any final obstacles
6403187 i miss the girls i miss being on stage with them its a blessing when we work together were so looking forward to working with each other again and we just need to find a time in our diaries when we can get into the studio together
6403188 thats a great thing i think it would be a good mix
6403189 weve heard it in some pretty weird places ive heard they sing it in scottish prisons when they bring paedophiles in thats pretty weird
6403190 we wrote a song it did really well i dont really see what there is to be upset about you get labelled one hit wonders but thats more hits than most people have and its not like weve disappeared without a trace

6403193 we might even do it at petes house in a big barn were definitely going to honour those tickets somehow but as far as the festival goes our hands are tied

6403197 sunt intarzieri temporare in procesarea proiectelor de dezvoltare a resurselor umane
6403198 am cerut directorului general al apdrp sa ia de urgenta cateva masuri de ameliorare a functionarii directiei de control antifrauda din cadrul agentiei care in opinia mea impreuna cu directia de audit ar fi trebui sa se autosesizeze si sa nu asteptam un audit al ce pentru a clarifica anumite aspecte ce trebuiau clarificate de conducere in acest sens au fost facute niste controale pe proiecte cu potential risc si au fost facute si niste schimbari in cadrul conducerii acestei directii
6403199 impresia mea dupa citirea acestei scrisori n r a ce a fost ca intre altele in aceasta directie a fost un pic de anchilozare in ultima vreme si initiative pe care ar fi trebui sa le aiba dincolo de controalele sistemice atunci cand observa situatii de risc trebuie sa le aiba cred ca acolo trebuia mai multa initiativa si i am cerut directorului sa ia masuri in acest sens
6403200 este probabil si asta o sa vedem dupa ce fac impreuna cu doamna secretar de stat cornelia mihai o analiza si o vina a unor presoane din conducere printr o insuficienta implicare si printr o cadere in rutina care face sa nu mai observam anumite aspecte care pot sa gripeze sistemul sau sa creezeastfel de probleme
6403201 pe parcurs au aparut elemente pe care auditorii comisiei au considerat ca nu sunt suficient de clar precizate in proceduri
6403202 cu siguranta voi face ameliorari in managementul agentiei care tin nu numai de persoane care pot tine si de persoane si de modul de organizare a agentiei pentru a ne asigura ca astfel de situatii vor aparea cat mai rar posibil pentru ca aceasta corespondenta cu comisia astfel de misiuni de audit vor fi permanente in perioada urmatoare
6403203 intentia mea prima intentie nu a fost sa ies in presa si sa discutam aceste chestiuni ci sa iau masuri cat mai repede
6403204 noi am hotarat sa ne mobilizam si sa il trimitem inainte de vacanta de vara de la comisie tocmai pentru ca reluarea platilor in conditii de siguranta sa se faca cat mai repede nu stiu daca am gresit sau nu probabil ca am gresit si aici imi asum faptul ca probabil ar fi trebuie sa cer agentiei sa comunice beneficiarilor aceste intarzieri care ar fi putut sa apara pentru ca unii dintre ei ar putea fi afectati de aceste intarzieri dar in rest responsabilitatea mea era sa iau masuri si sa ma asigur ca platile se reiau in conditii de siguranta cat mai repede
6403205 m am concentrat din punctul de vedere al fondurilor europene pe apia pe problemele de la bruxelles pe ceea ce tine de un ministru atata timp cat in minister avem secretari de stat si directori ai unei autoritati fiecare are responsabilitati
6403206 ceea ce pot sa imi reprosez este ca nu am urmarit mai atent anumite probleme tehnice eu stiam de cand am acceptat postul de ministru ca la agricultura asa cum stau treburile acum chiar si ca min istru trebuie sa intri in detalii tehnice pe care daca nu le urmaresti pot sa apara probleme mi se poate reprosa si dintr o parte si din alta acum sau dupa ce imi termina mandatul ca mi am facut treaba mai mult sau mai putin bine pana atunci incerc sa iau masurile in timp real pentru ca situatia sa se remedieze in cel mai scurt timp si sa nu se mai repete
6403207 ok desigur si va rog sa ma scuzati sa nu considerati ca va raspund pe un ton ironic dar ceea ce mi reprosez este ca nu am incercat sa fiu mai destepti decat toti conducatorii agentiei care au fost inaintea mea pentru ca ceea ce ne a solicitat comisia in acest moment este sa reconstruim toate procedurile din momentul 0 deci poate ca ar fi trebuit sa fiu mai destept decat toti cei care au luat decizii inaintea mea sa pun la indoiala toate deciziile luate anterior sa nu am incredere in sistem pot sa imi reprosez ca am avut acesta incredere in sistem
6403208 sa nu ne prinda sfarsitul lui septembrie inceputul lui octombrie fara ca situatia sa fie rezolvata
6403209 todays judgment reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the united states government in the supposed war on terror
6403210 its the first round of a general election so the state of washington in a literal sense and historic sense no longer has a primary the parties really cant choose their own nominees anymore
6403211 they best represent the district because theyre the top vote getters
6403212 theres a certain logic that says they ought to be the ones squaring off in november theyll have to campaign through november and be accountable to voters thats healthy for our process
6403213 im not sure where its going to go we dont have any immediate plans to claim harm from what happened yesterday in a legal sense well see how this all pans out
6403214 im still optimistic well win that lawsuit and the top two will be found to be unconstitutional
6403215 we believe we can compete with any team in this league
6403216 i dont know if thats being cocky or calm cool and collected you can call it whatever you want
6403217 our offensive line penalties have been down through two games
6403218 we praised our offensive line for how well it played all last year and how well we ran the ball but we led the league in penalties on the offensive line were not skipping over that
6403219 that means all positions from what ive seen were working toward that direction at the same time we have to concentrate on playing football we cant always be thinking about penalties we just have to be smart and not put ourselves in bad positions
6403220 ill be all right depending upon how well i can protect my hand from here on
6403221 i dont care who will stamp my passport a minister in gaza or the president in ramallah
6403222 both are using us as tools in their internal conflicts i wish that an earthquake would come and take both sides from our life
6403223 when you break it down they rush a lot more than they drop into coverage
6403224 theres a myriad of geopolitical factors rumbling in the background russia iran
6403225 as far as i am concerned all that stuff is paper talk
6403226 i have said it before i am happy at hearts and am looking forward to the new season under the new manager
6403227 i want to keep improving as a player and hearts is the best place for me to do that just now
6403228 they did very well at parkhead recently and well have to be on top of our game
6403229 we didnt play badly against rangers and we can take the positives from that into this weekend were taking things one game at a time and the objective is to improve on last season and i think were capable of doing that
6403230 it is every footballers ambition to play for their country in front of their own fans
6403231 we all know theres work to be done and as long as we work hard as a team and stay together as a unit well have a good chance
6403232 no ones going to guarantee us qualification if we work hard weve got the players
6403233 rios ferdinand had a great season hes been a great servant for manchester united and england john terry had a great season last year and is also a big captain with experience
6403234 i think either one of those two could be captain and not forgetting steven gerrard there are great leaders and captains all the way through the team so were lucky
6403235 we all congratulated jt and rio did so at the end of the day we all stick together and we all believe in our captain

6403241 something has to change but that is up to the galway board and that is what i explained to them
6403242 it is up to them to change it and it is not up to anyone else it is up to them to look at it closely and see how they are going to win under that arrangement
6403243 they are not going to win under that arrangement they have to find some way where they start on a level playing field with every other county and if they do that and have a full team i think galway are as good as any other county out there

6403265 city parks therefore appeals to the public undertakers and religious leaders to ensure they arrive at the cemetery on time it also recommends that wherever possible communities should arrange weekday burials when the opportunity for quietness and reflection are enhanced
6403266 this places a great deal of pressure on cemetery staff and facilities and the situation is aggravated if burial groups are not punctual

6403292 tropical storm fay is not expected to be over the gulf of mexico very long if at all on friday we will continue to monitor fay for any significant deviations to the forecast the most significant change to our forecast for this weekend is seeing a decrease in rain chances and hotter temperatures into the mid and upper 90s
6403293 the most significant issue regarding the slow motion is that fay will likely continue to dump torrential rains along its path and will probably be remembered as a very wet storm
6403294 the turn to the northwest and west northwest keeping fay over land is consistent with most of the computer models
6403295 in follow up meetings with the bar owners we realized there was no way we could have an agreement drawn up and a legally acceptable document by august

6403319 we established very good relations relatively speaking with china and suddenly you break the bridge it would have been easy just to be there
6403320 china daily acts often as a mouthpiece for the government and it also signals how the government feels about an issue
6403321 the fact that this runs on the front page suggests china is very unhappy
6403322 the article here points to the fact that stephen harper has not visited china since taking office in 2006
6403323 for china a major superpower that is a big slight and they continue to hammer down on this point
6403324 but what we will not do is to sacrifice canadian values
6403325 we still dont want anything to do with you in the publics eye

6403351 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia leroi had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program

6403360 we are not hungry we have what we need but the special stuff you need for children is expensive and they dont give it for free my wife is pregnant how can i raise a newborn and a small boy in a classroom with two rubbish bags of possessions
6403361 i havent heard from him today normally he calls every day you never know if something could have happened
6403362 no i am a proud georgian i am proud of my leader he is defending our land against the enemy
6403363 there are people who dont like saakashvili here in this center i think half of them but they keep quiet about it its best not to be heard speaking against him its not patriotic people could get very angry about that
6403364 but this war is not about that russia can have on its borders only slaves or enemies she could not have a free and successful georgia
6403365 the rose revolution was about national pride he personifies that when i see how the whole world is with him during this war it makes me proud to be georgian and certain that somehow we will win
6403366 there is fear nobody really knows what will happen to our country and our people right now people are rallying around the flag and the government even the opposition parties are behind saakashvili now this is about our survival as a free and sovereign state
6403367 the magisterium has not expressly committed itself to an affirmation of a

6403371 i went in there thinking nerd camp but it ended up being something completely different
6403372 i wanted to find something to do over the summer that was free and fun but educational at the same time
6403373 i wasnt expecting to get in the qualifications were wow and i had to write four essays and have teacher recommendations to be accepted

6403375 shes very driven and tries to stay involved in both school and extra activities
6403376 when they were driving us to cambridge from the airport i just looked around at everything and thought this is so surreal
6403377 the courses were really intense its not so much that the work was hard there was just so much
6403378 there was only one time that i was worried and that was when we were dealing with this mutant gene that they said if we got it on us something would grow on us
6403379 shes always been good with science and math my husband says she gets that from him
6403380 ich lege besonderen wert auf seine meinung weil ich wei dass bei ihm keine hintergedanken eine rolle spielen ich habe absolutes vertrauen in seine meinung
6403381 es gab schon mal eine zeit in der sie lieber allein war in ihrer zeit in new york aber die entfernung war nicht so dass man sie mit dem lasso wieder einfangen musste
6403382 rebellion aus prinzip war mir eher fremd ich musste nie rebellieren weil wogegen meine eltern haben mir beigebracht dass es nicht darum geht mit oder gegen den strom sondern seinen eigenen weg zu gehen
6403383 ich stand als er lets dance gewonnen hat im publikum und applaudierte und pl tzlich fragte ich mich bist du eigentlich neidisch auf den diesen jungen guten typen der da mit charme und energie rangegangen ist und es auch noch gewonnen hat dann ist mir klar geworden berhaupt nicht ich finde es einfach blo klasse
6403384 mein vater hat eine unglaubliche disziplin und standhaftigkeit die ich schon bemerkenswert finde gerade in der tourismusbranche gibt es immer wieder aufs und abs trotz allem l sst er sich nicht unterkriegen sondern steht immer wieder auf
6403385 nina ist von natur aus eine sehr kontaktfreudige person und sie kommt sehr schnell mit menschen klar sie hat ein sehr sympathisches auftreten und sie ist sehr beliebt im unternehmen

6403387 was ich an ihr besonders toll finde sie hat gro e fantasie und ist dabei sehr verspielt sie ist manchmal so v llig bedenkenlos so risikofreudig dass es mich sch ttelt
6403388 hopefully the same thing that my campaign has told the american people about me
6403389 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well and collect as many endorsement deals at possible
6403390 what will my son be like when hes your age
6403391 tell me what you did shes beautiful and perfect and i want that for my kid too tell me your secret
6403392 it sounds like an industry reluctant to have a standard set because that may open the doors to insisting upon more accurate labels on certain other products as well
6403393 its much more expensive than we thought it would be
6403394 store brand formula is almost identical to brand name but half the cost
6403395 i would return it to the dealer in a heartbeat
6403396 you have to develop some sort of support system for baby care
6403397 so they could between the two put in 120 000 in one year without incurring any gift tax
6403398 in my husbands first deployment he had forgotten to pay a credit card bill
6403399 it wasnt clear on the statement how much money was owed but when i called the financial institution it refused to give me any information because it was not a joint account and that hurt his credit rating
6403400 fortunately the apartment manager gave me the benefit of the doubt and didnt charge late fees
6403401 with the possibility of combat zone tax free income and a host of allowances separation pay hazardous duty etc added to the monthly bottom line you may be able to use the additional income to pay off pesky credit cards build your emergency fund and even start up or increase your automatic savings into a roth ira thrift savings plan or college savings plan for the kids
6403402 if you dont have a significant other or family member who can regularly take care of your small issues make sure you take the time to list your account numbers and customer service phone numbers and give that information to whomever you are giving power of attorney
6403403 when i deployed anne marie completely took over and it worked so well we left it that way
6403404 i knew it wasnt good to pay off the car in five years id be paying almost double the asking price
6403405 they dont have enough financial education to know about their credit score or high interest rates or the real amount theyre paying on a loan
6403406 if our personnel are worried about their credit card debt or making the next mortgage payment it will affect their military readiness with potentially deadly consequences
6403407 we want to change the spend first borrow to buy mentality that so many americans grow up with
6403408 the subprime market caught a lot of military families in a real lurch just like any family
6403409 when a husband or wife is deployed theres less income and less financial help available
6403410 many enlisted folks are straight out of high school and theres no financial literacy training
6403411 all of a sudden they get a paycheck every two weeks but at the same time theyre underpaid as a result they go to payday loan stores to fill the gap and get into deeper and deeper debt
6403412 everyone in military service needs to be vigilant on what kind of financial transaction theyre getting into
6403413 we cant help everyone in some cases they need to sell the house and face reality
6403414 ive had guys who put just 10 a week 20 a paycheck into savings thats two burger king meals
6403415 you can start saving right up until the day you die
6403416 truly these are good men doughty and true and their swimming has won the day first place in the very world may they rightly claim but in the name of the poor the sickly the lonely old and the weak without voice i hereby claim this gold that with it i may do greater good
6403417 put it this way that guy has some stuff of mine but hes welcome to it
6403418 i mean im not political really but ive had a lucky life if my gold medals can help someone get a hot meal and a place to sleep for a few nights thats okay it doesnt mean i didnt win
6403419 epic performance by four doughty good men and true who soundly defeated the norman french uplifted the hearts of all who saw and enriched the very world thereby
6403420 his disregard for our culture our laws and these games will not go unpunished
6403421 we demand he turn himself in return the medals to the rightful winners and face his punishment for these thefts as well as for his repeated demands that we free tibet and his continued poaching of deer in yu nan province

6403442 but there are still points up for grabs this year and we need to look to maximise them now
6403443 what force india has proved is that we look competitive in race conditions and under the right circumstances can pick up points if the chances come our way
6403444 weve performed well on street courses too and with two in the final part this could be a good opportunity for us
6403445 we need to look for 100 reliability to ensure that whenever these chances come our way we are really able to take advantage
6403446 if we take our eye off the ball we could miss out on getting some good finishes
6403447 that said work for 2009 will step up immensely towards the end of the season so we can make sure we are ready
6403448 i think valencia is a great venue for a race like a little monaco
6403449 it should be some sight to see the cars going past the marina and the boats very reminiscent of the principality

6403459 lewis has had a break he comes into the last section of the championship leading it
6403460 its been an interesting world championship because of what happened in canada and what happened in hungary
6403461 lewis year by the extraordinary standards of the consistency of his first season has been problematic
6403462 he could go away and dwell on if if if total that to another 20 points and he could be streaking away
6403463 weve been pushing hard and ferrari have been pushing hard
6403464 the outcome is going to be determined by the team that continues to develop its car at the fastest rate there is a race on between us from one race to another
6403465 in terms of car set up we need to remember that like monaco the track will be green and dusty on the opening day of practice
6403466 that sometimes tempts you into playing with set up more than you would like so you need to resist that temptation and let the track come to the car
6403467 the most important thing is to be thorough methodical and iterative
6403468 although we arrive at a new race track having undertaken a huge amount of research and armed with an enormous amount of data the reality is its really only the starting point for our engineering team
6403469 we begin practice the way we would at any other circuit but in this instance we need to pay particular attention both to driver feedback and the data generated from the car
6403470 the important thing is not to react too hastily its vital you dont end up going down the wrong path because you only have a limited amount of time to tune the set up before qualifying
6403471 anybody whos studied onboard footage of the circuit will be mindful of the proximity of the concrete barriers in certain areas
6403472 clearly well be packing plenty of spares but hoping we wont need to use them
6403473 spain has become a tremendously important market for formula one over the past five years
6403474 the addition of a second spanish race rightly reflects the sports success and popularity in the market
6403475 everything weve seen about the city and the organisation of this event leads me to believe it will be a fantastic success and set a new standard for formula one
6403476 more importantly it marks a return to city racing something we will also witness in singapore and next year in abu dhabi
6403477 thats something that really engages the people and fans far more than at a purpose built circuit out of town
6403478 a few laps after the start the car became very difficult to drive and my feeling was that the pressure of the tyres was too high
6403479 in those circumstances you simply have to slow down since the grip and the traction become very poor after the first pit stop i realised that the massive lack of grip was still there
6403480 in the last two races weve scored only eight points and clearly that is not enough
6403481 our simulations show a benefit of two to three tenths over one lap and possibly more as the driver has the option to get on the power earlier as the car isnt upset by the gear change
6403482 the driver can be smoother with the acceleration so theres less disturbance when cornering and under power
6403483 we will see an advantage everywhere as you will always ratio the gearbox to get the most out of it at each circuit so its effect over a lap will be fairly consistent from circuit to circuit
6403484 we tested the gearbox for the first time at a shakedown at silverstone and then again for three days at jerez but for such an important component that really isnt enough to be able to validate it
6403485 running it on friday in hungary gave us the opportunity to conduct further testing plus we avoided the penalty of changing gearboxes in the middle of a four race cycle
6403486 with our limited resources the team have done a very good job to get it introduced this season
6403487 ferrari have the ability and resources to work on next years car without having to relax for one moment on continuing the development of the f2008 in a championship that is proving to be very tight between ourselves and our usual opponents

6403497 he shall take care that the laws are faithfully executed
6403498 there were some races where things didnt go well for one reason or another but i was able to collect some precious points
6403499 my position after hungary is better than it was before the race we havent lost anything but we need to get better results consistently from now on every single race will be extremely important and every single point will have a great value the fewer there are the more important they become
6403500 i think the championship will be very tight but i need to have at least one point more than my competitors after the last race this is the sole aim the rest is just details
6403501 ive only seen the new track from an on board camera and it seems to be very fast for a street circuit
6403502 i always love to drive on new tracks and im always very quick to know them i cant wait to race at valencia
6403503 it will be more important than in other places to drive with continuity from friday on
6403504 the correlation between the simulation and reality is more than 95 per cent depending on how much data we have
6403505 youre not getting the complete feeling of the car but you are gaining understanding of the distances and the braking points so its very useful

6403524 students responded overwhelmingly to the ultimate steal last year telling us that they need microsoft office for their studies and want more flexible ways to get the latest version
6403525 this offer provides students with an accessible and convenient means to acquire technology at a great price to help them reach their academic goals the ultimate steal is the latest offer in a long history of compelling academic offers from microsoft to students and were happy to extend the program to several additional countries this year

6403745 during an inventory of ligons vehicle an officer also discovered four american express nyse axp travelers checks that appeared to be counterfeit and other material seized that had personal information including names dates of birth and social security numbers
6403746 one of the main questions is how this individual came to have all this information we believe it was being done by use of the internet
6403747 she was an effective legislator who was dedicated to helping small businesses improving local schools expanding job opportunities for ohioans and ensuring that more of them have access to health care
6403748 i wanted somebody whom i felt could carry on what i tried to do for 30 years in that congressional district
6403749 she did it she took it to a higher level a new level she made me so proud
6403750 as to cause a substantial likelihood of depreciation in property values
6403751 she gave me some useful information about retail businesses we should contact that would be a good fit for our corridor

6403755 and i just have to hope it doesnt rain all night because if it does it overflows
6403756 if a resident has a problem the site managers may say ill get to it
6403757 if residents are intimidated or harassed by a site manager residents can be afraid of them tenants need to let us know and well bring managers in and hold them accountable
6403758 so for instance if a property manager or maintenance supervisor is not telling headquarters about issues whether theyre crime related or complaints we dont know about them
6403759 there was an actual contract but because of a number of issues work got stopped and everybody dropped the ball and no one picked it up
6403760 we are changing managers and relocating managers we are restructuring were remanaging we have key people in the right places and people to be held accountable

6403766 the music is so beautiful it just fills your heart
6403767 this is a learning and retirement program open to any adult interested in a learning experience

6403770 ive been a fan of the opera since i was about 6

6403775 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss

6403777 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6403778 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6403779 she was an effective legislator who was dedicated to helping small businesses improving local schools expanding job opportunities for ohioans and ensuring that more of them have access to health care

6403789 i recognised that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
6403790 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
6403791 i think that was something the press elaborated on that didnt happen he didnt turn i shot him in the back
6403792 and i said wouldnt it be something if i killed this individual i would become famous i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
6403793 i perceived him at the time and wrongly judged him to be a phoney here he is at this ritzy building and he had been singing of love and other things at that time it angered me

6403820 although the man was unsuccessful in his attempt to steal the vehicle this would have been a traumatic incident for the owner of the car

6403822 this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can
6403823 these enormous price hikes will be a huge blow to millions of people already wondering just how theyre going to pay their bills this winter
6403824 we are extremely concerned that the one in three pensioner households likely to be living in fuel poverty by the end of the year will feel forced to cut back on essential food or fuel the government must seize control of this escalating crisis and take immediate action to ease the pressure on millions of households
6403825 the mortgage market is clearly in a period of decline across the uk as a result of the shortage of mortgage funding and softening borrower demand but the slowdown is less pronounced in scotland

6403889 because it was devoted to the actual tactics as the cia people were demanding a golden shield that would protect them from later prosecutions and only a memo approving specific tactics could do that
6403890 he read and was horrified by torture memos after he was put in charge of the olc and long before he wrote the transfer memo he is convicted out of his own mouth
6403891 his goldsmiths admission that he read the second still secret memo that detailed specific interrogation techniques being used by the cia makes it flatly impossible that he did not know or suspect what was going on when he wrote the transfer memo
6403892 was used to facilitate the ghost detainee program in which various prisoners were hidden from the international red cross so that nobody would learn that they were prisoners
6403893 and contrary to the geneva conventions i gather their status health and whereabouts were not disclosed to their families
6403894 by not formally accusing them in any judicial way we could according to goldsmith transfer them out of iraq because formally they were not yet accused persons although in fact our government had already accused and convicted them every way but sideways this is true dissembling this is true reliance on minimal form over gigantic substance and this is exactly what jack goldsmith did in his memo of march 19 2004
6403895 until the time came to garner publicity in september 2007 for his new book
6403896 goldsmith was an enabler of evil including evil and crime justified by the tortured rationalizations of lawyers who set out to provide legal cover for torture for cruelly inhuman conduct and other horrors
6403897 whether lawyers in order to justify and provide a basis for supporting vicious and illegal actions of the government are free to assert the most outlandish arguments in favor of these actions are free to invent astonishing even evil arguments in favor of the positions are free to facilitate the governments evil actions and not to counsel against the positions even though the positions and actions are in violation of domestic criminal laws in violation of international law contrary to the american constitutional system and taken without consideration of the traditions and values of this country
6403898 gravely illegal conduct in this way would be subject to disbarment subject to criminal prosecution and disqualified from being on any respectable law school faculty
6403899 an enemy of the people the unending battle against conventional wisdom
6403900 we wanted to take more time as a family to figure it all out

6403914 i stephanie tubbs jones a representative from ohio and ms boxer a senator from california object to the counting of the electoral votes of the state of ohio on the ground that they were not under all of the known circumstances regularly given
6403915 i thank god that i have a senator joining me in this objection
6403916 while some have called our cause foolish i can assure you that my parents mary and andrew tubbs did not raise any fools and as a lawyer former judge and prosecutor i am duty bound to follow the law and apply the law to the facts as i find them
6403917 it is on behalf of those millions of americans who believe in and value our democratic process and the right to vote that i put forth this objection today
6403918 this objection does not have at its root the hope or even the hint of overturning or challenging the victory of the president but it is a necessary timely and appropriate opportunity to review and remedy the most precious process in our democracy
6403919 i raise this objection neither to put the nation in the turmoil of a proposed overturned election nor to provide cannon fodder or partisan demagoguery for my fellow republican members of congress
6403920 i raise this objection because i am convinced that we as a body must conduct a formal and legitimate debate about election irregularities i raise this objection to debate the process and protect the integrity of the true will of the people
6403921 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6403922 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6403923 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate

6403956 as it is if you run a business using your mac then you cannot use mobileme because it transmits data insecurely
6403957 i wouldnt say that its a critical issue or something thats a reason not to use the service but its definitely something that should be addressed

6403966 weve seen these isolated reports about people having connectivity issues with 3g and edge and frankly i have those issues on a variety of phones
6403967 we have already made many improvements to mobileme but we still have many more to make
6403968 we know that mobilemes launch has not been our finest hour
6403969 the fact is that the private system exists and like it or not it is here to stay
6403970 we need to accommodate it in order for the public system to prosper
6403971 we have one of the most costly and least efficient health systems of any industrialized country
6403972 its not for everyone its not all doctors who will go to the private side thats for sure and its not feasible everywhere
6403973 does it make sense in the face of a shortage of operating rooms to ban surgeons who provide 90 per cent of their services in a hospital from performing five to 10 per cent of their surgeries in a private clinic
6403974 i totally agree with dr ouellet that we need to do better but most of my patients cant afford to go to dr ouellets clinics
6403975 were going to have to find solutions that benefit everyone and not just people who can afford to pay
6403976 theres just no market outside of major cities for this kind of thing
6403977 they knew what brian day was doing they knew what im doing and they voted for us
6403978 weve always been highly in favour of a publicly funded system but i think we as an organization certainly have reached the stage where we realize there have to be alternatives because the system is not working
6403979 the wait times are totally unacceptable and there are shortages across the country especially in newfoundland the cracks are starting to show

6403983 we were very confident that zimbabwe would ratify their earlier decision to withdraw but there is always that element of doubt
6403984 it is a big relief too the key thing is that we need to keep competing in these world events to keep reinforcing that we are up there with the worlds elite we need to keep playing them and will hopefully get a result against one of them sometime
6403985 for our guys it is another big event to look forward to next year
6403986 along with facing australia and the world cup qualifying tournament next year is building into a really big one for us this decision gives us another chance to play against test nations it is a big big boost
6403987 it is a great piece of news to get at the end of the season and we are really looking forward to it
6403988 it is exciting challenging thats for sure but at the same time there is lots of good cricket there for us to aim for
6403989 we cant wait for that opportunity by qualifying for world cups and the like you do get extra funding and that helps to pay for the programmes for players this will come in handy in terms of helping to professionalise some of the players
6403990 this sort of event is the reason why we do what we do all the players who were involved in last years world cup and the twenty20 had a great time really enjoyed the experience of facing the best teams in the world playing against world class opposition is the chance to challenge ourselves and really improve our own performances
6403991 the problems facing this economy are pretty easy to identify energy prices are high and rising writing checks doesnt do anything to solve that problem

6404063 we received a call from the director of the zoo one of his leopards was having trouble giving birth to her young
6404064 so we sent a team to the zoo it became clear the cat had an obstruction from a dead fetus the cat was absolutely in a bad way so they essentially gave the care that was required
6404065 weak movements of her chest were the only sign that she was still alive
6404066 an animal in this condition is a poor candidate for surgery but in julies case there was no option or she would have died from toxaemia within 24 hours
6404067 without the intervention of the team that cat would have died and that would have been a crying shame

6404075 sometimes its hard for the cuban people to believe how difficult it is to build a team after so many defections and only one year before the olympics
6404076 i can still drop by the fortune gym and the wild card after rich and i finish
6404077 its going to be a battle of wills between the two of us
6404078 one of the reasons i love the sport the risk of getting in there and winning it all or losing it all is what makes boxing special and its valuable experiences like that which make me a better fighter
6404079 id never been cut before i fought czar amonsot and that was a valuable experience id never lost or been stopped before fighting casamayor i grew from both fights
6404080 i dont know how much longer im going to box but when i retire i dont want to have any regrets
6404081 i want to say ive done all i set out to do in this sport before i die so i dont want any easy fights i like taking the hard road
6404082 a lot of people underestimate casamayor as a fighter not a boxer or a ring artist but as a fighter he can box but hell fight
6404083 but it was a terrific fight for the fans and i think the fight with marquez can be a good one depending on which version of marquez shows up
6404084 i think marquez will bring a mixture of both styles but i dont think the winner of the fight can rely just on counter punching my guys a counter puncher and if we have two counter punchers we have no fight so im going to make sure my guy comes to fight
6404085 it was a 12 round fight that wound up being a draw
6404086 quarry dropped patterson twice in the second round and patterson came back and put quarry down in the seventh the knockdowns were more of the flash variety but it was a good fight one i thought patterson out boxed quarry in the majority of rounds but jerry got the hometown edge in scoring
6404087 they fought again a few months later this time at the olympic and i was at that fight too quarry won a close decision in a bout that was part of the wbas tournament to find a successor to muhammad ali
6404088 patterson was the heavyweight champ when i was a kid so he became my hero
6404089 i was on cloud 9 when he won and i was heart broken when he lost i cried when he was knocked out by ingemar johansson i left a cub scout meeting to listen to the rematch on the radio
6404090 it was the closed circuit broadcast of his rematch with liston
6404091 july 22nd 1963 it was at the olympic they had four big screens in a square hanging from the ceiling and the place was packed
6404092 what i remember of that broadcast was that there were no other fights that they showed there were no features on the main event or anything like that the broadcast began with commentators introducing the fight while the camera focused on the area where patterson would walk out of his dressing room and two minutes after the broadcast started patterson emerged from his dressing room
6404093 i remember at age six or seven my father leaving the house to watch the closed circuit of carmen basilios challenge to ray robinson
6404094 before he left my dad explained that carmen was the welterweight champ challenging the middleweight champ and that he was italian like us so he was going to watch the fight with his friends so he could cheer for basilio
6404095 i listened to the radio broadcast that night and thats when i got interested in boxing not long after that fight i watched my first fight on tv the first archie moore yvon durell fight
6404096 my dad was going absolutely berserk during all those knockdowns and since i was his son i did the same thing i was jumping out of my seat and screaming too
6404097 dad had a stack of the ring and the police gazette magazines dating back to the 30s that was taller than me i read them all and became completely obsessed with boxing im steeped in boxing i spent my summers reading those magazines and learning about the history of this great sport
6404098 i set up a speed bag in our garage and invited neighborhood kids to come over and put on the gloves for backyard boxing that my dad supervised
6404099 theres a goofy senior year picture i took with my friends in the 67 yearbook at norte dame where im wearing boxing gloves a robe and trunks with a sign hung around my neck that read rich muhammad marotta next heavyweight champ
6404100 throughout high school and even college i stayed loyal to floyd patterson he was my guy in college other guys had pin ups of raquel welch and other sex symbols on their walls but i had posters of patterson on mine
6404101 two weeks before his first fight with quarry i got to watch patterson train at the hacienda hotel in el segundo boy that was a thrill the whole training camp was open to the public after he was done with all his training hed speak to the crowd and then hed do autographs every day i got in line to get an autograph he was so nice
6404102 i was writing copy for the sports anchors on kfwb am an all news station
6404103 it was my first real job and i was still in college but they let me do interviews if i wanted so i got a chance to interview patterson before his second fight with ali it was such a thrill just to do a phone interview with him
6404104 alan malamud was my color man this was before they had a weekly show before sean ogrady and al albert it was a bruce curry fight and it took place at the showboat hotel in las vegas but i cant remember who he fought
6404105 i sporadically did fights from irvine in the mid 80s
6404106 like the showboat fights they were promoted by don chargin but televised by a small network that was owned by donny osmond i saw genaro hernandez come up on those shows and my color guy was jerry quarry and he was good
6404107 i started out filling in for ruben castillo in 92 and soon became a regular
6404108 i was lucky enough to call the action on some terrific fighters like barrera marquez chiquita gonzalez 2 sharp johnson and israel vazquez
6404109 the last fight chiquita gonzalez had vs saman sorjaturong was dramatic
6404110 and i called the barrera mckinney fight for hbos international broadcast that was pretty darn good too
6404111 ezzra sellers vs alex stewart a fight i called with barry tompkins on fox sports net in kansas city was awesome it had seven knockdowns in three rounds
6404112 because from the first round it started out with non stop exchanges and intensity and it built on that from every round until the 10th round which sets it apart from all the other candidates for the all time best fight in my opinion
6404113 some boxing fans are of the opinion that i am over the hill well i want to show to them that i am not boxing is still in me and i will show the public that andrew sixhead lewis has what it takes to become a world champion again
6404114 many feel that after i lost my world title to ricardo mayorga followed by an unsuccessful attempt at world boxing organization wbo antonio margaritos welterweight title my days in the ring were numbered
6404115 but i am still crafty and skillful and when i step into the ring with eastman on october 5th at the national stadium i will be looking for a victory as i always do i still possess my qualities that made me a world champion such as skill and endurance and with god on my side i am ready to go out there and take him on and come away the victor
6404116 after suffering that defeat to dalton i went and recollected my thoughts to see where i went wrong after doing such and being given the opportunity to fight him again i had to prove not only to him or my fans but also myself that i am superior to him and that will also be the scenario when i face eastman
6404117 he eastman is a good fighter and i give him a lot of credit even though he has never won a world title i dont underestimate any of my opponents and it would be the same when i face him
6404118 however having seen him in action against dalton via television i think it was a sluggish encounter he was not near his best and i wish for him to be at his best when he faces me as it gives me an added boost when i face an opponent who is at his best and is giving his best
6404119 i would love to face raul frank who has been avoiding me like a plague or dreaded disease he has even refused to spar with me in the gym in new york and i want to take this opportunity to challenge him all he has to do is come out of his shell and put his name on the dotted line so we can get it on
6404120 special thanks to my trainers lennox daniels maurice bizzy boyce and former national amateur heavyweight champion terrence poole and all the sparring partners who have been helping with my preparations for this fight
6404121 believes that the right of law abiding citizens to keep and bear arms is a fundamental individual constitutional right gun control is a proven failure in fighting crime law abiding citizens should not be asked to give up their rights because of criminals criminals who ignore gun control laws anyway
6404122 as a general principle i believe that the constitution confers an individual the right to bear arms i have no intention of taking away folks guns
6404123 i truly believe the kid had all the talent in the world to be a world champion

6404131 the amateur boxing association aba choosing to yesterday wednesday issue billy joe saunders with a suspension relating to an incident which happened months before the beijing olympic games is extremely disappointing
6404132 releasing such allegations to the media at this time could prove detrimental to the critical preparations of the other three boxers who will be contesting to reach the final of the boxing competition tomorrow friday
6404133 we are frustrated that our athletes and the boxing coaching team will have to deal with this added pressure and distraction at this point in the games nobody involved with boxing should be distracting the team at this time
6404134 my focus over the next 48 hours is to prepare my three boxers for their semi final bouts tomorrow friday
6404135 the allegations made in the media about the conduct of athletes on the british boxing programme are on the whole unfounded
6404136 i feel extremely disillusioned that i have learnt of the suspension of one of my boxers from the media track this topic

6404143 i recognised that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
6404144 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
6404145 i think that was something the press elaborated on that didnt happen he didnt turn i shot him in the back
6404146 and i said wouldnt it be something if i killed this individual i would become famous i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
6404147 i perceived him at the time and wrongly judged him to be a phoney here he is at this ritzy building and he had been singing of love and other things at that time it angered me
6404148 i was deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life in the air crash at barajas airport in madrid the news of which has shocked us all

6404154 now in its third year in greenville the greenville hospital system usa cycling professional road and time trial championships will once again showcase the depth of talent the united states peloton has at the pro level

6404167 this is a momentous decision the bush administration committed crimes against binyam mohamed the british government may have been bushs poodle but the british courts remain bulldogs when it comes to human rights compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered the next step is for the british government to demand an end to the charade against him in guant namo bay and return him home to britain
6404168 just hang out at georgetown write some articles and wait for the democrats to take back the white house
6404169 it might have been thought self evident that the provision of information as to the whereabouts of a person in custody would cause no particular difficulty given that it is a basic and long established value in any democracy that the location of those in custody is made known to the detainees family and those representing him in these circumstances to leave the issue of disclosure to the processes of the military commission at some future time would be to deny mr mohamed a real chance of providing support to a limited part of his account and other essential assistance to his defence to deny him this at this time would be to deny him the opportunity of timely justice in respect of the charges against him a principle dating back to at least the time of the magna carta and which is so basic a part of our common law and of democratic values

6404172 this is a very important case and our funding of it underscores legal aids continuing commitment to ensuring fair access to justice for all it is a further demonstration of legal aids track record in funding precedent setting cases
6404173 im a military attorney and ive been appointed to represent you
6404174 i can understand if you dont trust me right now i work for the same people who are holding you here
6404175 how can i plead guilty if i dont know what ive done
6404176 these military commissions are presidential policy and sooner or later the president is going to change a different president may want to pursue a different foreign policy if you plead guilty to something no president is going to argue for your release on the other hand if you plead not guilty theres a very real possibility that someone in the future may release you
6404177 the only way to get you these rights is to sue the bush administration
6404178 det er min helt klare opfattelse at det er ulovligt

6404180 irregular warfare the nonkinetic solutions some whole of government approaches but particularly looking at the notion of information dominance in the battle space and things that we can do with our interagency partners to achieve effects without necessarily totally leaning on
6404181 this is a very long term strategy that we must be engaged in and it runs the gamut from just counter terrorism to counter crime to however you want to look at it
6404182 threads of violent actors that range across the scope of terrorist actors to just international organized criminals to i think narco terrorists or drug traders and then in some cases just basic gangs thieves and thugs that can come together and represent a very formidable threat to our region for a number of reasons
6404183 these are not necessarily you know standing organized armies that wear uniforms like we all envision warfare to be
6404184 it takes a different kind of tactic in terms of countering disrupting and defeating this kind of threat
6404185 if were going to establish a security line of operation in afghanistan then obviously from that you dont necessarily get security if you cant resolve the economic and agricultural conundrum of what is the money maker well its the poppy product so a strategy has got to deal with that
6404186 what do we do the military does not necessarily do that but what can we do to establish desired strategic objectives that the interagency could step up to with maybe department of agriculture us agency for international development and state department to do that what can nato do to also help influence that
6404187 afghanistan is a different battle space than iraq so the lessons of iraq may or may not work in afghanistan
6404188 the situation is much different the people are much different the dynamics are much different so still a lot of work to be done in afghanistan
6404189 long term endeavor to engage at a strategic level to do those things across all of the many areas of need that would need to be done

6404194 but if he is taking something written by somebody else and putting it together as some sort of compilation to create the book then some different inferences might flow
6404195 theres a pretty widespread belief that this is an antiquated system
6404196 its analogous to saying lets take a class of high school kids who have never held a basketball give them 30 hours in the classroom and six hours hands on and say now we have taught you to play basketball
6404197 there are a number of other states that have cut their programs and are regretting it
6404198 i think a law needs to be passed that the parents have to log a certain number of hours driving with their children
6404199 i was surprised when i first heard that now ive just accepted that its not worth much
6404200 i think a lot of classroom instruction was common sense but we kind of needed o do it to pass the test
6404201 the book work gives you the set guidelines but its not the same as going out and experiencing it first hand
6404202 we are talking abut a 100 000 piece of equipment with three gas plasma screens
6404203 the one we have is geared for public safety officers but i think a lot of the same driving simulation could be used for driving in general

6404210 no lay person should make his or her own interpretation of what may have happened simply by looking at the medical records without knowing the circumstances and other important information that only the examining medical practitioner may be privy to
6404211 this is in direct breach of patient confidentiality and is liable to be used for reasons unacceptable to the medical profession
6404212 it is simply unacceptable for members of the community to subject our fire crews to abuse at the scene of an incident where they are trying to help
6404213 to enter a fire and rescue service vehicle and carelessly manoeuvre it into other vehicles shows a total lack of respect for the hard work of the emergency services
6404214 this womans actions are unbelievable and totally unacceptable and we will not tolerate this kind of behaviour
6404215 gathering comprehensive data about the dead from civilians is a time consuming task
6404216 we have to cross check data and check that people are not misidentified or miscounted
6404217 we have to make sure there is no double counting if a body is moved we have to be careful not to count it twice maybe it is counted once in the village itself and then it could be counted again in the city morgue
6404218 to get really accurate figures you would really have to go to every single village
6404219 we do take allegations of arrests of people missing or reported dead we can also offer our services to the authorities for the transfer of mortal remains
6404220 all the work we do is gathering confidential information which we share with the authorities with the aim of finding out the location of loved ones for the civilian population
6404221 there has been a lot of controversy about the russian figures
6404222 when that figure came out of 1 500 dead it wasnt very helpful it didnt provide any sourcing or methodology there were no details about how the figure was calculated we certainly cant confirm it
6404223 the problem here is that when russia puts out a figure like that it does two things it distracts attention from where there are violations and from the real scale of what is happening
6404224 if you have a military objective then the grad rocket is not a targeted weapon civilians are going to get hit and that is exactly what happened and happened on a significant scale the proximity was such that it was indiscriminate
6404225 the rule is that disproportionate attacks are prohibited in other words if you have your eye on a military target and there is likely to be civilian damage excessive in relation to the expected military gain you dont fire
6404226 we have numerous stories of ossetian forces roving around ethnic georgian villages running around looting homes torching them
6404227 we are looking into other accounts of violence of people being robbed at gunpoint these are areas that russian forces have control over it is their responsibility to protect them
6404228 consider the following scenario you have a computer that is running windows server 2008 or windows vista service pack 1 the computer has a peripheral component interconnect pci express interface you have at least one pci express card that does not fully support active state power management aspm inserted you restart the computer in this scenario an internal error may occur during restart for example a cpu ierr error may occur additionally the system may stop responding

6404480 right now hes playing at a level that is consistent and thats what were looking for
6404481 we moved harris from the open free safety to the tight strong safety and whats happened there is he sees that the game is a lot faster in that area
6404482 so his reads are a lot different but hes capable of doing that robinson said the changes in the depth chart are not etched in stone
6404483 that could be washington thats going back in there ok
6404484 it could be harris back at open safety weve got to find continuity back there in the back end harris made the move to strong safety at halftime of the teams last scrimmage and has been teaming with ford in the starting lineup the past few days
6404485 the more you know on the defense the more opportunity you have to go in on the field
6404486 ill learn three spots robinson mentioned that the safeties had been missing too many tackles through the opening portion of camp
6404487 we need physical people on the field but once again its not just about being physical its about being smart too
6404488 whats happening with us right now is were kind of escalating our freshmen up the ranks to be those no 1 guys but they havent had the same reps those guys we had in the spring have
6404489 so its a matter of do you live with the growing pains and how long do you do that before you feel more comfortable with possibly going back to that next guy if he shows us he wants to be that type of football player a physical smart tough football player
6404490 dennis johnson is the one young back thats gotten a lot of reps here lately and has really done some good things
6404491 i think we see a lot out of him hes starting to learn the offense better
6404492 hes going to play and play a lot and play early
6404493 today it wasnt our voices i was hearing it was the players voices and lot of that has to do with responsibility
6404494 you saw the energy that occurs when you do start getting success
6404495 but at least now were starting to play faster to the ball
6404496 the tight ends did a pretty good job but they can play better
6404497 they need to pick up their game and start playing better williams said he understands the tight ends can play at a higher level
6404498 weve had a long hard camp and i think fatigue is really getting to us now but thats just something that happens in the fourth quarter and we need to overcome and step up if they want us to be the playmakers like they want us to be
6404499 n s temos que reverter essa situa o de brigar contra o rebaixamento no segundo turno nossa equipe tem jogadores de qualidade com totais condi es de conseguir fazer uma boa campanha

6404503 hes really serious he wants to get better hes always looking for what can i do coach how can i get better give me more drills so its going to end up working out for him
6404504 hes going to be a great player for us we just need it to happen at a fast pace and a fast rate
6404505 weve got a game in a few days and if hes actually going to run out there and play theres going to be a lot of people in that stadium screaming and you cant be silent
6404506 you have to bark it out you have to really scream it out and thats what hes struggling with right now
6404507 how to play the position how to put touch on the ball how to drive the ball in when to throw the ball over the defenders head when to hold it for a second and throw it between the defenders
6404508 i just knew that i had to come in with a great attitude and work hard
6404509 now im getting a little more reps and i think thats a good thing i think im going to keep progressing as long as im getting reps
6404510 we want to see the growth and the development see whos learning
6404511 we always evaluate how they are in the meetings how they act how they present themselves because the quarterback is the face of the program and if something were to happen to casey right now that person would be the face of the program
6404512 when that snap comes up you have to be moving
6404513 you cant be questioning yourself and wondering if youre going to get the snap because youre playing from behind as soon as the ball is snapped
6404514 if all of a sudden we make those position changes
6404515 and we change our depth chart youd like to think that the guy thats moved from a one to two is going to bristle up and try to compete and come back and be a one
6404516 we didnt feel like hed been playing up to his consistency
6404517 so we had to make that move to hopefully sit down there and burn a fire underneath his butt
6404518 right now hes playing at a level that is consistent
6404519 im pretty much guard right now but they still have got me working on some center stuff
6404520 after practice and before practice theyve got me doing snaps and working on my calls
6404521 knowing center helps you know both guard positions because you pretty well have got to tell them what to do
6404522 they were good the first few days of practice and they started getting bad
6404523 dennis johnson is the one thats gotten a lot of reps here lately and has really done some good things
6404524 i told myself i wasnt going to do a lot of talking just playing
6404525 arkansas has always had good backs and i dont want there to be any drop off
6404526 i like running between the tackles but 20 25 times a game is going to wear down my body
6404527 getting the ball in space and using my quickness and instincts is going to be where im most successful
6404528 were not going to run into stacked boxes like last year
6404529 ive never played a full college game so im not sure how im going to hold up
6404530 i just know that when my numbers called im running it as hard as i can
6404531 we cut a lot last year but coach bobby petrinos used to having big backs and doing a lot of stand up blocking
6404532 i think everyone knows now that its going to take more than two
6404533 with the younger backs knowing that their opportunity is coming soon they work harder
6404534 i dont think its any secret were going to have to be tailback by committee
6404535 we dont have that guy who can pound it 30 times a game
6404536 deanthonys been on the sidelines and chips been banged up although he did some stuff wednesday
6404537 dennis johnson is the one whos been getting a lot of reps lately and hes doing some really good things
6404538 shes having a blast right now because she knows shes playing well
6404539 i think thats the sentiment on the team this year that they have something to prove
6404540 she is an incredibly intense young lady and youll hear her out on the field
6404541 she has no problems giving directions to the younger players and older players
6404542 the fact that she gets that kind of respect is because she earns it

6404552 how are you today there was also a story going around in alabama about the promotion coca cola was having that was supposed to be life size cutouts of nick saban tommy tuberville and houston nutt drinking from a bottle
6404553 theyre trying to get us ready for game situations because obviously theyre not going to be able to get on the field with us and help us out on some plays
6404554 theyre trying to get us to think on our own and realize that the game is coming around here in 10 nine days
6404555 but the thing is i get to see the whole picture
6404556 ive done both but my favorite has always been on the sideline
6404557 but im going to do whats best for this football team and thats be upstairs
6404558 heralded tight ends garner criticism arkansas tight ends namely d j williams were a primary target and succeeded with flying colors in the spring but offensive coordinator paul petrino voiced a rare displeasure with the unit tuesday after practice
6404559 tight ends did pretty good but they can play better
6404560 they need to pick up their game and start playing better
6404561 weve had a long hard camp and i think fatigue is really getting to us now but thats just something that happens in the fourth quarter and we need to overcome and step up if the coaches want us to be the playmakers like they want us to be
6404562 as the hog ball turns the strange tale of patrick beverley at the university of arkansas has twisted and turned as much as a story arc in a soap opera

6404564 i violated ncaa rules and what happened went over the coaches heads
6404565 im going overseas for a year and hopefully ill be able to come back and get picked in the draft
6404566 this was hard because i was working out with the team every day and getting ready for the season
6404567 really for me my focus is on can i go to school somewhere
6404568 i have thought about what itd be like overseas but its not like i am focused on that yet
6404569 but i understand that it just might not work out that way so i need to have a backup plan

6404576 when youre in last place with zero point after two rounds thats what i call a crisis
6404577 we lost in the first match because of two individual errors
6404578 while child welfare services had improved an immigration removal centre can never be a suitable place for children and we were dismayed to find cases of disabled children being detained and some children spending large amounts of time incarcerated
6404579 any period of detention can be detrimental to children and their families but the impact of lengthy detention is particularly extreme
6404580 which was not surprising given the sometimes traumatic circumstances in which many had initially been detained
6404581 we found examples in the recent past of children with disabilities who ought not to have been detained
6404582 yarls wood is to be congratulated on sustaining reasonable performance in many areas despite the upheavals of the change of management and reduction in staff numbers
6404583 the seamless shift gearbox will really be our last development for 2008 and we will now shift our focus to 2009 in the second part of the year
6404584 there will however still be opportunities up for grabs and we need to look to maximise them now really what force india has proved is that we look competitive in race conditions and under the right circumstances can pick up points if the chances come our way weve performed well on street courses too and with two in the final part this could be a good opportunity for us we need to look for a 100 reliability rate to ensure that whenever these chances come our way we are really able to take advantage
6404585 although 2009 is a big opportunity there are still points up for grabs this year
6404586 weve got some good potential chances coming up and if we take our eye off the ball we could miss out on getting some good finishes that said work for 2009 will step up immensely towards the end of the season so we can make sure we are ready
6404587 are there enough of these confident nonconformists out there for us
6404588 die mannschaft hat gute arbeit geleistet das war nicht leicht gegen einen gegner von so hoher qualit t mit dem ergebnis bin ich zufrieden die spieler brauchen positive ergebnisse und eine positive atmosph re
6404589 wir haben viele fehler im spiel gemacht zum beispiel zu oft lange p sse gespielt aber daran k nnen wir arbeiten beim n chsten treffen haben wir mehr zeit
6404590 vor dem spiel gegen frankreich haben wir mehr zeit um uns mit dem gegner zu besch ftigen
6404591 gegen italien pressing zu spielen und druck zu machen ist schwer ich habe schon bessere mannschaften in einem tiefen block spielen sehen

6404595 wir haben schon mit spielern und dem spielerrat geredet und keine negativen ger usche mitbekommen die spieler m ssen auch selbst damit klarkommen
6404596 ich sch tze meine spieler niemals ber die zeitungen ein
6404597 au erdem habe ich im spiel coaching gemacht und das ist eine andere arbeit in den n chsten tagen werde ich das spiel genau analysieren
6404598 ich wei noch nicht ob ich mir am sonntag das derby anschauen werde ich bin nach diesen tagen ein bisschen m de muss jetzt einmal unser spiel analysieren und dann schauen wie wir bei unserem n chsten treffen arbeiten werden

6404622 all things are ultimately the result of a virus from the first flicker of life on earth to the battle against disease in the middle ages to the present day bigfoot thought process where human beings perpetrate a scam each one of these was generated by a microscopic virus
6404623 ultimately no one is really responsible for anything because tiny viruses inhabit all life forms giving us energy disease and bad tv channel changing habits you think putin invaded the republic of georgia just because he lusts for power and control nope reports say he had a slight fever the night before the invasion and when he got up that morning he said lets take georgias oil pipeline it should be ours anyhow thats how these viruses work
6404624 mit is able to make a virus generate electricity in a controlled environment and the battery theyre building will be terrific but the notion that a virus made putin do what he did in georgia or that a virus made the guys do the bigfoot hoax is bunk
6404625 people are responsible for their own behavior and need to be held accountable the mit folks should be rewarded and putin and the bigfoot assholes should be shot or something like that im not usually in favor of violence but ive got a cold and im feeling kind of crabby maybe a virus really is responsible for some behaviors
6404626 were talking about a simple inexpensive and environmentally better way of generating a microbattery
6404627 as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot

6404630 i love shutting off oil to the ukraine and ribbing them about the price of energy and get a kick out of doing it to western europe too the silly georgians were working their way around me with their oil pipeline but not anymore its a good joke on them and the u s who helped finance it because now its mine i think everybody is enjoying a good chuckle over this one at least all of us here at putin castle
6404631 id like to see my husband for more than a day

6404635 im not done and i hope misty isnt done yet either

6404859 i remember her being on the corner in washington since i was a little boy able to walk she played gospel music and what she called truth songs she considered her ministry to be her street corner spot

6404919 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6404920 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6404921 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

6404926 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6404927 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6404928 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6404929 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6404930 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6404931 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6404932 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6404933 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6404934 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6404935 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6404936 who are open to doing something on the production side
6404937 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6404938 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6404939 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6404940 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6404941 theyre looking to make more putts get a little confidence

6404944 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6404945 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6404946 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6404947 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6404948 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6404949 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6404950 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6404951 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6404952 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6404953 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6404954 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6404955 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6404956 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6404957 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6404958 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6404959 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6404960 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6404961 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6404962 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6404963 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6404964 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6404965 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6404966 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6404967 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6404968 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6404969 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6404970 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6404971 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6404972 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6404973 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6404974 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6404975 weve seen these isolated reports about people having connectivity issues with 3g and edge and frankly i have those issues on a variety of phones
6404976 we have already made many improvements to mobileme but we still have many more to make
6404977 we know that mobilemes launch has not been our finest hour
6404978 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6404979 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

6404986 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6404987 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6404988 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6404989 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6404990 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6404991 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6404992 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6404993 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6404994 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6404995 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6404996 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6404997 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6404998 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6404999 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6405000 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6405001 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6405002 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6405003 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6405004 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6405005 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6405006 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6405007 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6405008 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6405009 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6405010 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6405011 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6405012 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6405013 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

6405024 i threw him out and changed the locks on the doors but my wife gave him the keys to get back in
6405025 when i was a child i loved to go to a park where there was a willow tree and be underneath it i always felt safe there and i want my room to be a safe place for the children i want them to feel safe when they are there with me
6405026 the thing that makes me the happiest is the children i just love being with them
6405027 its different than it was a few years ago when we didnt stick so much to the academics now standards are becoming higher for children before they go into kindergarten therefore we are teaching the academics like counting and letter recognition and some of mine are even putting together words
6405028 but its all done in a fun way we count steps and things like that its all done in play its not that they have to sit down and do it its something they want to do
6405029 one may say this is not remarkable but considering the fact they are 90 and 96 it is truly remarkable
6405030 i volunteered at my sons school when he was in grade school and i enjoyed it so much that i decided that i could do a little more good if i went to school and got into the education field myself
6405031 i became interested in the theories of early childhood education i attended central state university and graduated from clark state community college with an associate in early childhood education
6405032 if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6405033 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist
6405034 aaron didnt do anything wrong he did what i did he used the guard to go to ou
6405035 christian strong duty values heart country proud blah blah blah
6405036 and there are too many air national guardsmen that have served for him to do that he is not one of them
6405037 right after sept 11 things settled down and deployments were starting to come down
6405038 we had received a requirement to send a team to kuwait and all of a sudden aaron submits a conscientious objector packet i believe it was a subterfuge to keep from going to the desert cause he was on the list
6405039 i also did everything i was asked to do and went everywhere i was asked to go i sought the co status mainly because of my christian principles
6405040 and i had serious questions about whether or not i could take someones life
6405041 youre not deployed while the request is being acted on
6405042 so until its either approved or disapproved the co application he was saying he cant pick up a weapon to defend this country he sat in an administrative role at will rogers while other people filled in for him and went to the desert
6405043 honestly it never really entered my mind when i signed up for the service that i might have to take another persons life thats why it was such a tough decision i did it to protect the guys i was with
6405044 i did a brief investigation found out what he was doing and submitted the information to the judge advocate general jag
6405045 when youre in a certain status you have to pay for your meals
6405046 but he was going over and eating and not paying for his meals which constitutes fraud
6405047 it was over one meal and he placed me in cuffs and said he was charging me with fraud people were shocked they were completely surprised
6405048 he was involuntarily mobilized and deployed stateside under operation noble eagle which was only stateside i was deployed with him at this time while deployed he did everything he could think of to get home after he found that there was a chance we could be forward deployed overseas
6405049 he was required to pay for meals he ate at the base dining facility
6405050 he was investigated and it was found that even after being told this he still ate there without paying for those meals
6405051 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
6405052 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine
6405053 well you guys did it so we get to do it
6405054 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
6405055 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine
6405056 well you guys did it so we get to do it
6405057 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6405058 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6405059 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them

6405255 the last time we played australia in perth they made it really tough for us at the breakdown but weve put a lot of work into the breakdown this week and i think itll pay off
6405256 i think we just need to be more effective at the breakdown and more precise
6405257 at times weve had numbers there and not taken the guys away its definitely an area we need to improve because australia have got fantastic fetchers as well
6405258 happiness is like peeing in your pants everyone can see it but only you can feel the warmth
6405259 because he has been assessed to be a threat to the security of iraq and coalition forces
6405260 if there are legitimate issues about him or any other journalist lets have them aired openly and tested if there are none let them pursue their profession free from intimidation and fear
6405261 ali is part of our iraqi family his colleagues in london and baghdad are delighted hes been freed we now look to the american military authorities to offer evidence and an explanation for alis detention
6405262 in the future we will put more resources into the training and mentoring of the afghan army
6405263 there are now 60 000 in the afghan army i believe the figures will go up from 60 000 to 80 000 and then 120 000
6405264 i believe that in time the figure for the afghan army given the size of this country may need to be even higher than 120 000
6405265 the reality is that most schools are not strong in maths chemistry and physics before they can teach these subjects at primary level it needs to be ensured that teachers are excited about it they need to have some practical experience so they can talk with experience
6405266 i think that theres something systematically wrong at primary school level
6405267 people are not being motivated to study these subjects and theres a perception that theyre hard subjects pupils need to be incentivised in some way to enjoy them
6405268 theres a strong argument for funding at every education level but theres strong evidence that before eight years of age is a pivotal time to invest
6405269 there are measures being taken along these lines including project maths the radical new mathematics curriculum set to be introduced in primary schools however the rollout of each will take time
6405270 there are many people conducting very exciting phds if the unions will permit it why not offer them an attractive rate to come into classrooms and share some of their findings
6405271 to enlist those who have retired from the likes of to bring their experience into the classroom and bring these subjects to life as adjunct teachers
6405272 project maths is on its way in the long term and will revolutionise the way maths is taught but bonus points could be a short term fix
6405273 new courses for the sciences are also on the way but meanwhile science and maths training should be mandatory for every new teacher coming through teacher training college and current teachers should be incentivised to update their skills in there areas
6405274 the other thing in the department that is a joke is technology in schools it should be about creating 21st century learning in the classroom and embedding it into the curriculum like chalk or writing to ensure that it is part of every day
6405275 in the 80s or 90s bonus points were awarded for students doing the honours maths syllabus
6405276 while ireland is undoubtedly a poor performer in some respects such as the low take up of engineering at third level nevertheless it outperforms its european partners in terms of the total number studying science maths and computing as a percentage of all tertiary graduates
6405277 there is a good future out there with a growing number of jobs in diverse and interesting areas
6405278 we need people outside the industries with a high skill level who understand the research economy and its complexities
6405279 but we havent been able to show these opportunities enough to students deciding on careers
6405280 this initiative opens up possibilities for fraport as an airport operator and ground handling provider to apply its extensive know how actively and to help define standards within the framework of the cargo 2000 quality management system
6405281 oh yea well my car has been making a wierd noise
6405282 you can set russias recent invasion of georgia and israels concern over irans nuclear aspirations on the back burner not that these topics lack importance
6405283 the stage is not adequately set for the highly publicized ezekiel 38 and 39 russian iranian nuclear equipped consortia of nations to invade israel and then ezekiel 38 follows on its heels like a goliath shadow there are two distinct invasions of israel one building upon the other with both occurring sequentially in the middle east
6405284 indeed something is very near but it is not armageddon
6405285 we think theres enormous potential to use it as a messaging service at festivals like oxegen and electric picnic so friends can broadcast to each other which tent their favourite dj will be performing in for example
6405286 its a friendlier way of communicating rather than having an email newsletter that gets tied up in junk mail for firms it is a good way of building brand awareness and because you can only send 140 characters at a time you get concise bursts of information to people rather than too much
6405287 mobile operators in most of the world charge users to send updates
6405288 when you send one message to twitter and we send it to 10 followers you arent charged 10 times thats because weve been footing the bill when we launched our free sms service to the world we set the clock ticking as the service grew in popularity so too would the price
6405289 everyone understands that as a business twitter needs to make money
6405290 in the same way that people are happy that google does search ads they want twitter to make money because they are fans of the system
6405291 in one survey i read recently users were asked would they pay for the service some 50pc of people said they would pay for it because it is useful but would want a guarantee there would be no outages thats a potential captive audience of 600 000 and twitter and any mobile operator worth its salt would be mad to ignore it
6405292 i think its actually fantastic that twitter is looking seriously at its business model and saying it cant afford to handle the sms volumes its an opportunity that cant be ignored
6405293 personally i use it as a fire hose i dont have time to send one message at a time to my friends and colleagues but this way i can keep everyone up to date i also use it to share and get knowledge around 25pc of my tweets are hyperlinked to other sites i have about 1 700 followers and more of them read my tweets than my actual blog
6405294 effectively twitter allows me to gain knowledge at a faster rate than if i was just visiting websites or reading blogs
6405295 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body
6405296 his hands legs were amputated and his head was decapitated

6405303 their families are in the district the day before yesterday at noon they tried to assassinate me but i was able to call the police for help
6405304 they said they were just taking him for a few minutes for an investigation
6405305 but they never released him and we heard he might be buried behind the mosque
6405306 suddenly we are told there is a corpse behind the door in an instant the room is completely altered
6405307 why does everything have to become a huge argument with you man
6405308 because this is america dude and as long as i have my freedom of speech nobody is going to shut me up

6405310 the secretary came out and when she came out the guy was just speeding out of the cemetery driveway and thats when he collided with the deputys car and kept going along old stage road

6405333 its something we would all like to be using a lot more but its really just starting
6405334 i felt like maybe i could talk to both sides
6405335 certainly in a museum youd like to be on the forefront of new activity and computer imaging would be at the forefront of what to do
6405336 now i come along as a copyist i cant do the original in one motion because im not van gogh
6405337 so i strike the brush multiple times to mimic the art
6405338 i guess the easiest way to think about it is youre a detective at a murder scene you got to collect a lot of evidence but you dont really know which piece of evidence is the one that cracks it open for you
6405339 thats the job so to speak of the conservators of the museum
6405340 they try to add a whole bunch of other evidence and try to make a decision about authentication
6405341 were trying to understand the kind of creative process that the artist engaged in
6405342 were in the early days of what im expecting to be an important area for researchers
6405343 i love this place so maybe you should look within yourselves and find out the real issues that are bothering you cuz their is no way its this building
6405344 at this time i was doing four or five figures a year for tussauds and anthony hopkins was one of the people i met
6405345 sir anthony was quite happy with the finished product in all i met him five times once for the sitting which took two hours and the last time for the unveiling of his full size statue
6405346 this saturday morning me and my kids had him all to ourselves just at the time when he was making one of his most popular films remains of the day
6405347 the kids made cups of tea and took photos of him while we talked about everything under the sun from divorce to saving snowdonia from the rhododendrons something he was very passionate about
6405348 anthony hopkins is a lovely man and as far as i know my portrait of him is still on view in tussauds
6405349 much of the time what we used to do was hire a suite in a top hotel and whoever we were doing would bring their agents and managers along the whole entourage as with the case of gloria estefan while she was in england on a european tour
6405350 gloria was really nice she took a great interest and sat patiently for the two hours it was a full figure in glorias case there was also a young lady along whose job it was to take the more intimate measurements
6405351 yes i was asked to pose for a body double for ozzie but when i saw photographs of him stripped to the waist its seemed to be a bit of an insult he was in an awful shape dreadful
6405352 it was to be a full ozzy figure with a long indian style suit with a high collar and a leather waistcoat specially donated
6405353 it turned out that everyone thought i was steven spielberg but im afraid they still charged me in the shop
6405354 a couple of years later i got the job of sculpting spielberg
6405355 so what you see is the head of spielberg i sculpted but my figure wearing his clothes and his head on my body its in tussauds and one of the american exhibitions i think as well
6405356 i eventually did him for tussauds but it had to be from reference material
6405357 when it came round again i wanted to do it with a sitting it didnt happen but it could have done if tussauds had just gone back to mr connery and apologised for what happened as it was i just did him from photos
6405358 sir patrick did a sitting and he invited me and the kids down to his private observatory on the south coast
6405359 oh yes all sorts of things patrick used to say if i am not too busy or kept occupied i tend to fall asleep so if you see me nodding off just shout out and give me a cup of coffee
6405360 i saw madame tussauds advertise in the times for freelance portrait sculptors id been round the waxworks a few years before and wasnt all that impressed i thought i could do better in some cases
6405361 tussauds took me on for an exhibition in amsterdam where i was given a character from a painting by a dutch painter it was a quack doctor
6405362 when i was at bookwell dickie douglas was the best in our class at art dickie became a fine cricketer but i will always remember he did a nice painting of an autumnal scene which robert hodgsons dad put in the window of his newsagents shop on main street
6405363 as for me i was good with my hands but after passing my art exams i didnt have the courage to go out and be an artist i chickened out of being a real artist and went off to do teacher training instead
6405364 i suppose its a marriage of the mind with me having played a lot of sport its good eye to hand co ordination you have to allay that co ordination with sensitivity a little bit of creativity and some inspiration i spend my time watching people i go to art exhibitions and look at people rather than the pictures
6405365 i was first aware of him through another good runner harry jarrett who used to be in the scout group i helped to run with derek lewthwaite at egremont
6405366 he seems to be so self contained and for me its to do with the eyes joss has such a far seeing look hes wise hard working dedicated incredibly strong with an honest face someone of stature you can certainly trust this is how most people i hope will see him its one of the best things i have ever done
6405367 folly is often more cruel in the consequences than malice can be in the intent
6405368 ive started dating sharon stone and shes pretty good for 50

6405445 sta alla bravura del fotografo capire latleta rispettarne le esigenze in gara e lasciare che si esprima secondo la sua personalit nei momenti successivi
6405446 in s potrebbe anche essere un gesto simpatico un po guascone e canagliesco se venisse fatto con spontaneit e occasionalmente dagli atleti pi spiritosi
6405447 mette daccordo fotografi e atleti ma non i lettori che di vedere centinaia di premiazioni con centinaia dei atleti che simpaticamente mordono la medaglia ne hanno le tasche piene

6405449 there is no bigger myth within the nuclear energy than their claim that nuclear energy and commercial reactors are and environmentally friendly co2 source of electricity from the very beginning of the uranium fuel cycle the massive creation of and dumping of co2 into our environment begins as well as a trail of far deadly contaminants first you have to get the uranium out of the ground uranium mining is very equipment intensive and the large pieces of equipment use massive amounts of fossil fuels further it takes tons and tons of of ore containing trace amounts of uranium to get enough actual raw uranium to be of any use this means said materials have to be carted to processing plants again said transporting of such vast quantities of these raw start up materials burn up vast amounts of carbon based fuels adding to nuclear co2 contributions to global warming once the materials have been mined they then must be milled or crushed these milling operations are usually fairly close to the mines once the materials are crushed various impurities are removed creating vast amounts of waste and the end product of this segment of the processing creates what is known as yellowcake this yellow cake is then packaged into 55 gallon drums and is ready to be shipped again thus using even more fossil fuels depending on the country and enrichment means to be used the uranium trioxide goes through even more processing at a conversion plant at this point the materials are ready to be shipped again this time to a fuel fabrication facility factor in the building of the nuclear facilities and the vast amount of fossil fuels that will be burned in decommissioning and it is obvious who the major contributor to global warming really is it would be nice if this was the end of nuclear energys co2 contributions to the environment but it is not it would be nice if these co2 emissions were the only contaminants and contributions to global warming that nuclear reactors created but sadly it is but the tip of the iceberg the fuel rods as one example still have to be shipped to the reactor sites again additional fossil fuels being burned up and we have not seen one watt of electrical energy produced as of yet
6405450 higher risk of flooding in a warming world must be factored into plans for new nuclear power stations in the uk the met office has said rising sea levels stronger winds and more powerful storm surges caused by climate change would strongly affect nuclear plants traditionally built in remote coastal areas where cooling water is always at hand the met office study commissioned by nuclear power company british energy to assess the impacts of climate change on nuclear plants concluded that the stations would need better flood protection and coastal defences and would also need to be built further inland
6405451 dozens of nuclear power reactors around the world could be threatened by rising sea levels and violent storms nuclear power plants need plentiful water for cooling so are usually near the sea or on rivers all of the uks operational plants most of japans and many in the united states are on the coast with sea levels likely to rise for at least the next 1 000 years according to a united nations report to be published on friday bolstering the flood defences of the worlds many coastal reactors looks set to become a more costly and time consuming job one that could last for centuries nor are inland river cooled reactors invulnerable to global warming hot weather makes it difficult to keep them cool and operate safely the hotter it gets the more frequently they may have to close just when power demand is highest

6405463 ive been really nervous but orientation tuesday and meeting the teachers made me feel so much better i was ready
6405464 instead of the typical first day where they go in and sit and listen to the rules and get their books i wanted to do an activity
6405465 i was always the student getting in trouble on the first day and i thought how can i make this more interesting
6405466 it wasnt what i expected to be doing at all on the first day
6405467 i cant believe im saying this but i love school

6405490 the u s nuclear weapons program has sickened 36 500 americans and killed more than 4 000 the rocky mountain news has determined from government figures those numbers reflect only people who have been approved for government compensation they include people who mined uranium built bombs and breathed dust from bomb tests many of the bomb builders such as those at the rocky flats plant near denver have never applied for compensation or were rejected because they could not prove their work caused their illnesses congressional hearings are in the works to review allegations of unfairness and delays in the program for weapons workers more than 15 000 of the 36 500 are workers who made atomic weapons they were exposed to radiation and toxic chemicals that typically took years to trigger cancer or lung disease others were civilians living near the nevada test site during above ground nuclear tests soldiers and workers at test sites and uranium miners and millers who breathed in radioactive dust until 1972 when the government stopped buying uranium at least 4 000 of the 36 500 died this number reflects cases where survivors could be paid only if their relative died of the covered illness many more of the 36 500 likely also have died of the deadly diseases triggered by their work but in most of the compensation programs the government does not track deaths or cause of death so the true number who gave their lives to support the nuclear bomb program probably will never be known some were contaminated through accident or ignorance but government documents have revealed that officials at times risked the health of civilians soldiers and workers because they believed national security demanded it one early atomic energy commission director lewis strauss wrote to a civilian who had been downwind of atomic test fallout that the danger of fallout was a small sacrifice compared to the infinite greater evil of the use of nuclear bombs in war

6405540 before mbna there was a concern for years about the old decaying mill
6405541 in 1992 the town was struggling with what to do and the progress was very slow
6405542 mbna changed the landscape over night they moved so fast
6405543 mbna in coming in and developing facilities improved a lot of real estate significantly in town
6405544 most big national companies that come in would just hire national service companies to do the work for them
6405545 they hired locals to do things they made it a point to do business locally and they challenged local businesses and contractors to step it up 300 percent
6405546 i thought we needed a shot of that we were asked to achieve things we had never done before
6405547 before mbna came to our community belfast camden and rockland practically shut down for the winter
6405548 people now look at belfast as more than a chicken factory town
6405549 without mbna putting up the front money it wouldnt have been possible

6405561 it was exciting to see the size and type of fish
6405562 its better to let the fish live than to kill it just for what you can get for it here
6405563 oh my gosh thats huge look at the size of that thing
6405564 we cant give an estimation as to how old this fish is but what i can tell you is that the grouper remains soft and tasty no matter how large it gets
6405565 hey with all of this fish members of the public are free to buy some too
6405566 the arrival of this particular species is a serious problem it is not media hype the fish is remarkably well built for what it does it has a huge mouth for its size and uses a violent vacuum motion to suck in its prey
6405567 several years ago this species was sighted off the coasts of north and south carolina and since then it has also been found in the waters off florida there are any numbers of ways that this fish might have gotten here florida is a huge market for tropical fish collectors and the lionfish could have spread from a collectors tank to the sea or the fish could have arrived in the bilge water from big ships coming from asia
6405568 which infested the great lakes some years ago these small snails started to breed so fast and in such large numbers that they actually started clogging important water pipes
6405569 any time you introduce an exotic species into an environment where it can breed freely and has few if any predators there is going to be serious environmental problems there is really little that people can do except to ask fishermen and sports divers to spear and dispose of the fish
6405570 if you catch a lionfish while fishing do not attempt to remove it from your line and do not release it back into the ocean please place it in a bucket or similar container and call the doe to collect it
6405571 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
6405572 and we are asking everyone to report any sightings so that we can at least be able to judge the scale of the problem we are also working with reef the reef environmental education foundation to monitor the situation
6405573 the one good bit of news we do have is the fact that the grouper is the natural predator of the lionfish this much we know
6405574 so it is very important that we keep the population of our native grouper healthy and secure
6405575 there does not seem to be a similar thread running through them but we are not discounting it
6405576 we continue to investigate the rise in crime there and are closely monitoring the situation we have recently met up with the west bay action group and they have put forth some ideas to help

6405620 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6405621 for a common person to be sentenced to this its very sad
6405622 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
6405623 its not restricted to a particular issue or particular age group or segment of the population as long as they are viewed by authorities as potential troublemakers there is this pretty relentless effort to silence or otherwise neutralize the form of dissent
6405624 it was a positive discussion and we will now move forward together
6405625 i can confirm that we had a friendly and positive meeting and were moving forward
6405626 when i got on the show the costume designer said to me dont get the desperate housewives disease when i asked what it is she said that everybody loses weight and their clothes dont fit i do think there is that competitive dieting thing going on and because i am such a contrarian i am the only one who gained weight my clothes got tighter
6405627 we all heard stories about the fighting early on the set and i dont think that exists anymore all these actors are so professional everybody comes to the set knowing their lines everyone is on time its really a fun fun set its a great place to work
6405628 were great with me and it was sort of like oh hi dana what are you doing here
6405629 i bet you all got more dirt than a cemetary but want to criticize everyone else
6405630 had no choice but to enter into the settlement in order to avoid further incarceration
6405631 if this stands this single handedly undermines the entire civil judicial process in this country
6405632 when a person is jailed without bail for 11 months in a civil lawsuit it violates the us constitution and our basic freedoms and liberties
6405633 i bet you all got more dirt than a cemetary but want to criticize everyone else
6405634 bolt set it off after that i just think the jamaican camp went crazy
6405635 theyre running well all the way around i wouldnt say im surprised because theyve always been so strong
6405636 a half mile ocean swim an 18 mile out and back bike course and a 4 mile out and back run course
6405637 she couldnt understand why everyone is talking about that swimmer
6405638 she couldnt come up with michael phelps name and then she yammered on about how she was the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth and how that was the big story right now not the swimmer
6405639 i bet you all got more dirt than a cemetary but want to criticize everyone else

6405642 you cant fall on your face and be rewarded with an olympic medal theres no way
6405643 we will implement the technology the u k and hong kong are using but since markets vary we would not charge for online services or text messaging in the u s
6405644 our overall mobile banking program is being driven out of the u k
6405645 the big caveat is what is the adoption it would be unfair to categorize this as an immediate cash cow when it is being tested
6405646 it has the potential to be a solid new income stream lets say you put one million customers onto the service each paying 2 pounds a month thats a new revenue stream of 24 million pounds 47 million a year
6405647 whats typical for push messages those initiated by the bank is a few pounds a month 5 or 6 and for pull messages those initiated by the customer 25 pence roughly 50 cents
6405648 theres no indication that customers dont feel its a value added service
6405649 in the u s weve already positioned that as a free service to the customer

6405653 even though our survey respondents showed skepticism about the two political parties the upcoming political conventions present a significant forum for each candidate to clarify his position on healthcare costs and coverage
6405654 as our survey results validate healthcare costs remain front and center in the minds of both hr professionals and the employees they serve
6405655 many progressive organizations are already taking steps to minimize the impact to their employees and their bottom line but its clear that the majority of those we polled are looking to the government to play a proactive role
6405656 i wasnt prepared to sign anything long term at this point
6405657 i know free agency is out there but its not really a big deal
6405658 we are very pleased that the 2008 drilling was completed on schedule

6405662 it feels so good on the plane over here i was excited because its been so long since weve been over in the united kingdom and europe we feel really strongly about the album
6405663 for me it was what i wanted to do im a relentless perfectionist and i realized that a lot of the songs from my record should be pussycat dolls songs including single when i grow up next year i want to put out my solo album and i think the two will be able to co exist nicely together

6405680 this was a particularly tricky project as it required many system changes to occur in coordination with the guidewire claimcenter implementation
6405681 throughout this project hcl was responsive and adaptable to the various changes that occurred while remaining focused and productive additionally hcl has a sharp understanding of our business processes and technology environment which has offered us the added benefit of not disrupting our own staff during this important integration

6405685 their team has demonstrated a good understanding of our product and what it takes to make these mission critical enterprise projects successful
6405686 as the range of applications for our technologies has continued to broaden we are experiencing significant interest from the lighting industry electric utility companies and the investing community
6405687 in order to keep pace we will need to expand our sales and administrative staff to address our widening constituencies we realize that we are in a very positive position within the industry but we must continue to adhere to the policies of corporate responsibility and transparency which have carried us to this position we have assured our shareholders that we will be fully prepared to progress quickly and intelligently in all strategic areas
6405688 we developed and implemented a revenue generation plan in the first quarter of this year and expansion of both personnel and resources was a fundamental component of that plan as a result of licensing relationships that are developing the company is transitioning from its research and development phase into a structure that is more fully committed to sales and distribution the current interest in our technologies among established leaders in the lighting industry is a validation of our teams vision for this company and this technology and the move into a larger location is another demonstration of the companys commitment to long term viability and profitability
6405689 locus eim is the perfect software solution for ers as it will let them focus on what they do best solving complex environmental problems and not focus on installing and configuring hardware servers and software
6405690 eim gives ers the ability to collaborate easily with all project stakeholders at this large and important site ers will take advantage of eims features including laboratory analytical data management graphical visualization google mapping and a full featured geologic module to manage geologic and geotechnical data we are very pleased that shortly after the port of los angeles we added another large port to locus list of transportation clients
6405691 ers is very pleased with our selection of locus eim we provide professional services at complex environmental sites and had over 10 years of data and hundreds of thousands of records that were becoming increasingly difficult to manage using desktop systems with eim we can now quickly access our data and more importantly share the data with our clients
6405692 one key factor in the selection of locus eim was the on demand nature of the system which allowed us to quickly get up and running being web based we can access the data from the field and the office and also invite our clients to review their own data 24 7 which is a huge plus for ers and the port
6405693 while child welfare services had improved an immigration removal centre can never be a suitable place for children and we were dismayed to find cases of disabled children being detained and some children spending large amounts of time incarcerated
6405694 any period of detention can be detrimental to children and their families but the impact of lengthy detention is particularly extreme
6405695 which was not surprising given the sometimes traumatic circumstances in which many had initially been detained
6405696 we found examples in the recent past of children with disabilities who ought not to have been detained
6405697 yarls wood is to be congratulated on sustaining reasonable performance in many areas despite the upheavals of the change of management and reduction in staff numbers

6405701 some say that the olympics are just a power trip by megalomaniacs with an edifice complex who want to build big buildings
6405702 what this discussion showed us is that sporting events have the potential to change not only the infrastructure of a city but also produce a transformation of host societies
6405703 um outro objectivo que os m sseis bal sticos intercontinentais russos

6405712 nortels r amp d and incubation teams are focused on creating revolutionary communications experiences to improve the way businesses interact with their employees partners and customers and web alive will be one very tangible example of that focus
6405713 people are no longer satisfied with existing collaboration tools or with static web sites supported only by a telephone contact center as the main point of interaction they want to discuss potential purchases with others exchange ideas make business proposals and fluidly interact with others in real time
6405714 additionally web alive will offer security not available with other virtual environments today because it is integrated with corporate enterprise systems and software
6405715 estoy obligado a decir al per que ser a un grav simo error hist rico que retrasar a el cambio y mantendr a a esas comunidades agr colas en la pobreza y el marginamiento un siglo m s

6405717 i read shakespeare and the bible and i can shoot dice thats what i call a liberal education
6405718 vi ser en vis t ven i nogle af de forhandlinger vi har og vi m forvente at nogle af forhandlingerne m udskydes til 2009 n r vi kommer l ngere hen p ret melder vi ud for 2009 men der er ikke tale om at projekterne er forsvundet de er bare skubbet til 2009 men vi kan ikke komme med guidance for 2009 p nuv rende tidspunkt
6405719 der er meget fokus p at finansuroen kun vedr rer banker og ejendomsselskaber men alle virksomheder lige fra medicinalvirksomheder til it har et finansieringsbehov og det er klart at i et marked hvor der hersker usikkerhed om det finansielle der v lger bestyrelser og ledelser at tr kke beslutninger om at skyde penge i eksempelvis overtagelser eller nye virksomhedsdomiciler s for os betyder det at det tr kker ud
6405720 nej for selv i sure tid er der en attraktiv og mindre attraktiv del af markedet tingene g r ikke helt i st folk flytter stadig virksomheder spaltes og nogle fusionerer s vi forventer ikke at markedet g r helt i st men det er ikke et 2006 og 2007 aktivitetsniveau vi ser i jeblikket
6405721 os der har likviditeten f r en konkurrencefordel der er mange akt rer der bliver sat p hold i et rs tid eller to vi har konservative n gletal der g r at vi ogs kan agere i et svagt marked
6405722 these data demonstrate unequivocal excellent efficacy mediated by krp 104 that is comparable to the marketed and late stage dpp 4 compounds and supports the dosing flexibility possible with krp 104 suggested in the studies
6405723 the good tolerability observed in this trial is well supported by our extensive preclinical experience including non human primates
6405724 we continue to be optimistic about the potential of krp 104
6405725 this phase iia trial clearly demonstrates the efficacy of krp 104 and we believe that our other studies differentiate krp 104 from the competition and support our position that krp 104 has best in class potential and is an attractive partnering candidate
6405726 life is like slow death in northern europe because of the daily routine
6405727 go to work go back home study taking care of family wife etc
6405728 i read shakespeare and the bible and i can shoot dice thats what i call a liberal education
6405729 all around the gate i saw blood and human flesh people helped the injured and took them in their cars and even on motorbikes to the hospital
6405730 seven or eight people were already dead and another 10 people were breathing their last
6405731 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6405732 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6405733 i think it goes to show theres a lot of bad guys out there
6405734 a part of the worlds freedom is at stake here this is where the fight against terrorism is being waged
6405735 decided on a port randomization fix because it was doable not because it was ideal
6405736 a wake up call that everything is secure until there is an attacker
6405737 der er i europa en lidt afventende holdning frem til de n gletal vi f r fra usa i eftermiddag vi har p det seneste set nogle af de her makrotal drive markedet og det har desv rre v ret i lidt negativ retning
6405738 fls er k rt en del ned p regnskabet og det var is r ordrebogen der faldt lidt d rligere ud end ventet ligesom minerals m ske ikke helt levede op til forventningerne regnskabet var egentlig st rkt nok men alts ikke helt s st rkt som markedet havde ventet men der er ogs store forventninger til denne aktie
6405739 der var nogle ting i regnskabet som m ske ikke var helt s gode som ventet markedet havde store forventninger til det vi synes at det s meget godt ud om end ebitda var lidt under konsensus regnskabet indeholdt en opjustering men det var i tr d med markedets forventninger hvorfor aktien ikke direkte steg p regnskabet
6405740 norden handles til en p e til omkring 4 hvilket indikerer at der er beherskede indtjeningsforventninger indregnet s man kan sige at upsiden i aktien m ske er st rre end downsiden og det kan v re det markedet reagerer p i dag vi er positive over for aktien ogs i forhold til den seneste tids kursnedgang
6405741 det ser ikke s slemt ud som de gav indtryk af for et par ugers tid siden
6405742 i read shakespeare and the bible and i can shoot dice thats what i call a liberal education
6405743 as a patient myself i know how important knowledge of my treatment options is to my overall healthcare
6405744 we want patients to be able to work with their healthcare team to make the best healthcare choices possible
6405745 dre veterinary began distributing the scale aire in response to increased demand for veterinary dental equipment
6405746 the compact scale aire is easy to use and allows veterinarians to perform basic and advanced dental procedures
6405747 the aggrewell 400 plate standardizes a critical step in the development of embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells into clinically relevant mature cells
6405748 these cells have been difficult to work with because of the lack of standardized methods to culture and differentiate them the aggrewell 400 plate is the latest product in stemcell technologies portfolio that addresses the need for standardized methods and tools for stem cell research
6405749 inspiring the workforce of the future in the areas of technology engineering and science is essential to ensure continuous innovation
6405750 a shortage of school leavers and graduates in technical areas would impact not only on the uk economy but also in meeting the needs of the 21st century health sector the siemens generation 21 programme is a positive approach in promoting the study of these areas to the next generation as a company built on innovation siemens is dedicated to inspire innovators of the future
6405751 siemens healthcare challenge was a great way to encourage young people to think about the issues in healthcare today
6405752 they were required to identify key health issues that face todays society such as cancer and conduct research into the area as well as teaching students about important medical issues siemens has inspired them to think creatively and start innovating
6405753 it was so important to me to get my dog back and i was so thankful
6405754 i was really happy to see veterinarians come to new orleans it really helps every convention that comes helps a little bit i never knew that there were so many animal lovers in the world
6405755 it was a wonderful program run by the foundation the improvements made to these facilities were immense but i still believe that the people that got the most of out it were the volunteers themselves they really enjoyed contributing their time and the efforts to help rebuild new orleans
6405756 we were able to complete more work than we expected and the facilities looked so much better when we were finished
6405757 the american veterinary medical association generated over 9 million in economic impact by bringing their annual convention to new orleans in the off peak summer months which not only fueled our citys most important economic engine tourism but also supported our chefs street performers musicians artists etc that make new orleans the unique destination that it is
6405758 above and beyond avma donated their time to assist in building new homes for our animal community we cant wait to welcome them back
6405759 for years the ms society has had a library available to support the information needs of people affected by ms but there has been no way for people to search it themselves and access the documents
6405760 this new facility opens up the world class information we have from leading authors to people across the uk and around the world
6405761 if you cant access an article electronically or want to request something we dont already have get in touch
6405762 this is a fantastic resource and the first of its kind in the uk
6405763 we are very concerned about the increase in infant mortality we must take action to address this disturbing problem and to increase access to quality prenatal care throughout the state infants whose mothers receive adequate prenatal care are less likely to die in their first year of life regrettably infants who are born at low birth weight have an infant mortality rate almost 20 times higher than those born at normal weight
6405764 we are also collecting and analysing these cells at regular intervals from patients on treatment with abiraterone acetate and are identifying changes in the cancer that make it resistant to hormone treatments
6405765 the response to the first years call for applicants was global resulting in 76 applications from eight countries in north america europe and asia
6405766 the research proposals focused on 16 different prostate cancer research areas the applicants represented seven medical and scientific disciplines including medical oncology radiation oncology urology pathology imaging science and many areas of molecular science supporting a focus on prostate cancer by talented young investigators is critical to realizing the pcfs goal of accelerating breakthrough discoveries that can potentially end death and suffering from prostate cancer
6405767 we are trying our best to come out of this critical situation without any damage to afghanistan and the taliban
6405768 it would be best if the arrest or killing of any hvt high value target were announced on 26 27 or 28 july
6405769 if we dont find these guys by the election they are going to stick the whole nuclear mess up our a hole
6405770 the uk has a long and distinguished record in promoting altitude research and the study of altitude related illness many travellers from the uk take to the hills for recreation or business so this is relevant to our local population
6405771 it was a great opportunity to climb with some top guides so i have learned or brushed up on lots of climbing skills the academic side was superb with lectures from some of the most famous people in altitude physiology and i have practised my pre hospital care skills which is great for a teaching hospital medic like me
6405772 this tool is a critical first step in helping hospitals evaluate their disaster plans to find out what works and what doesnt
6405773 that knowledge can help hospitals make important changes to their response plans now before a disaster strikes
6405774 use of nicotine replacement therapy nrt during pregnancy is controversial because nrt contains one of the toxins in tobacco smoke and not much is known about the safety of nrt use during pregnancy
6405775 our study suggests that nrt assisted smoking cessation or smoking reduction in early pregnancy provides some protection from stillbirth among women who continue to smoke during pregnancy more research on a range of smoking associated health outcomes is needed if we are to understand the overall safety of nrt use in pregnancy
6405776 most women tend to be sensible when they are pregnant and work hard at adopting healthier lifestyles
6405777 giving up on tobacco can be difficult as it is addictive but there are ways to manage the cravings during this period a slow weaning off from tobacco and a combination of nrt and behavioural therapy is advised
6405778 the best result from this is the birth of a healthy baby however the long term aim for the mother should be to stop smoking
6405779 misinterpretation of shariah by those who the mcb had trusted to take the lead
6405780 the mcb rejects the misguided and incorrect assertions made by and ascribed to the muslim institute
6405781 bolt set it off after that i just think the jamaican camp went crazy
6405782 theyre running well all the way around i wouldnt say im surprised because theyve always been so strong
6405783 bolt set it off after that i just think the jamaican camp went crazy
6405784 theyre running well all the way around i wouldnt say im surprised because theyve always been so strong
6405785 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6405786 who is to say the crazy bears werent exiled to our planet for some crime or other infraction of the laws of another planet or dimension we might add
6405787 on the other hand it is not inconceivable that the hairy ones are the food animals of some distant world and have been planted here on earth to produce herds just as the old shipmasters used to place pigs and goats on islands to multiply and furnish food for later voyagers
6405788 that they have not proliferated in great numbers may be due to their inability to provide for themselves especially if they have been kept as produce animals for generations
6405789 or perhaps the climate the atmosphere or the food available to them is against their best survival purposes who knows
6405790 the picnic is an attempt to reclaim public space alcohol bans are the result of a top down bureaucratic definition of public space and an over the top response to perceived antisocial behaviour and social breakdown
6405791 the longer these bans are imposed the more each of us refuse to take responsibility for public space and stop resolving our own issues leading to a more antisocial society this is not a campaign for drunkenness its for the public right to engage in our own space
6405792 the police should be concerned with people breaking the law not with these so called preventative measures cultural issues are not solved with blanket bans but by political and social engagement for which we need a vibrant public sphere
6405793 we want to raise awareness and are expecting to attract people who are annoyed at this fundamental civil liberties issue
6405794 well see what happens but its a bank holiday all over london people will be getting drunk most will not be causing any trouble
6405795 residents in communities around the country rate this is as one of the issues theyd most like to see dealt with
6405796 the aim of these powers is not to criminalise drinkers or drink itself but rather to give police added enforcement powers to seize alcohol from those posing a nuisance to those around you they are only a potential option and in most cases tend to employed in a limited targeted manner after it has been established that a specific area poses particular problems for the community
6405797 and hopefully voters will give us a chance to improve facilities by voting in favor of a bond issue
6405798 there are still a couple of issues that were wrestling with but that 135 million figure is correct as of the end of wednesday afternoon
6405799 honestly i dont see how this has much to do with your election
6405800 the bottom line is they had sold these coffins to people and they were imitations of an american made casket and so they got a restraining order to stop doing that
6405801 should have been aware of this going on and here hes actively marketing foreign products undermining american made products
6405802 the product the chinese are offering us now its a quality product
6405803 you put a chinese casket next to a york casket or one of these other manufacturers you cant tell the difference
6405804 sought the endorsement of local labor unions for financial support and votes in the november general election
6405805 needs to fess up to his union supporters about his participation in exporting american jobs to china
6405806 libelous containing many misstatements of fact and stating conclusions that are meant to do nothing but maliciously harm crowder funeral homes
6405807 graeme was an inspiration to me when i was younger
6405808 when i was just starting on the track he was winning his first world title in norway in 1993 to see a scottish rider someone who had no backing at the time who had no funding no support and was doing it off his own bat
6405809 he had such a unique character the way he looked at things in terms of his event he was like no one else if we could get someone like that on board thats when crazy ideas come to fruition and he could reinvent the wheel he could come up with something amazing which could help us in four years time who knows
6405810 i think it would be inspired to bring graeme to the party they should do that just think about what he achieved he reinvented the position once they banned it he reinvented it again and he was able to do that in the space of a couple of years i think he has that inspirational factor people watching the film the flying scotsman people who have nothing to do with cycling have been inspired by that but if he could have a direct input into the performances now hed get a big kick out of that
6405811 if they called id talk to them of course i think ive unfinished business at first ill not say anything about it ive spoken too much in the past now its time for action
6405812 im impressed by the whole british team theyve gone through everything analytically they threw out the dead wood tradition dogma started from complete scratch

6405822 the budget delay hits our cash flow at about 500 000 a month
6405823 the primary source of our revenue is medi cal reimbursements for patient visits were seeing the patients but were not getting paid
6405824 the state is sitting on our money while we have to borrow money with interest theyre not paying us interest for the money theyre holding
6405825 right now that line of credit is costing us 8 percent
6405826 either it comes out of the agency or the taxpayer
6405827 we already ask providers to wait a month to be reimbursed for the child care that theyve provided
6405828 and now we have to tell them that we dont know when we can pay them again because we dont know when the budget will be signed

6405835 there is nothing around their home intended to prevent the occasional entry by a stranger onto their driveway there is no gate no keep out sign nor guard dog standing watch
6405836 the journalist would want to talk to their lawyer before they do that
6405837 i wouldnt be comfortable saying dont worry about it because there is aerial photography
6405838 the court system is often very protective of peoples rights to keep people off their land
6405839 google like any other member of the public was privileged to briefly drive up plaintiffs driveway
6405840 turning around in a private driveway while photographing the exterior of a home is not a substantial intrusion
6405841 its something we have to come to grips with the tension between new technology and privacy
6405842 not because im pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually i think they wrestle with these things in profound ways

6405854 it is time to put the pervez musharraf phenomena behind us
6405855 a failure to hold musharraf and the army responsible will only result in those abuses continuing and hamper pakistans development into a full democracy
6405856 if this does not work our people will follow him musharraf wherever he goes and whenever they find a chance theyll kill him or get hold of him alive

6405913 it falls short of being four 1 records in a row i think with the jonas brothers second week
6405914 half of that is more than what well sell and its good for those guys all i can say is weve been here for 10 years and this is our sixth record i feel proud to be able to say that if its not 1 its not 1 what are you going to do
6405915 but its just a different version of the boy band thing all over again
6405916 we went in and started writing and the songs that were coming out werent the heaviest songs but they were really good songs
6405917 we wrote 14 songs and there are 13 on the album there was only one song that didnt make it and it wasnt because it didnt stand up i just couldnt come up with anything to sing over it musically it was one of my favorite songs on the record i just couldnt come up with anything that was worthy of it in a melody and lyrical sense the songs we were writing were great songs we couldnt cast them aside and say no those arent heavy enough if we had wed probably still be there writing
6405918 i hope theyre happy surprised and that they can just realize that we wrote the best songs we could
6405919 we work very hard to grow as a band and i think we made a pretty good step this time

6405933 we will implement the technology the u k and hong kong are using but since markets vary we would not charge for online services or text messaging in the u s
6405934 our overall mobile banking program is being driven out of the u k
6405935 the big caveat is what is the adoption it would be unfair to categorize this as an immediate cash cow when it is being tested
6405936 it has the potential to be a solid new income stream lets say you put one million customers onto the service each paying 2 pounds a month thats a new revenue stream of 24 million pounds 47 million a year
6405937 whats typical for push messages those initiated by the bank is a few pounds a month 5 or 6 and for pull messages those initiated by the customer 25 pence roughly 50 cents
6405938 theres no indication that customers dont feel its a value added service
6405939 in the u s weve already positioned that as a free service to the customer

6405946 everyones questioning their ability but you have to get over it
6405947 so dani roche she had a talk with the girls and showed them a medal and talked to them about youve got to get yourself back up and fight for it were putting in too much work to just go away empty handed
6405948 theres a bunch of us who played in athens in this same game and we didnt come away with a medal
6405949 i think that was on our minds knowing we were in the same position and we definitely didnt want it to happen again
6405950 i know her quite well and i thought back to where she likes to shoot
6405951 when she was going to shoot i just kept saying keep it down low keep it down low just dont get sucked in and i did that

6405956 the mosquito magnets we put in public places improve the quality of life for personnel living on base
6405957 residents can use more public areas on base with minimal distractions from these nuisance insects
6405958 certain viruses cant be detected in a populated area but by trapping and testing mosquitoes in certain places we are able to detect and quarantine preventing potential disease outbreaks
6405959 the mission will continue to go on despite the mosquito population but we will try to ease the nuisance factor for personnel working outside as much as possible

6405962 good communication ensures the air force efficiently uses each seat in its formal training program and in doing so prepares airmen for mission requirements both on station and at deployed locations
6405963 in addition it also helps air force schools maintain enough seats for future training needs
6405964 afpc has the capability to cancel a training line number up to 24 hours prior to a class start date wed prefer to have at least 10 duty days advanced notice as this would allow us time to re advertise the opening to the rest of the career field and find another individual to attend
6405965 this effort really exemplifies how the three alcs by working together as a team can rapidly respond to almost any warfighter need
6405966 this is the way of the future and we can see it from where we sit today
6405967 we notified them of this particular project and the urgency of it and they all marched out and did their jobs they executed to get the part prototyped and in production in record time
6405968 it gives us the opportunity to showcase what were about and what we can do especially our rapid manufacturing capabilities
6405969 the tankers exterior lighting is not currently compatible with night vision goggle operations which limits the receivers ability to use their night vision systems during air refueling operations
6405970 our solution is simple modify tanker aircraft with night vision friendly exterior lighting and night vision compatible interior lighting for the boom pod this can have an immediate impact for our tanker forces in the deployed theater
6405971 the idea is to make air refueling at night safer
6405972 right now during night time air refueling operations in black out conditions pilots in aircraft receiving fuel have to remove their night vision goggles prior to an air refueling to prevent required visual references from being washed out or obscured in the night vision goggle image also current external lighting on the aircraft is easily detected by ground threats using the unaided eye correcting these deficiencies has a direct impact on mission accomplishment and safety in flight
6405973 in setting this up we looked for low cost commercial and government off the shelf lighting technology to make the kc 135 exterior and boom pod interior lighting selectively night vision compatible yet undetectable to the unaided eye
6405974 then the afrl stepped in and designed and installed the lighting solutions to save time and cost and to decrease risk lighting luminance assessments were done in a controlled laboratory environment prior to hardware installation on the kc 135 used for the demonstration
6405975 this initiative showed that a low cost night vision lighting alternative is out there and is feasible we found that a night vision lighting system can eliminate the time necessary for receiver pilots to don or doff their night vision equipment while performing night time air refueling operations this is an improved capability when compared to the current operations in the field
6405976 the national guard bureau and other agencies are pursuing funding to accomplish flight and environmental testing on the night vision lighting system
6405977 it is ambs recommendation this initiative be considered for fielding by air mobility command as resources allow and requirements dictate
6405978 every environment is different the resources are different what you can use and what the people will accept is even different
6405979 even if you discover something that has already been done you have to figure out how to get it accepted here you have to be able to work with people on a human level those were our challenges in the beginning we realized early that half of our job was going to be to sell the solution
6405980 when i was at physician assistant school i never even considered that i would do anything like this
6405981 the reality of it is when you get out into your job you have to look around in the environment to find out what the problems are and decide how you re going to fix them
6405982 when we got here all we could see is what we could not do
6405983 we had to learn and accept what we could do and do it to the best of our ability once we got to that phase we took off like a runaway train it almost got simpler when we took a step back you cant solve all of these childrens individual medical problems but you can tackle very simple things that is going to impact a lot of people
6405984 once we convinced them to taste it they realized it was a good thing and they all gave their verbal pledge which is a big deal
6405985 they all stood up and agreed that their village and their families would use it
6405986 everything that we are doing goes back to clean their water
6405987 we are really trying to get to the lowest common denominator with everything
6405988 we are using this particular recipe because there is no cooking required
6405989 the types of ingredients we are using are not water based so this can stand on a shelf without refrigeration for four months this really works perfectly it wont go bad it wont cause disease and it wont cause sickness
6405990 we can teach them to make this the materials are here in the country and they can sustain this they just need to know how to do it and know that it exists
6405991 the children dont have to actually chew it they can suck on it they dont have to have a lot of strength or teeth
6405992 they are educated they see what we are doing for them and they are very appreciative one of the reasons they are so happy about this is they see us doing something and they know they can do it too
6405993 it is not just something we will implement while we are here and then we leave it is gone they are going to take this and they are going to run with it they want their kids to survive and now they are getting the tools to do it and realizing they can do it themselves
6405994 it is not unrealistic to cut the child birth mortality rate in half in an area with the implementation of this course
6405995 we are ready to see these programs moved on to a larger scale
6405996 the taliban works to say we are infidels i think the people we affect with our work see that we are trying to learn their ways and see that we are trying to adapt to their way we are trying to find ways to help them while respecting their culture an acceptance based on this will allow us to take big steps forward in working ourselves out of a job
6405997 it is our thoughts alone that cause us pain nothing external to our mind can hurt us there is no other cause of oppression than that of our erroneous thoughts nothing but our own perceptions affect us
6405998 all emotions is energy in motion coming from some root or thought though it is usually frustratingly hidden from our sight this is why when serious depression anxiety or phobias set in we usually turn to psychology or psychtherapy in order to exhume the erroneous beliefs that caused the symptoms to manifest in our psyche
6405999 we do not consciously choose an emotion however all emotions we feel come from deep seated experiences through patterns and beliefs that haveconditioned us to respond emotionally emotion is the psyches way to get our attention whether it is negative or possitive emotion is there for good reasons but if not properly understood and directed it will often turn against us how does it do this by causeing us to react in negative ways emotions hurt others and ourselves if negative emotion is repressed as it so often is we see the result as illness expressed in different ways through out the body when emotion surfaces it is always important to be alert to what it is trying to tell us it is what we do with that emotion and where we direct it that can be either destructive or empowering
6406000 god has blessed me working in maintenance saved my life
6406001 by taking the calls she frees up the five technicians to do their jobs rather than being bogged down answering phones
6406002 her voice is the first one a resident hears when they need something fixed and dians voice always has a smile
6406003 shes a caring individual who lives here herself and knows the apartment layouts personally
6406004 she also understands the lingo of our average resident the thing a ma bob in my sink is broken and can decipher that information into a recognizable work order for the technicians
6406005 youd think she was making 500 a week instead of volunteering
6406006 the amount of savings that dian has contributed to the afev by volunteering her time 40 hours a week for the past three years is approximately 60 000
6406007 and were blessed to have her here no one deserves the fahsa award more

6406013 controllers affect every mission departure and arrival of the busiest aerial port in air mobility command
6406014 they also have the responsibility of talking directly with the wing commander as his voice to amc headquarters for any reportable mishaps or unusual occurrences this takes a high degree of professionalism and job knowledge
6406015 were the focal point for the flow of information throughout the base
6406016 we monitor and flight follow all aircraft arriving and departing 24 hours a day 365 days a year
6406017 were to be trustworthy professionals who take pride in what we do because there is no room for error or downtime when were working to become the best in the air force
6406018 when something happens on or off base were the first to know and we notify everyone necessary to take action
6406019 if you enjoy working in a fast paced world this may be the job for you because there is excitement in our career field as we deal with a high breadth of knowledge
6406020 i enjoy my job because i see how everyone fits in in a bigger sense i get to see the bigger picture of the overall operations of the air force
6406021 i always thought a command post controllers job was controlling the giant voice but ever since i started training ive come to realize that this is one of the hardest jobs
6406022 ive had to learn a lot in a short period of time and it has definitely opened my eyes to our air force giving me a broader respect for our mission and what we do
6406023 my airmen do their jobs admirably and professionally twenty four hours a day seven days a week
6406024 they handle everything from presidential support missions maintaining point of contact for dover airmen against drunk driving on the weekends sending all reportable incidents to higher headquarters emergency action messages unsafe weather notifications and everything in between
6406025 the wing mission would not be possible without the awesome teamwork between command post and all the wing agencies
6406026 we know there will be no problem transporting seed interstate
6406027 however there will be international restrictions but that will be very minimal and just for seed only nine countries have restrictions and we primarily send seed to two or three of them so this will be very manageable for everybody
6406028 weve had a lot of reports from growers thinking that their fields may be showing signs of goss bacterial wilt
6406029 we encourage farmers to bring in fresh samples of corn leaves from suspect fields
6406030 this conference is a tremendous opportunity for those serving in and supporting our air force to meet and share their knowledge and ideas
6406031 air force professional organizations are important to airmen their families and the mission
6406032 these organizations enhance the professional development of our airmen and provide visibility for our air space and cyberspace missions at regional and local levels around the nation
6406033 bringing together first sergeants from bases around the globe enhances cross communication to enlisted leaders who are key to the morale welfare and leadership of our airmen
6406034 subject matter experts and leaders brief active duty reserve and guard first sergeants on updates to issues and challenges surrounding our enlisted force and their families
6406035 by bringing our senior enlisted leaders together to participate in discussions and hear briefers from across the air force spectrum we better enable our senior enlisted leaders to address air force focus areas from a timely and relevant perspective
6406036 its really neat that airmen can brush elbows with leaders like the chief master sergeant of the air force and former chief master sergeants of the air force
6406037 to hear them speak to sit in the same room with them really motivates you and charges you up to go out and do a better job
6406038 afsa works for us they fight for our pay raises our education and healthcare benefits and many of the other things we need we should really support them
6406039 they come from a different system of logic than our own

6406138 similar attacks will be carried out in other cities of pakistan including lahore islamabad and rawalpindi
6406139 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge

6406144 i think jim is a passion for the game and the program here at western michigan is tremendous

6406155 he is a bloke who is influential he is a bloke who is inspirational because he does intimidate and blokes alongside him tend to respond to that
6406156 it is good to have him back but most importantly it is good for him
6406157 he didnt enjoy watching the last outing and hopefully he brings that grumpiness with him
6406158 you dont need to read too much into that because the volume of game time wont change just the order
6406159 it is not a reflection of ranking so to speak it is the order we are using this week we will be looking to matty to put the after burners on and well respond to what we see
6406160 it is going to be dry it is going to be fast so that order serves
6406161 we have got versatility in the mix and in terms of covering fullback ryan cross will do that
6406162 he has background in that position and he has done well with each opportunity he has got
6406163 at times there it was obvious we took the wrong option
6406164 a couple of times it was on and we just didnt pull it off so skill execution and wrong options a couple of times there were off but the thing is were having a go its just when to take them weve just got to be a bit more clinical when we do do it
6406165 i think next game weve got to be a bit more dominant with our ball carries and hold the ball longer because it shows in the last few tests whoever holds the ball the longest is usually scoring points so its going to be pretty important for us on the weekend

6406187 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded
6406188 important sign that the end of official dialogue between washington and damascus has not prevented dialogue with important american intellectuals and politicians
6406189 he is leading a delegation for rand and they will be in damascus it is a high level delegation and they are meeting with some high level people in the region there is no shortage of issues in the middle east to discuss as im sure you know
6406190 the first we heard of this trip was from you
6406191 brzezinski is not a day to day adviser for the campaign he is someone whose guidance senator obama seeks on iraq
6406192 people are going to say if you are advising obama you are representing obama
6406193 at this time when we are in the middle of an election i cant believe that for him to go to syria at this moment would not appear he was going with at least some tacit approval of the candidate he is advising i would think he would realize that
6406194 in light of the ongoing syrian interference in the presidential election process in lebanon the continued flow of foreign fighters into iraq from syria the continued support for palestinian terrorist groups and hezbollah we call on damascus to cease its destructive tactics
6406195 meeting with several different people community leaders and government officials throughout the middle east
6406196 i urged him to move ahead in the israel syria negotiations as much as possible so that whoever is the next president would not start from too far down the track
6406197 i did not say anything about obama or mccain i said whoever is the next president is not going to want to inherit a process that isnt going anywhere
6406198 if one of senator obamas advisers has been to damascus we just wonder how many have been to tehran
6406199 we oppose the appointment of kurtzer because of his long documented record of hostility to and severe pressure upon israel
6406200 with jews like kurtzer it is impossible to build a healthy relationship between israel and the united states
6406201 frequently pressured israel to make one sided concessions to the arabs he constantly blamed israel for the absence of mideast peace and paid little or no attention to the fact that the palestinians were carrying out terrorist attacks and openly calling for the destruction of israel
6406202 kurtzer will use his jewishness as a protective cover for his anti israel views
6406203 possibly more than any other u s state department official kurtzer has been instrumental in promoting the goals of the palestinians and in raising their afflictions to the center of the u s policymakers agenda
6406204 attacked the israeli government for refusing to include the plo in the peace process and said that this constituted the main obstacle to peace

6406343 to be frank i was quite horrified at some of the information you showed me concerning patients and particularly children
6406344 i regard this as absolute tardiness and of course these are disciplinary matters for the trusts with regard to their staff
6406345 we cannot have confidential information on patients going out in this way
6406346 i appreciate a lot of information flows within the nhs out of hospitals into hospitals but we must try and protect patient records
6406347 its the duty of everyone to ensure that they go to the right address and that record arent left lying around

6406374 we will get 1 of the 4 6 billion enterprise 2 0
6406375 there is absolutely a lack of confidence the fact is everybody in this market are playing blinkers and are looking at losses that they have suffered over the last 6 months and this is going to be a massive erosion of market capital and anybody has not made any money in the last 6 months lets accept this fact so people with deep pockets at 13 000 13 500 what mean to say is i am not trying to state that it will be the bottom i am not trying to state that it will go back to that level what i am trying to state is the level at which i am comfortable i am going to buy let the market slide a little bit more but wait for the right time may be next one to three months are going to be 10 15 higher in many scrips scrips which possibly you and me going to buy into and that is exactly what has happened just about a month ago
6406376 i am not here to predict as to what level we can fall what i am trying to state is that the level which i see i am going to enter making some money over the next 2 3 months and its only when the markets are going to start moving may be 2 3 4 6 months later and when it happens later possibly at higher levels and the retail investors who are going to get some confidence back are going to come back into the market thereby pushing up the volumes little bit more
6406377 when i see people with deep pockets what i mean is people who are having money as well as ready to wait for sometime because even look at a stock like when i say look at an interest rate sensitive kind of stock like maruti which came out with dismal results the stock came down rightly but yet at the end of it this stock was amongst those stocks which came with maximum returns in the last one month so whether it is a hdfc bank or an icici bank or may be a kotak yes bank even the hdfc itself or reliance capital if you look at the way the stocks have moved over the last 1 1 5 months and the way they have fallen in the last 4 5 days i think possibly a 3 5 fall from here and i think i am ready to look at buying into it

6406386 we were able to sit in the court and could meet him but the sight of him being handcuffed was not nice as he is a monk he was also made to wear an ordinary longyi

6406392 the south is constructing new marinas with large capacities this is what our country needs because the hotels are going through a difficult phase due to the lack of tourists thus the government should place more importance in the construction of marinas rather than increasing bed capacity
6406393 the government should involve the stakeholders when giving decisions on project which are likely to have an impact on the environment

6406507 maybe in other years id be more picky about it
6406508 people understand that this is a tough year and that rudy giuliani is admired nationally for both his success as new york mayor but also his performance after 9 11
6406509 while people have significant differences with rudy giuliani they will understand the value in showcasing him at the convention
6406510 im honored to be a keynote speaker at the republican national convention and tell the american people why john has the experience character and courage to lead the country
6406511 there is no better opportunity to remind people what i have known about john all along he is a proven leader who will put country first and tackle the tough issues head on
6406512 the mccain campaign makes decisions in what is in the best interests of the mccain campaign
6406513 john mccain is running a very powerful ad right now characterizing himself as the original maverick and as one who is ready to lead it is something that he and rudy giuliani share they have proven leadership in the toughest of times
6406514 the battleground is always in the middle its not the party regulars on the left or the right but slam dab in the center yes rudy will help with the independents but hell also rally the troops by his ability to get the convention rocking and rolling
6406515 it would seem to me that the republican party is not as far as i can tell and i have traveled to thousands of places last year a one issue party and that would just be one issue among many that would have to be evaluated by the party but i believe the party will support senator mccains choice
6406516 actually my understanding is that yesterday fox news reported the r n c said mccain is no longer considering any candidates who are pro choice to your knowledge is that incorrect
6406517 we could do a call all day about senator mccains v p choices frankly were not talking about senator mccains v p choices until he makes a v p choice
6406518 we wanted to do a community recognition program spotlighting folks in the city or the township who have done something special
6406519 in future years well try to heighten this with annual planning of awards
6406520 the boys and girls committee is his true love as far as helping the community
6406521 im one of the fortunate ones because i grew up here so i got to give back to the people who gave to me a lot of things dont get done unless volunteers do them
6406522 i was a volunteer for 2 years so i really got to see that side
6406523 its an amazing feeling to be able to give back to your community volunteerism is what runs things
6406524 theyre not instant gratification it takes years to see the fruits of their work and these people have been very diligent over the years in trying to see these projects through
6406525 the vision we had in 2000 and still have now is to preseve the beautiful rural character of our township these people work hard for that vision
6406526 we are getting on with the job and you will see us dealing with some of the issues about which britishers are most concerned like their gas and electricity bill and oil price when we come back in september
6406527 no one makes advance announcements on things like that and we are currently concentrating on economic issues

6406530 cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved
6406531 the wicked borroweth and payeth not again but the righteous sheweth mercy and giveth
6406532 he that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor
6406533 what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us
6406534 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things
6406535 and that you study to be quiet and to do your own business and to work with your own hands as we commanded you
6406536 greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends
6406537 whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest

6406543 it is not just this game where there have been problems
6406544 weve got 10 days away and if we can thrash things out before the world cup campaign starts we will be ok
6406545 there have been other games and there will be problems in the future that will occur
6406546 we need to sit down and address it and address it very quickly otherwise it stays around the squad the manager will thrash things out and we will get things off our chest
6406547 that will be very private the manager makes the big decisions we can give our opinion but he is the one who makes those big final decisions
6406548 i think we are all a little bit disappointed with how we played
6406549 there were some pluses and some negatives to take away from the game but overall i think the feeling is disappointment
6406550 i think the fans will be disappointed with what they have seen i think there are three or four positives and maybe four or five negatives from the game
6406551 we are still encouraged by what we can do in zagreb
6406552 against the czechs we wanted to do better than we did but at the same time there will be points to be played for with andorra and croatia

6406612 but its just a different version of the boy band thing all over again
6406613 we went in and started writing and the songs that were coming out werent the heaviest songs but they were really good songs
6406614 we wrote 14 songs and there are 13 on the album there was only one song that didnt make it and it wasnt because it didnt stand up i just couldnt come up with anything to sing over it musically it was one of my favorite songs on the record i just couldnt come up with anything that was worthy of it in a melody and lyrical sense the songs we were writing were great songs we couldnt cast them aside and say no those arent heavy enough if we had wed probably still be there writing
6406615 i hope theyre happy surprised and that they can just realize that we wrote the best songs we could
6406616 we work very hard to grow as a band and i think we made a pretty good step this time

6406643 joachim l w wie bewerten sie das 2 0 gegen belgien
6406644 das 2 0 war verdient das ergebnis ist aber zweitrangig ich wollte sehen dass die mannschaft versucht zu kombinieren dass die spielaufl sung gut ist und wir im fluss sind das hat sie sehr gut umgesetzt wir haben den gegner beherrscht in der ersten halbzeit hat nur ein tor gefehlt f r diese fr he phase der saison sind wir aber sehr positiv aufgetreten das war ein gutes warm up f r die wm qualifikation
6406645 wie sch tzen sie das deb t von serdar tasci ein
6406646 f r das erste l nderspiel hat er seine sache wirklich gut gemacht die dinge die ich gefordert habe hat er gut gel st serdar hat taktisch gut gespielt und war stark im zweikampf aber nat rlich haben ihn die belgier auch nicht ganz so gefordert
6406647 ist das innenverteidiger duo tasci und heiko westermann eine alternative zu christoph metzelder und per mertesacker
6406648 die innenverteidigung bei der em war nicht so stark und pr sent wie bei der wm da gab es abstimmungsprobleme wir brauchen daher alternativen weshalb es wichtig war tasci und westermann zu sehen sie haben die sache konsequent umgesetzt ich bin froh ber die alternativen
6406649 in michael ballack und torsten frings mussten sie zwei wichtige spieler ersetzen wie beurteilen sie die leistung von thomas hitzlsperger und simon rolfes
6406650 wir wissen was wir an michael und torsten haben aber ich m chte den konkurrenzkampf haben ich bin froh ber die gute leistung von thomas hitzlsperger und simon rolfes denn das gibt den spielern selbstvertrauen dar ber kann ich als trainer nur froh sein
6406651 das ist ein gesundes selbstbewusstsein er ist schon l nger dabei und sein ziel ist es einfach stammspieler zu werden das ist legitim
6406652 bastian schweinsteiger war gegen belgien in der zweiten h lfte zum ersten mal kapit n und verwandelte den wichtigen elfmeter zum 1 0 kann er der kommende f hrungsspieler werden
6406653 bastian hat bei der em besonders nach dem portugal spiel an selbstevertrauen gewonnen er muss jetzt immer mehr in die verantwortung hineinwachsen um dann eine f hrungsrolle bernehmen zu k nnen
6406654 erneut hat kein st rmer ein tor erzielt bereitet ihnen das sorgen f r die wm qualifikation
6406655 das beunruhigt mich wenig ich habe gesagt dass sie druck aus ben sollen das haben in der ersten halbzeit klose und podolski und dann gomez und kuranyi gut gemacht man kennt die abschlussst rke unserer st rmer ich erwarte auch von patrick helmes in den kommenden monaten einiges denn er hat ein gro es potenzial sid schlagw rter alternativen belgien frage thomas hitzlsperger leistung joachim l w l w portugal sache bastian schweinsteiger st rmer tor artikel bewerten zur bestenliste drucken versenden es ist folgender eingabefehler aufgetreten kommentar schreiben login berschrift name ihr kommentar netiquette agb kommentar abschicken meistkommentierte artikel die aktivsten user vielen dank ihr kommentar wurde abgeschickt login im interesse aller user behalten wir uns vor jeden beitrag vor der ver ffentlichung zu pr fen als registrierter nutzer verf gen sie ber 800 statt 400 zeichen textl nge und werden automatisch per mail benachrichtigt wenn ihr kommentar freigeschaltet wurde jetzt registrieren falls sie schon einen account haben k nnen sie sich jetzt einloggen ihr gerade geschriebener kommentar wird dann mit ihrem account verkn pft wenn sie dieses oder hnliche themen mit anderen diskutieren wollen besuchen sie unsere foren http bb focus de focus index php e mail passwort logindaten abschicken archiv sport sitemap sport sport abonnieren mehr sport service community news fotos videos r ckblick auf die em 2008 r ckblick deutschlands em 2008 spanien der weg zum em titel em statistik tore sch sse fouls und karten em 2008 h hepunkte eines tollen turniers t rkei die comeback fighter em 2008 schweinsteigers achterbahnfahrt wm 2006 r ckblick aus dfb sicht die sch nsten wm momente in bildern die wm des j rgen klinsmann viele tr nen der wm traum ist vorbei bankw rmer so sah king kahn die wm spielerfrauen die sch nen girls der kicker wm zaungast maradona flippt v llig aus wm 2006 r ckblick ii im finale zinedine zidane rastet aus sommertraum bezaubernde wm eindr cke kleines finale stuttgart sagt danke
6406656 n ez feijoo y el pp en general est n muy preocupados porque saben que no han merecido la confianza de los gallegos durante estos tres a os
6406657 saben que el gobierno de touri o merece el aprobado amplio de los gallegos y que genera confianza frente a los populares y a n ez feijoo que est n inquietos porque antes tendr n que irse a su casa ya que su proyecto pol tico no conecta con el sentimiento mayoritario de la sociedad gallega
6406658 interesante pensando en galicia y en los intereses de los gallegos
6406659 van a garantizar una mayor inversi n para galicia sobre las prioridades que se han determinado
6406660 orden a touri o adelantar las elecciones para oto o de este a o
6406661 para no agotar la legislatura y disolver el parlamento un a o antes del per odo legal
6406662 por qu tenemos que estar preocupados por las elecciones vascas
6406663 minimizar los devastadores efectos pol ticos de un enga o econ mico
6406664 para que la gente no observe los problemas econ micos que tenemos en galicia
6406665 los intereses de galicia no iban en primer lugar sino los del psoe
6406666 utilizaci n partidista por parte del aparato de la xunta de galicia
6406667 se re nan en sede de la presidencia para tratar asuntos exclusivamente de partido
6406668 encuestas de la xunta que los diputados no conocemos pero s parece que los se ores psoe de madrid tienen derecho a conocer
6406669 jos blanco dio instrucciones para celebrar las elecciones en el per odo de oto o
6406670 blanco volvi a decir que las elecciones tienen que ser en oto o y supongo que touri o anunciar la pr xima semana el mandato recibido del psoe
6406671 ni el gobierno se pone de acuerdo en la fecha de las elecciones
6406672 sigue constatando la divisi n la descoordinaci n y el boicot entre las fuerzas que componen el gobierno
6406673 ya est bien con la crisis econ mica como para que tengamos que capear tambi n con una crisis pol tica

6406678 thanks to everyday americans who chose to make a difference millions of lives have been saved in the worlds poorest countries
6406679 we want to remind them that the public is out there eager for them to say more about this
6406680 maybe the applause has gone to his head saying john mccain cost ohio jobs though its just not true its obamas taxes that will hurt ohio families higher taxes on your paycheck your life savings your electric bills his taxes are a recipe for economic disaster thats the real obama ready to tax not ready to lead
6406681 not something that lends itself to on the job training
6406682 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
6406683 the thing that terrifies me the most is that someone might hate me as much as i loathe you
6406684 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6406685 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6406686 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6406687 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6406688 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6406689 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in

6406694 the fans have been looking forward to this for years it will be a unique atmosphere
6406695 our supporters will surprise a lot of clubs the atmosphere in the stadium on saturday will be electric
6406696 our stadium is a fantastic stadium when its full it will surprise a few clubs and it will certainly surprise the people outside of stoke on trent

6406699 the current economic conditions the uncertainties surrounding the general financial markets and mortgage availability will be defining factors in the return to a more normal housing market
6406700 until we see an improvement in respect of these factors it is difficult to predict the short term future with confidence
6406701 george bush is a complete idiot who has alienated many cultures in the world and propagated terrorism
6406702 gradually i realised that the wiggle of the head was a signal to others that i carried an amiable and disarming message i am a peaceful man i dont mean any harm

6406711 weve really achieved the ideal of what i wanted microsoft to become
6406712 any people who have been persecuted for 2000 years must be doing something wrong
6406713 it has a powerful impact on the supply side and the demand side
6406714 a lot of people have withdrawn properties from the market
6406715 theres an issue of what kind of impression are you creating here
6406716 gallup uses 2 000 telephone interviews to represent the entire country
6406717 our donors continue to impress me with their steadfast dedication to helping uncw soar to new heights
6406718 matt and lucy damon had a baby girl named gia zavala on wednesday august 20th everyones doing great
6406719 the troops are alert all along the loc to foil any evil design of the enemy
6406720 i gather that 140 tibetans were killed although the figure needs to be confirmed
6406721 since the riots in march reliable witnesses have established that 400 people have been killed in the lhasa area alone if you consider the whole of tibet the number of victims is obviously higher
6406722 we know about disturbances in the kham region but we do not have any details or figures about injuries or deaths
6406723 nor do we have any exact dates for the disturbances
6406724 ten thousand people have been arrested since march we dont know where they are being held
6406725 the military presence in tibet is old but the frenzy of new construction in the amdo and kham regions makes me say that this colonisation by the army is designed to last
6406726 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of august 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers
6406727 but so far we havent seen anything except for promises
6406728 by the end of the 22nd we will pull back to the checkpoints line
6406729 first his troops are going to be out on monday then his troops were going to be out on wednesday now his troops are going to be out on friday
6406730 im beginning to wonder if the russian president is ever going to keep his word or can he keep his word or whats going on there
6406731 these allegations be they true or false this one included theyre all turning points to a more open sumo
6406732 its good for the sport in the end it can open up the sport make them follow modern society
6406733 the nose of the plane and the front wheels had lifted
6406734 whether the rear wheels got off the ground is still being investigated
6406735 it was like a scene from hell bodies were everywhere
6406736 it would be foolhardy at this point to rule out the checklight problem as a contributing factor
6406737 regulations governing all craft ensure that even after losing power in one engine the plane still has enough power to take off
6406738 given the rear position of the engines on the md 82
6406739 if there was an explosion there it may have meant the loss of control of the rudder and tail
6406740 we believe that the explosion was caused by plastic explosives detonated with remote control
6406741 but when the police rushed to the spot they were attacked
6406742 theres probably growing concern at the faa at the regulators across the world of whether the economic downturn in the aviation industry may be having some effect on maintenance
6406743 what we have done is to invite the german authorities to submit the draft legislation so that we can assess its compatibility with single market rules
6406744 we cannot comment on the draft law until we have analysed it
6406745 the measures would have to be looked at as regards the provision of the eu treaty regarding the free movement of capital as it is one of the fundamental principles of the treaty
6406746 the calf was in much worse condition than they originally thought and the injuries were a lot worse than they thought as well probably from a shark attack
6406747 we have taken the hard decision to put it down unfortunately
6406748 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6406749 you said youd give us a 24 hour stay of execution
6406750 this is certainly not what we would have hoped we would have hoped that the animal would have been ok

6406754 somos considerados ignorantes pelo mundo e at mesmo na igreja considerados
6406755 por parte daqueles que buscam a ind stria do corpo a dor antes de ser entendida como uma express o irrenunci vel da corporalidade passa a representar um obst culo a ser suportado superado ou inclusive tornado fonte de prazer
6406756 outra caracter stica que a dor e o sofrimento adquirem nesses ambientes de educa o do corpo vincula se a certo car ter legitimador a um

6406759 if you didnt know it you wouldnt think it was a plane
6406760 the plane burned i have seen a kilometer of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage
6406761 everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities at this difficult time
6406762 all around the gate i saw blood and human flesh people helped the injured and took them in their cars and even on motorbikes to the hospital
6406763 seven or eight people were already dead and another 10 people were breathing their last
6406764 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6406765 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6406766 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6406767 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6406768 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6406769 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6406770 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6406771 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6406772 what is scary is to produce a marriage line and then november comes and its recalled then we have thousands of dollars of inventory waiting
6406773 i told my brother all about you hes gonna love you only he better
6406774 according to the decision of the ioc lyudmila blonska has been removed from the start list for the womens long jump final
6406775 id like to see my husband for more than a day
6406776 it would be nice to walk in the door and say honey whats for dinner instead of having to make food for myself
6406777 i want to start a family and like kerri said were not in a rush to get back
6406778 everybody keeps bringing up 2012 but let us enjoy this one first
6406779 im not done and i hope misty isnt done yet either
6406780 what she did was special i dont think thats a record that will ever be broken you can say they are the best ever at beach volleyball
6406781 this is just another reason why we play in bathing suits may treanor said
6406782 i dreamt about rain last night it could have been 500 degrees or 500 below and wed be happy
6406783 the rain makes it better we felt like warriors out there
6406784 hay un gran n mero de factores geopol ticos de fondo como rusia e ir n
6406785 con 204 pa ses y territorios en los juegos ol mpicos se presentan muchas ocasiones en las que los atletas quieren hacer muestras p blicas de su respeto
6406786 el coi entiende esas necesidades y pedidos pero mantiene la posici n de que las demostraciones deben ser desalentadas en las sedes ol mpicas para que haya igualdad de condiciones para todos
6406787 de haber sabido que no estaba permitido no lo habr a hecho alguien podr a habernos dicho que no lo us ramos pero nadie dijo nada
6406788 ha habido peticiones de otros pa ses antes am rica por un entrenador que falleci aqu en un asesinato zambia por la muerte de su presidente y luego lo m s cruel que ha sido georgia rusia
6406789 en los tres casos los pa ses han hecho peticiones al coi y el coi tom la decisi n de que no se pondr a la bandera a media asta
6406790 a non sexual relationship between two men who are unusually close
6406791 is that the institutional church will only come to this deeper and richer understanding of human sexuality if it listens to the love stories of all the people to people for whom loving is their life
6406792 voices of married persons single people or the gay and lesbian community as well we not only need to expand our vision of sexuality but we also need to expand the inclusivity with which we listen to their stories
6406793 labor under messages that sexual mistakes even small ones are about the most offensive thing that one can engage in relationship to god
6406794 my personal belief is that these negative messages have to do with control and maintaining power
6406795 the patriarchal dominance in the hierarchy is incredibly strong and sexual mandates are a good way to scare and control people
6406796 for the many people who have moved beyond the belief that the hierarchy has the last word on whats right and wrong in sexuality
6406797 sexuality and spirituality really belong together sexuality is energy for relationships
6406798 children need to learn age appropriate sexual anatomy and physiology and prevention but id like to see it more in the context of relationships
6406799 we need to redesign rearticulate the whole theology of body touch body exploration
6406800 ordinary genital self touch can be very important and can help children come to reverence their bodies to know them
6406801 loving reverence in relationships how we stand before people and ourselves
6406802 y os contar algo que pas tambi n este funesto 20 de agosto en la trastienda me parece tan sorprendente y extra o que casi necesito hacerlo decirlo soltarlo quit rmelo de encima
6406803 when you go down to miami actually im not sure where in florida this place is be sure to go to they have bread that is to die for
6406804 whatever momentum obama took into the summer he really appears to have lost
6406805 its as if his campaign has stalled a little bit or coasted
6406806 but of course we then have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6406807 we supported him on impeachment its now his turn to support us on the reinstatement of judges
6406808 there were a lot of people who respected each other on both sides of the issue unfortunately it had a sad ending
6406809 but with a reconstituted board and some new members hopefully we can put the hospital system and the medical school back on track
6406810 deteriorated to a point where the future of both institutions is jeopardized
6406811 the governor has made appointments that he believes will serve the long term interests of the medical system and the doctors researchers students and support staff that have made the university of maryland medical system what it is today
6406812 when you pass that decision to someone in annapolis i dont think thats the best process
6406813 if you look at the history of medical systems across the country a huge number of failures come from a lack of independence on how you allocate capital
6406814 i feel like im in a volcano and the volcano is about to erupt
6406815 you listen to that scanner you think damn does it ever stop
6406816 theyre not trying to help the people who are poor or need help
6406817 you wont find anyone whos neutral on this in uptown
6406818 not to knock the service at all i mean its obviously a good service its got a huge following but i dont think craigslist is going to put us out of business and i mean obviously craigslist just dont have to worry about yk trader
6406819 id done up some posters with the tear off phone numbers
6406820 i thought to myself at the time there has to be a better way to do this
6406821 ive caught rides all over both canada and the u s a from the website
6406822 thirty to 40 000 increase because of the hebron deal
6406823 were starting to see the prices jump and what 150 000 could get you last year is not going to get you near this year
6406824 anybody in my view who wants to come to paradise i welcome them because were going to welcome them with open arms
6406825 were going to address the issues that we have and build a better town
6406826 were going to see activity ramp up in the next 18 to 24 months
6406827 the assembly of the project team by the operators some of the engineering work its going to start to have an impact fairly quickly
6406828 i mean this is the biggest thing weve seen in one project since hibernia days so its going to have a significant impact
6406829 en un accidente de estas caracter sticas es muy dif cil la identificaci n
6406830 un accidente a reo es una situaci n muy extrema y desagradable
6406831 who can claim a right to receive the body of christ
6406832 we can not ever say that we have the right to receive in the holy communion
6406833 has no intention to interfere in public life but in the spiritual state of the political or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law
6406834 unfortunately over the 80s and 90s there was always a kind of boundary heres hopkins and heres east baltimore we felt that this parcel could be that link that gateway for the community into hopkins
6406835 every time a shovel goes in the ground in the city it gives someone the confidence to say things are happening again lets get moving
6406836 we do not view what would be happening more than a half mile away as necessarily competitive to our efforts but i do think it behooves all of us that we do coordinate our respective efforts to ensure the future of east baltimore is a solid one
6406837 se un impianto sportivo fosse costruito da uno dei grani marchi dello sport come adidas e nike probabilmente non subirebbero gli atti di vandalismo che invece ci sono quando a fare il campo il comune di catania
6406838 the slowdown in the rise in mortgage interest cost was due more to a softening of new housing prices rather than to lower mortgage interest rates
6406839 he was a great sinner who became a great saint
6406840 after jesus and paul augustine of hippo is the most influential figure in the history of christianity
6406841 augustine entered both the church and the world as a revolutionary force and not merely created an epoch in the history of the church but determined the course of its history in the west up to the present day 1890s
6406842 its disgraceful that the pensions regulator is trying to put pressure on a member of the press in this way if we are to hold government bodies to account then a journalist must be able to protect their sources
6406843 there are numerous examples of injustice and malpractice that have only come to light because someone has blown the whistle to try to use a clause within the pensions act to undermine one of the basic principles of press freedom is simply outrageous
6406844 our goal in designing cruze was to be bold not evolutionary
6406845 we wanted to take a big step forward making a strong design statement for chevrolet products around the world
6406846 we are proud that europe is leading the introduction for this global product
6406847 chevrolet has always stood for expressive value and cruze delivers on that promise like never before it further redefines chevrolet with its design quality materials and great style inside and out the fit and finish for gaps and interfaces sets a new standard for this segment in europe and around the world
6406848 im going to be a fully involved chairman but im not going to be coming home at 10 oclock every night
6406849 im going to take summer fridays not go into the office every day and im not going to stay past 5 p m
6406850 i got down to my beloved 200 acre farm and after a day and a half i discovered that i hated it
6406851 i was doing 100 hour workweeks even though my health is excellent i dont think that would have continued and i have a new wife who is not happy theres been no honeymoon ive had no vacation
6406852 loyalty sentiment commitment they dont care about any of that stuff its all about performance
6406853 quadrangle may want more hands on urgency in terms of taking the business to the next level
6406854 tambi n nos han faltado jugadores importantes y eso siempre se nota en un equipo pero no creo que fuera tampoco para que nos metieran cinco goles

6406870 1 when establishing a new community 2 when introducing a new ritual and 3 when a normally secular space was to be used for a temporary ritual event
6406871 notions of ritual space and patterns of behaviour within such spaces seem to be intrinsic to individual aspiration and collective resolution as sectarian groups organize means of rationalizing life and death
6406872 to phrase it another way ritual spaces serve as locales of forced dynamics in which spatial cues trigger a series of concepts and events directed at the hope of achieving an aspired goal
6406873 personal communal and spiritual intentions and purposes and their sacred connection are reaffirmed

6406883 the whole acting troupe participates in the public offerings that accompany the temple festival

6406885 a religious chant sung and danced by a chorus of some fifty make celebrants in honour of the god dionysus
6406886 constructed in alternating rhythms and patterns of a ritualistic nature
6406887 symbolic rituals the sublimation of an action rather than the life like representation of it the characters larger than life the speech rhythmic and sometimes hypnotic in its effect
6406888 1 tragedy is in origin a sacer ludus a ritual dance representing normally the aition or the supposed historical cause of some current ritual practice
6406889 faith in the gods began to give way to scepticism patriotism and idealism degenerated into materialism
6406890 religious ritual was the drama of the early christian middle ages
6406891 these performances reinforced shiite popular beliefs as well as strengthening an iranian religious identity

6407070 houston is doing better than most of the country mostly due to energy
6407071 weve been affected by the effects of the real estate crisis in the last 12 months the difference between houston and the rest of the country is that we are holding up against the storm compared to the rest of the nation
6407072 houston is fortunate in that it has been on much stronger footing than many other markets around the country
6407073 thats due largely to the fact that the flourishing energy industry makes up a huge part of the regions economic base
6407074 this area also did not experience the pricing bubble that created bloated home values in areas like california and florida which are now hurting

6407343 we are arriving at huixinxijie nankou station please get ready for your arrival
6407344 die vielzahl der tarife und sonderaktionen sorgt nicht zwangsl ufig f r mehr wechselbereitschaft beim kunden viele kunden bleiben lieber ihrem anbieter treu als sich mit dem tarifwirrwarr auseinanderzusetzen
6407345 da helfen auch die t glichen call center attacken der tk anbieter nicht weiter um den kunden mit halbseidenen angeboten zu berrumpeln und ihm teure vertr ge aufzuschwatzen das f hrt im endergebnis noch zu einer h heren ver rgerung der verbraucher
6407346 die praxis zeigt dass es vielen tk unternehmen nicht gelingt ihren werbespr chen gerecht zu werden sie schlagen sich anscheinend lieber in ihre kundendienst abteilungen mit den auswirkungen und symptomen schlecht konzipierter produkte und services herum und bet tigen sich in der brandbek mpfung ohne die ursachen wirklich zu beheben
6407347 besonders bei den festnetzanbietern bekommt man zuweilen den eindruck dass sie alles tun um m glichst viele servicevorf lle zu generieren
6407348 all das f hrt schnell zu kundenfrust mitarbeiter sind oftmals nicht in der lage ein problem am telefon zu l sen da sie lediglich f r einfache ausk nfte die so genannten faqs geschult sind und ber keine oder geringe vollmachten verf gen um ein kundenanliegen schnell und unb rokratisch zu l sen
6407349 diese mehrfach kontakte werden dann zum echten problem wenn anfragen ber unterschiedliche eingangskan le nicht einem vorgang zugeordnet werden k nnen diese f higkeit besitzen leider die wenigsten unternehmen zudem gibt es oftmals keine ad quate m glichkeit einfache vorg nge schnell selbst zu erledigen wer es gewohnt ist seine fl ge online zubuchen den telefonischen quick check in bevorzugt und sitzplatzreservieren per sms liebt der hat wenig spa bei den meisten angeboten der telefonfirmen zur selbstadministration per telefon oder im internet
6407350 es spricht einiges daf r dass hnlich wie bei den fluggesellschaften gut gemachte self service angebote auch angenommen werden die anzahl der kundenanfragen sinkt und damit die kunden zufriedenheit steigt
6407351 nach unseren studien sind die datentarife f r die nutzung des mobilen internets ein wesentlicher hemmschuh f r dessen weitere verbreitung studiert man das kleingedruckte vermeintlicher flatrate angebote der betreiber so findet man dort in viele f llen limitierungen im datenvolumen bei deren berschreiten entweder die kosten exponentiell ansteigen oder in anderen f llen die nutzungsbandbreite reduziert wird
6407352 gleiches gilt f r datenverbindungen im ausland bei denen exorbitante kosten entstehen k nnen wenn man beispielsweise im auslandsnetz vergisst die regelm ige synchronisation zu deaktivieren und im rhythmus von f nf minuten f r jede einzelnen verbindungsaufbau kr ftig zur kasse gebeten wird mit einer derartigen preispolitik werden die wachstumsphantasien der netzbetreiber sicherlich nicht aufgehen

6407462 irregular warfare the nonkinetic solutions some whole of government approaches but particularly looking at the notion of information dominance in the battle space and things that we can do with our interagency partners to achieve effects without necessarily totally leaning on
6407463 this is a very long term strategy that we must be engaged in and it runs the gamut from just counter terrorism to counter crime to however you want to look at it
6407464 threads of violent actors that range across the scope of terrorist actors to just international organized criminals to i think narco terrorists or drug traders and then in some cases just basic gangs thieves and thugs that can come together and represent a very formidable threat to our region for a number of reasons
6407465 these are not necessarily you know standing organized armies that wear uniforms like we all envision warfare to be
6407466 it takes a different kind of tactic in terms of countering disrupting and defeating this kind of threat
6407467 if were going to establish a security line of operation in afghanistan then obviously from that you dont necessarily get security if you cant resolve the economic and agricultural conundrum of what is the money maker well its the poppy product so a strategy has got to deal with that
6407468 what do we do the military does not necessarily do that but what can we do to establish desired strategic objectives that the interagency could step up to with maybe department of agriculture us agency for international development and state department to do that what can nato do to also help influence that
6407469 afghanistan is a different battle space than iraq so the lessons of iraq may or may not work in afghanistan
6407470 the situation is much different the people are much different the dynamics are much different so still a lot of work to be done in afghanistan
6407471 long term endeavor to engage at a strategic level to do those things across all of the many areas of need that would need to be done

6407707 this brochure offers useful information on how eye allergies occur common signs and symptoms and practical advice on how to treat and prevent eye allergies

6407710 single use daily disposable contacts enable contact lens wearers to continue use throughout the allergy season
6407711 studies have shown that single use contacts daily disposable lenses that you throw away at the end of the day can be a healthy and more comfortable option for many people with eye allergies by putting in a clean fresh lens every day one day contacts minimize the potential for accumulation of allergens and irritants that can often accumulate with repeated use of the same pair of lenses

6407716 its a very different map than what weve looked at in the past were looking at states like alaska and georgia odd places for those of us who have been stuck in the map of the polarized american politics
6407717 i think its pretty clear that obama has his own set of strengths and his own set of weaknesses that make his candidacy not just historical but fairly unique
6407718 thats why this race is so close nationally despite the political environment totally going his way the fact this is a very close race nationally underscores challenges obama faces and not being seen as a leader
6407719 what he had to do to win the nomination has lost him a great deal on the other hand obama does have important advantages on bringing the right kind of change being on your side restoring our respect in the world those are also important presidential attributes
6407720 toward the beginning of this thing i was thinking if a republican was going to win i wish it was him
6407721 he was probably the best candidate i had but after ive seen all this other stuff and his campaigning is bothersome too ive lost almost all respect for him
6407722 just uh when obama talks he doesnt really say what he stands for you think mccain tells you what he really thinks yes
6407723 were spending too much money and too many people are dying that shouldnt be dying
6407724 this election is about two people if you go back to 1988 and look at the selection of dan quayle it was a major media firestorm at the time but proved not to be that significant in terms of how people voted
6407725 ultimately this is going to come down to the debates and how people judge mccain and obama against each other
6407726 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6407727 whether you were a presidential candidate a colleague debating on the floor or a friend passing time you wanted her on your team for her quick legal mind tenacious debating skills her infectious humor and that thousand watt smile my heart is heavy
6407728 you would be absolutely psychotic not to sit down and absorb this and not move forward
6407729 youll be able to live work and play here like the early villages in the united states
6407730 my friends who are very pro urban see high gas prices as a terrific boost to urban living
6407731 im not so sure as a culture weve bought into the notion of spreading out were going to do our darndest to make it work
6407732 youre going to have to change your diet youre going to have to lose weight exercise stop smoking
6407733 if its not an important priority keep doing what youre doing ill give you the pills but if you really want to be there youre going to have to change
6407734 id been using medications in these patients they were hopefully following my recommendations
6407735 we still couldnt get their blood pressure under control and i was somewhat skeptical that meditation could be the key to blood pressure control
6407736 it was a foreign concept in terms of my normal practices
6407737 their blood pressure dropped and they dropped some of their medication it was striking it was statistically significant but more important it was clinically significant to these people
6407738 its basically a plumbing problem youre pushing the same amount of blood through a bigger pipe
6407739 and thats what nitric oxide which all of us make in our body does in response to relaxation response
6407740 to play in full screen mode i got it working and then had to wrap up so lets just agree that my return to pc gaming is occurring more like a slow walk into the shallow side of the pool than a platform dive

6407750 its been a wrong decision not to sell spanair for a very long time
6407751 spanair has been up for sale for almost a year and a half but sas have apparently been unable to get the price they wanted and the further they got into the process the worse the situation has got
6407752 the interim government should have attended to account to forum leaders
6407753 i have absolutely no idea whether that makes any sense from a scientific from a practical point of view
6407754 are you going to put a big windmill on top of the empire state building i think thats very unlikely
6407755 can you put windmills off the coastline that is highly likely
6407756 i can seriously imagine offshore wind farms but in terms of actually urban turbines in manhattan we are a ways off from that
6407757 windmills are no panacea for our problems they can help just like biofuels can help just like tides can help
6407758 in the end it is conservation that is the main thing you and i can do and that we can do in this city

6407773 undertakings given at the 2007 forum in tonga to hold an election by march 2009

6407775 secondly for the first time the leaders of the pacific islands forum have embraced the possibility of suspension of a member state to be adopted against fiji should they continue not to embrace their undertakings for march 2009 elections
6407776 organism som har ndrats p ett s tt som inte sker naturligt genom parning eller naturlig rekombination
6407777 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe can be done whats feasible
6407778 obviously everybody is going to keep an eye on conditions on the ground
6407779 det viktiga r att allt vi gjorde skedde i enlighet med vad s kerhetsf reskrifterna f reskriver i fall som dessa
6407780 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet
6407781 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6407782 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6407783 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure
6407784 son when you grow up would you be the saviour of the broken the beaten and the damned

6407790 for as long as we coddle blacks for slavery hows that
6407791 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6407792 you have had your day in which your woolly thinking has messed up not just the western world but the whole planet which could if homo sapiens had been truly intelligent have supported a small population enjoying a wonderful quality of life almost for ever you have thrown away that opportunity
6407793 probably before 2010 uncontrollable inflation and recession will spread round the world
6407794 and hopefully voters will give us a chance to improve facilities by voting in favor of a bond issue
6407795 there are still a couple of issues that were wrestling with but that 135 million figure is correct as of the end of wednesday afternoon
6407796 tomorrow 8 checkpoints will be established in the security zone in which 500 peacekeepers will be deployed no more than that
6407797 other peacekeepers will be moved to south ossetia while other troops will be moved to russia
6407798 i want to state this clearly and unequivocally that russia is carrying out in full the six principles agreed between medvedev and sarkozy
6407799 these principles allow the russian peacekeepers to take additional measures to ensure security in the security zone
6407800 there is still work to be done to finally adjust the shape of the security zone this work will be completed tomorrow
6407801 so whats going on here how can people in groups be both brilliant and idiotic one word interface

6407816 im getting excited its a good atmosphere here in beijing
6407817 for a change gasoline prices were not a major factor rising a moderate 1 2 per cent in the month and set to fall heavily in august though they were still up 28 6 per y y instead an 8 8 per cent pop in natural gas prices was the big factor driving energy prices in the month
6407818 this report offers no big surprises which is a good thing in light of the high side shocks seen in many other cpi releases around the world in recent months and while headline inflation is now running at its fastest pace in more than five years it is still near the bottom of the pack globally and more than two points below the current u s pace
6407819 this is certainly the most unusual thing i have come across during my 10 years as a lifeboatman

6407828 i am confident that we have selected an outstanding youth games team to compete in pune with the standards continuing to rise with every games cycle
6407829 whilst winning medals is important the major benefit of the commonwealth youth games is exposing young athletes to this level of competition in a multi sport environment

6407862 all of us are just really sad and down about it

6407879 the picnic is an attempt to reclaim public space alcohol bans are the result of a top down bureaucratic definition of public space and an over the top response to perceived antisocial behaviour and social breakdown
6407880 the longer these bans are imposed the more each of us refuse to take responsibility for public space and stop resolving our own issues leading to a more antisocial society this is not a campaign for drunkenness its for the public right to engage in our own space
6407881 the police should be concerned with people breaking the law not with these so called preventative measures cultural issues are not solved with blanket bans but by political and social engagement for which we need a vibrant public sphere
6407882 we want to raise awareness and are expecting to attract people who are annoyed at this fundamental civil liberties issue

6407884 residents in communities around the country rate this is as one of the issues theyd most like to see dealt with
6407885 the aim of these powers is not to criminalise drinkers or drink itself but rather to give police added enforcement powers to seize alcohol from those posing a nuisance to those around you they are only a potential option and in most cases tend to employed in a limited targeted manner after it has been established that a specific area poses particular problems for the community

6407891 its a very different map than what weve looked at in the past were looking at states like alaska and georgia odd places for those of us who have been stuck in the map of the polarized american politics
6407892 i think its pretty clear that obama has his own set of strengths and his own set of weaknesses that make his candidacy not just historical but fairly unique
6407893 thats why this race is so close nationally despite the political environment totally going his way the fact this is a very close race nationally underscores challenges obama faces and not being seen as a leader
6407894 what he had to do to win the nomination has lost him a great deal on the other hand obama does have important advantages on bringing the right kind of change being on your side restoring our respect in the world those are also important presidential attributes
6407895 toward the beginning of this thing i was thinking if a republican was going to win i wish it was him
6407896 he was probably the best candidate i had but after ive seen all this other stuff and his campaigning is bothersome too ive lost almost all respect for him
6407897 just uh when obama talks he doesnt really say what he stands for you think mccain tells you what he really thinks yes
6407898 were spending too much money and too many people are dying that shouldnt be dying
6407899 this election is about two people if you go back to 1988 and look at the selection of dan quayle it was a major media firestorm at the time but proved not to be that significant in terms of how people voted
6407900 ultimately this is going to come down to the debates and how people judge mccain and obama against each other
6407901 we were all standing around the counter bullshitting when we were supposed to be writing songs and getting work done

6407937 contribute to negative coverage of the country in the international media in the run up to both events
6407938 if you add up the location fees film crews are expected to pay up to r25 000 per day
6407939 in many instances the film crews are in johannesburg to film promotional films of the citys key attractions in the run up to the confederations cup and the 2010 fifa world cup
6407940 over and above the location fees crews also need to pay r450 an hour for filming on public roads to these crews it understandably feels as if the city is doing them a favour and not the other way around
6407941 the result is that even london and new york seem to offer more value a scenario that will have a negative impact on the country
6407942 the interest is particularly around 2010 stadiums transport infrastructure host cities hospitality and accommodation services leisure amenities and visitor attractions
6407943 as many of these film shoots are for travel magazines and shows from some of the provinces key international tourism markets this provides a valuable opportunity for the city and the tourism industry to market both its public and privately owned tourism attractions to the world in the run up to 2010
6407944 we have raised these concerns with the city and the tourism industry and have stressed the importance of ensuring uninhibited access by film and television crews to our visitor attractions

6407946 most six sigma and lean training is based around thinking from 20 years ago based on successes in motorola and ge we wanted to take an up to the minute look at what makes a successful programme today
6407947 as the use of the lean six sigma methodology and tools are growing quickly researching its success factors is important to make sure that lean six sigma is not misused and so continues to have a high positive impact
6407948 lean six sigma practice has enormous potential to improve business performance how the training of professionals in tools and success factors takes place and the implementation of these in practice is currently an under researched area it should be a concern of all leading researchers and training organisations in this area to ensure that it is performed correctly in order to maximise its impact
6407949 i think practitioners are more critical and focus not only on how well the deployment is accepted but also on how well their internal processes are working eg project selection review sessions bb development etc
6407950 sponsors on the other hand are happy to see positive results and focus less on the process side
6407951 when the general electric heuristic for making initiatives work e q x a effectiveness of the programme is a function of its technical quality times its cultural acceptance is considered it can be seen that there is a fairly even split between cultural and technical factors this implies that the people aspects of any improvement programme are as important as the technical tools and techniques used this is why we at sigmapro spend a lot of time in our training on change management
6407952 in my experience they are often reluctant to do this
6407953 and this has a significant negative impact on initiative success

6407978 eu achava que os meus pais implicavam com ele por ser o meu primeiro namorado firme mas aos poucos percebi que n o era exatamente isso o preconceito velado foi se tornando cada vez mais expl cito e insuport vel
6407979 eles diziam que o fato de a filha ter escolhido um namorado pobre era at aceit vel mas mulato j era demais netinhos negros nem pensar como se ser humano tivesse pedigree
6407980 era bem dif cil porque os meus amigos tamb m diziam que n o ia dar certo que a diferen a era muito grande que a gente n o ia ter papo que depois de passada a qu mica de pele n o sobraria mais nada cheguei at a ouvir que o mateus era interesseiro que queria o status de namorar uma menina rica e branca

6407983 por medo de ter que ag entar mais e mais julgamentos cheguei at a esconder o mateus de pessoas que ainda n o o conheciam
6407984 ele dizia que me amava mas que n o queria me ver em p de guerra com o mundo inteiro lembro exatamente das palavras dele n o quero mais que a gente seja invis vel acho que isso sim faria a gente n o dar certo ent o decidi enfrentar o preconceito de uma vez por todas
6407985 quando apareci de m os dadas com o mateus na casa dos meus tios foi um choque geral lembro dos olhares de espanto at hoje
6407986 eu estava t o nervosa que nem lembro direito o que eu falei mas garanti que estava muito feliz se ia dar certo nem eu nem ele sab amos mas eu disse que achava que merec amos tentar chorei muito meus pais viram que eu estava sofrendo

6408004 mein gehalt hat sich um rund 60 prozent gesteigert schon w hrend meines studiums habe ich meine stelle gewechselt vom reinen produktingenieur bin ich ins entwicklungsmanagement aufgestiegen meine heutige arbeit umfasst sowohl technische aspekte als auch human resource management marketing sowie projekt und account management
6408005 als ich bei der ou business school anfing arbeitete ich als rechnungspr fer inzwischen bin ich vom junior projektmanager zum programmmanager bis zum abteilungsleiter aufgestiegen ich glaube dass ich mindestens die h lfte meines beruflichen erfolgs den kenntnissen verdanke die ich mir im studium an der ou angeeignet habe
6408006 das studium an der ou business school war f r mich eine wertvolle erfahrung ich nutze das wissen t glich bei meiner arbeit die drei akkreditierungen sind inzwischen bei fast allen personalern bekannt so dass ein studium an der ou auch bei jobwechsel als erstklassige qualifikation angef hrt werden kann
6408007 unser berufsbegleitendes mba studium zeichnet aus dass studierende direkt aus ihrem aktuellen beruflichen alltag reale fallbeispiele einbringen m ssen l sungen erarbeiten und in der praxis gleich anwenden wobei sie sich vorher interaktiv mit ihren tutoren und internationalen studienkollegen austauschen k nnen
6408008 als beruflich und privat stark eingespannter familienvater fand ich es klasse dass man bei der ou zehn jahre zeit hat sein mba studium in ruhe zu beenden und das wo immer man wohnt
6408009 als selbst ndiger unternehmensberater stellte sich f r mich nicht die frage nach einer beruflichen ver nderung
6408010 der mba titel hat bei der akquisition neuer kunden gewiss nicht geschadet viel wichtiger f r mich war aber ein frischer 360 blick auf aktuelle wissenschaftliche konzepte und methoden allen die sich hnlich wie ich als berater spezialisieren m ssen kann ich eine solche ausbildung zur erweiterung des horizonts nur empfehlen
6408011 mein mba hat mir geholfen mich pers nlich weiterzuentwickeln und selbstbewusster mit den vorst nden meines ehemaligen arbeitgebers zu kommunizieren insbesondere die f higkeit mir selbst und anderen an den richtigen stellen zum richtigen zeitpunkt die richtigen fragen zu stellen das habe ich gelernt
6408012 mir hat der mba viel gebracht also auf keinen fall ein salto nullo aber ich bin auch kein hochspringer

6408053 there is going to be a void of 4 million for equipment

6408055 thats a lot of money its now a 2 billion project
6408056 they were just explaining the 2 billion plan nobody said they wanted the spend 2 billion

6408063 people dont get married to suffer psychological and emotional trauma they marry in order to be happy
6408064 and they divorce for the same reason to get away from what is making them miserable and to have a chance at being happy
6408065 most people dont see divorce as something desirable but they do see it as the only option for them to be happy
6408066 but this is one of the great myths of divorce namely it will make you happy
6408067 certainly there are times when a divorce may be the best option
6408068 at this point it can only be said there are many marriages that experience serious problems but survive and eventually prosper
6408069 marriage is often both the most satisfying and the most frustrating relationship that an individual can experience
6408070 however the prevailing myth that divorce is the best option for the unhappily married is now being debunked by the research it seems the unlikely road to happiness for unhappily married adults is to keep working at it

6408072 without a doubt this special review will uncover what we already know that the eclipse 500 marks the safest new airplane introduction into service in 20 years
6408073 customer safety has always been a priority at eclipse and we look forward to this investigation dispelling any inaccuracies about the certification of this airplane for once and for all
6408074 the question is whether faa did what its supposed to do in certifying this jet
6408075 typically faa managers dont make a move unless you have a cadre of engineers willing to approve a design
6408076 they were telling the pilots to inspect the throttle quadrants but they arent engineers it was like telling them to do something for the sake of it doing it

6408132 im really disappointed that the number of retailers selling alcohol to minors has doubled in the last year
6408133 ministers should focus on ensuring that the current drinking age is enforced rather than pursuing an alcohol policy that will demonise all 18 to 20 year olds as irresponsible drinkers
6408134 a statement from the respondents that it will undertake a review of the terms of the present moa or will renegotiate its terms is not tantamount to a commitment that they will not sign the same
6408135 the slippery slope respondents seek to make this court take will render this court inutile and on a path of irrelevance similar to the path that the martial law court took
6408136 thus any announcement by the respondents that they will desist from signing the moa does not mean that the executive will not desist from signing other agreements of similar terms clearly such action on the part of the executive is capable of repetition
6408137 its been three years and eight months they studied it and scheduled the signing and then they cancel everything what is that

6408159 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6408160 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6408161 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6408162 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6408163 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in

6408183 we are not in the business of encouraging or condoning mis selling or inappropriate sales in any way whatsoever and we stamp on that when we find it because it is completely inappropriate behaviour for a bank

6408200 the quality of cold calling in general insurance sales was disappointing
6408201 consumers were pressurised and the benefits of the product were sometimes exaggerated

6408230 the base oil market is very tight now refineries are producing diesel not base oil

6408241 the government required gasoline and gas oil production in 2004 and 2005
6408242 there is lots of government focus on cleaner fuels but not so much focus on higher quality lubricants and base oils

6408249 a man was going down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among robbers and they stripped him and beat him and went away leaving him half dead and by chance a priest was going down on that road and when he saw him he passed by on the other side likewise a levite also when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side but a samaritan who was on a journey came upon him and when he saw him he felt compassion and came to him and bandaged up his wounds pouring oil and wine on them and he put him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him on the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said take care of him and whatever more you spend when i return i will repay you which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell into the robbers hands

6408255 shell and bp have a significant presence in this segment as well amongst the majors there are a lot of the smaller niche players active in certain countries markets as well but overall the big three are well poised to take advantage of the growth opportunity in addition shell might be thinking of this with reference to their gtl play
6408256 high oil prices make todays economic environment especially challenging however developments such as the shift toward synthetics and growing demand in emerging markets create real opportunities for the lubricants industry
6408257 apart from that there are various small niche players that enjoyed growth
6408258 volume wise asia is going to be the growth engine of the future and china and india in particular with demand declining in western europe and north america being essentially flat
6408259 automotive is certainly big and then there is growth in power generation manufacturing textiles food processing and construction
6408260 with high gas prices consumer automotive is negatively impacted but with the weakened dollar our goods manufactured here are well received in the rest of the world
6408261 just when you think oil is going to take a serious dive it rallies by 5 or more the next day
6408262 we really see oil natural gas and coal remaining predominant through the timeframe
6408263 there will be steps taken to mitigate some of that growth especially in developing countries but some of the growth in developing countries where countries are looking at the most economic options will continue to turn to that
6408264 our view maybe the bottom line is we see a lot more energy demand out to 2030 about 40 percent higher than in 2005 and about 30 percent more than today
6408265 in 1980 it took over two and a half barrels of oil equivalent energy to generate 1 000 of economic output
6408266 today its somewhere around two barrels by 2030 we expect that to be somewhere around one and a half barrels or 50 percent lower than where it was in about 1980 we expect a lot more efficient technology to come in and help make energy demand and growth moderate
6408267 we expect it to grow about 1 3 percent to 2030 slower than it has been historically
6408268 that reflects some of the energy efficiencies that weve built into the outlook
6408269 over time that ramped up not because theres more oil but because we have new technology that could get to that oil and develop it economically
6408270 so today the usgs is estimating about 3 3 trillion barrels recoverable close to our own estimate which is about 3 6 trillion barrels that is conventional crude
6408271 so we think theres adequate resources out there to support the growth going forward out to 2030 and beyond
6408272 weve actually boosted our outlook from about 2 million barrels per day in 2030 up to about 3 million barrels per day
6408273 we do see it contributing more although it only provides about 3 percent of our liquid fuels demand
6408274 opec crudes about 30 million barrels per day today and we expect theyll continue to ramp production up to about 45 or 50 million barrels per day by 2030
6408275 and since then it really began to ramp up and we expect it to grow rapidly
6408276 we dont see a lot of nuclear builds between now and then
6408277 what we see over time is when a country reaches about 1 000 per capita income the vehicle penetration begins to pay off because more people can afford to buy a car

6408289 block box file the official flight data recorded from flight 77 its a digital record of everything that happened on that flight from take off additionally altitude and position are confirmed by the beacon at nearby reagan national airport
6408290 after take off flight 77 never went below 273 ft
6408291 its physically impossible for the plane flight 77 to have caused the damage to the building pentagon
6408292 during the time that the airplane was coming into the pentagon there was a young man who would come in and say to the vice president the plane is 50 miles out the plane is 30 miles out
6408293 of course the orders still stand have you heard anything to the contrary former transportation secretary norman mineta 911 commission hearing
6408294 its easy to imagine an infinite number of situations where the government might legitimately give out false information
6408295 there is no question there is no doubt what happened that day and i think its appalling that anyone might try to put out that kind of myth i think its also appalling for anyone to continue to give those sorts of people any kind of publicity
6408296 to even suggest that aa77 did not crash into the pentagon on september 11 is the ultimate insult to the memory of the 59 men women and children on aa77 and the 125 dedicated military and civilian workers in the pentagon who were ruthlessly murdered by terrorists on september 11

6408495 die verbesserung der konjunkturerwartungen signalisiert dass sich die bef rchtungen der finanzmarktexperten ber die konjunkturelle abschw chung in grenzen halten die finanzmarktexperten haben sich von der negativen zuwachsrate im zweiten quartal zu recht nicht sonderlich beeindrucken lassen insgesamt gehen sie von einer zwar schw cheren aber alles in allem robusten konjunkturentwicklung aus und bef rchten naheliegenderweise keine rezession
6408496 die deutsche finanzbranche gibt sich verhalten optimistisch der zew index f r die mittelfristige konjunkturerwartung steigt st rker als erwartet
6408497 es gibt drei faktoren die das wachstum in deutschland d mpfen das ist einmal die internationale finanzkrise die immer noch nicht ausgestanden ist zum zweiten sind es die hohen energiepreise die investitionen und konsum belasten und der dritte faktor ist das ende des mehrj hrigen weltweiten aufschwungs
6408498 aber auch die bundesregierung kann etwas gegen den abschwung tun
6408499 die deutsche wirtschaft ist im zweiten quartal 2008 zum ersten mal seit knapp vier jahren wieder geschrumpft um 0 5 war das bruttoinlandsprodukt niedriger als im ersten quartal 2008 waren f r die wirtschaftsentwicklung im zweiten quartal r ckl ufige konsumausgaben der privaten haushalte und geringere anlageinvestitionen kennzeichnend positive impulse kamen vom au enhandel was aber vor allem auf einen signifikanten r ckgang der importe zur ckzuf hren ist
6408500 lag das bruttoinlandsprodukt bip im zweiten quartal 2008 preis kalender und saisonbereinigt um 0 5 prozent niedriger als im vorquartal im vorjahresvergleich stieg das bip im zweiten quartal hingegen um real 3 1 prozent kalenderbereinigt um 1 7 prozent
6408501 der bundeswirtschaftsminister verweist darauf dass die wirtschaft von april bis juni im vorjahresvergleich kalenderbereinigt um 1 7 prozent gewachsen ist real sogar um 3 1 prozent
6408502 ist das wachstum ber das ganze erste halbjahr betrachtet in eine moderate aufw rtsentwicklung eingeschwenkt
6408503 eine technische gegenreaktion zum auch witterungsbedingt berzeichneten guten ersten quartal war allgemein erwartet worden
6408504 aber durch die anpassungsleistung der betriebe und arbeitnehmer sowie die wirtschafts und finanzpolitischen reformen hat sich die internationale wettbewerbsf higkeit und widerstandskraft der deutschen wirtschaft gegen ber weltwirtschaftlichen risiken und belastungen ein gutes st ck verbessert
6408505 nach einer schw cheren entwicklung zum jahresende 2007 hat das wachstum in den ersten monaten dieses jahres erfreulicherweise wieder deutlich fahrt aufgenommen die sich festigende binnenkonjunktur wirkt den gestiegenen unsicherheiten im internationalen umfeld entgegen und st rkt so die wachstumsperspektiven
6408506 nach der k nstlichen aufh bschung der ergebnisse riecht es f r das 2 quartal umso mehr nach rezession
6408507 umsatz im verarbeitenden gewerbe im juni 2008 real 1 5 zum vorjahr
6408508 nach einer schw cheren entwicklung zum jahresende 2007 hat das wachstum in den ersten monaten dieses jahres erfreulicherweise wieder deutlich fahrt aufgenommen die sich festigende binnenkonjunktur wirkt den gestiegenen unsicherheiten im internationalen umfeld entgegen und st rkt so die wachstumsperspektiven

6408511 der vergleichsweise hohe anstieg der tarifverdienste ist vor allem auf die bereits bis einschlie lich januar 2008 wirksam gewordenen tariferh hungen zur ckzuf hren seither stiegen die tarifverdienste im durchschnitt lediglich um 0 7
6408512 tarifl hne steigen so stark wie seit zw lf jahren nicht

6408526 youre running in as fast as you can and stopping pretty much on the spot and youve got to build your energy and your psyche up to do that and it takes a bit of guts to do it

6408597 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6408664 showing absolutely no indication theyre going to stop enriching uranium
6408665 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks iran is a threat not only to israel but this is a global threat
6408666 any kind of hesitation is being perceived by the iranians as weakness
6408667 you dont even give them 15 months necessarily you think its a more urgent matter
6408668 t he world cannot afford a nuclear iran and weapons of mass destruction everywhere in this region in the hands not only of states but also of terrorist organizations
6408669 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6408670 responsible financial institutions and businesses worldwide are taking steps to avoid doing business with iranian nuclear and missile entities as well as with the front companies and cut outs the iranian regime uses to disguise its activities
6408671 these five nuclear and missile entities have been used by iran to hide its illicit conduct and further its dangerous nuclear ambitions
6408672 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
6408673 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
6408674 they are likely to use any bomb they build both because of ideology and because of fear of israeli nuclear pre emption thus an israeli nuclear strike to prevent the iranians from taking the final steps toward getting the bomb is probable the alternative is letting tehran have its bomb in either case a middle eastern nuclear holocaust would be in the cards
6408675 the issue with iran is not about uranium enrichment it wants to control the region
6408676 the reason for this is that they do not want people to panic
6408677 if there is a nuclear leak from one of irans nuclear reactors we need to have stockpiled iodine
6408678 kuwait must have emergency medical teams ready to deal with such situations who are equipped with supplies ready in all areas of kuwait who are ready to deal with every contingency
6408679 stockpile food and have alternative routes to import food into kuwait
6408680 kuwait would need to procure more trucks for this purpose
6408681 this would require oil tankers equipped to travel in shallow water during the tanker war this was done and proved to be very expensive
6408682 it was successful to maintain the flow of kuwaiti oil but expensive
6408683 powerful forces have historically attempted to control trade via this point
6408684 so they could control traffic through the gulf iran has had this intention since 1971
6408685 the maneuvers that have been carried out recently are held one after another to keep our armed forces prepared and strong fortunately these exercises have shown our great defensive capabilities to the world
6408686 security is a national issue the people expect our courageous armed forces to take even the slightest threats seriously
6408687 what we are talking about here are threats from outside the region
6408688 to all my arab brothers and sisters in neighboring countries i must say that our security is your security and your security is ours
6408689 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6408690 reserves the right to take whatever action it deems necessary
6408691 would give iran international legitimacy for its programme which it currently lacks
6408692 the americans are not ready to allow us to attack iran
6408693 our position is that no option is to be taken off the table but in the meantime we have to make diplomatic progress
6408694 it would not be right to talk about these things
6408695 threat to the whole world order and there are many actions to be made in the realm of intelligence and preventive measures
6408696 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment
6408697 israel supports international efforts to place pressure on the regime in tehran to cease nuclear enrichment its time for the international community to send a clear message to the iranian leadership only if diplomacy is exercised seriously will diplomacy succeed
6408698 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
6408699 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
6408700 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
6408701 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilization development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behavior in scapegoating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq
6408702 the continuation of the presence of foreign forces in the country and certain wring policies and practices on the part of foreign forces there
6408703 there is a mechanism which is agreed between iraq and these countries on what these countries can do through the meeting of interior ministers of these countries through the expanded neighboring countries conferences which took place in kuwait and anther one that is going to take place in jordan in fall
6408704 we are going to continue these negotiations through diplomatic channels
6408705 we hope that any improvement in the relationship between iran and the u s will help the situation in iraq
6408706 it is noteworthy that despite these groundless allegations to date no single credible evidence has ever been presented to substantiate them
6408707 to the contrary several high ranking iraqi officials are on record stressing irans constructive role in the country and rejecting the solid allegation
6408708 the united states accuses iran because the two countries have as yet not resolved their outstanding disputes
6408709 the accusation is designed to stem irans rising regional influence which the u s itself helped to enhance by overthrowing two of the islamic republics most implacable enemies the taliban and saddam hussein regimes
6408710 in addition during these operations numerous jish al mahdi militia fighters and leaders of jish al mahdi associated highly trained special groups fled to iran where they received sanctuary
6408711 as far as the u s is concerned the accusation has the advantage of undermining irans image in the eyes of iraqi shiites by blaming iran for the nefarious activities of the discredited elements in the mahdi army
6408712 the allegations are also designed to provide credence for americas narrative that depicts iran as a deceitful untrustworthy and hypocritical power which while professing to support the central government in baghdad trains funds and arms iraqi prime minister nouri enemies
6408713 irans role in iraq is a byproduct of u s iran relations
6408714 when u s iran relations have stalled irans role in iraq would likely be unconstructive and when u s iran relations are cooperative then irans role in iraq might be cooperative it doesnt necessarily mean that the u s has to pull out from iraq
6408715 the security situation has improved not simply because of the surge but because of a host of other factors including the successful completion of ethnic cleansing in key areas and americas success in buying off former sunni insurgents
6408716 economic conditions the improving performance of the iraqi military the decision on the part of iran to lend greater support to the iraqi central government instead of shiite militias as well as blunders on the part of al qaeda and setbacks suffered by moqtada al sadr
6408717 theres ongoing cooperation between us on missile defense but theres nothing new on that
6408718 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6408719 we will protect our land and territorial waters with all our might
6408720 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

6408734 irans role in iraq is a by product of u s iran relations

6408738 justifications and pretexts for those us and israel who want to drag the region down a dangerous slope
6408739 who didnt adequately refute claims over iraqs supposed weapons of mass destruction
6408740 israel must on no account attack iran speak of attacking iran or even think about it

6408788 i am just at the weight but because of where i hold my weight i am not quite sure because it also goes on the circumference of you
6408789 they would have to measure the size of the hole in the scanner and the size of my stomach and i havent been brave enough to ask that question
6408790 we simply cant put patients on above a certain weight limit
6408791 if we go close to the limit the risk is the patient might go into the scanner but the table will then jam and perhaps we cant get them out

6408882 the rise of iran continues and that rise was made abundantly clear during the in madrid in early july a large supremely confident iranian delegation attended the triennial gathering that brings together energy officials from all over the world the iranian contingent in madrid was many times larger than the one that attended the 18th world petroleum congress in johannesburg in 2005 then the national iranian oil company had a small booth in the rear of the exhibit hall in sandton consisting of a small sign two tables a handful of chairs and a couple bowls of pistachio nuts this year the iranians had a huge installation inside the sprawling madrid fair exhibition space near the airport the n i o c had a glitzy raised platform of glass plastic and colorful placards that rivaled the scale and flash of those of other national oil companies including chinas sinopec and the kuwait petroleum company indeed the iranians exhibit was immediately next to and almost exactly the same size as saudi aramcos the worlds biggest oil producer

6408885 most of the public is unaware that norovirus and other emerging and dangerous pathogens are not killed by alcohol based gel sanitizers the problem is that most of our hospitals and health care facilities rely on alcohol sanitizers as a substitute for good handwashing practices the use of alcohol is simply not effective against norovirus whether it is in a health care setting or in a public place like a cruise ship

6408896 based on further deterioration in several indices we expect further writedowns primarily related to mortgage assets
6408897 when an event such as the loss of liquidity in the ars markets occurs so fast and companies are forced to respond it provides an opportunity to gauge how well the financial reporting world performs in producing understandable information
6408898 our purpose in studying this event which reflects a microcosm of the broader credit crisis was to highlight differences in disclosures and accounting treatments among registrants related to ars
6408899 comprehensive and consistent disclosures including disclosure of significant judgments regarding valuation matters and a companys liquidity needs are essential to delivering meaningful information to users of financial statements current gaap where the uniqueness of each registrants circumstances affects how companies report information and where judgment is required in determining how much information to disclose can often make apples to apples comparisons among registrants very difficult

6408951 he was like every player who doesnt play affected moving to sunderland is not an emotional decision but the transfer window is nearing its end and he has wished to move on with a deep desire to play
6408952 sunderland are a huge club and their fans are amongst the most passionate in the country
6408953 they live for the game in the north east and there is no doubt that sunderland are a club on the up
6408954 it has been flattering being linked with sunderland and while i have not been angling for a move from fulham you never say never in football

6408965 obiettiavamente mi ha stupito il bagarinaggio fuori dello snodo principale della metropolitana per accedere alla zona olimpica ci sono un bel po di bagarini che vendono i biglietti un po come avviene da noi fuori dagli stadi o dai palazzetti in alcune occasioni ci sono stati anche degli arresti ma la polizia non sembra pi di tanto preoccupata da questo fenomeno e molto spesso lascia fare non me laspettavo proprio

6408972 were focusing our atom supply on the eee pc 901 1000 and 1000h models
6408973 it is simply unacceptable for members of the community to subject our fire crews to abuse at the scene of an incident where they are trying to help
6408974 to enter a fire and rescue service vehicle and carelessly manoeuvre it into other vehicles shows a total lack of respect for the hard work of the emergency services

6409048 missiles and rockets would negate the need for large scale troop deployments in the way they had to carry them out

6409108 a couple of cooler and wetter summers are not really significant in terms of climate change
6409109 these changes will not happen overnight and even when they do we will still have variability in our weather year on year
6409110 the el nino la nina phenomenon that occurs in the eastern pacific
6409111 la nina is an up welling of cold water to the surface of the pacific and we know that there is a strong correlation between this happening and a cool cloudy and unsettled european summer
6409112 la nina has now declined but the effects of it continue to be felt as there is a certain lag in the interaction of ocean and atmosphere and it was certainly in strong evidence during 2007
6409113 higher temperatures in summer could increase the demand for water reduce water availability and cause soils to dry out increasing the risk of building subsidence
6409114 temperatures warmer than average and rainfall near or above average

6409122 gables initial hostility was gone by the time we started which was with a night scene at the greyhound bus depot in downtown los angeles gable very quickly became friendly with the crew i think he found that with capra picture making could be fun

6409145 my focus over the next 48 hours is to prepare my three boxers for their semi final bouts
6409146 the allegations made in the media about the conduct of athletes on the british boxing programme are on the whole unfounded
6409147 i feel extremely disillusioned that i have learnt of the suspension of one of my boxers from the media
6409148 above all though i am so sad that this together with the other allegations made have been raised to distract and unsettle me the coaching team and more importantly my boxers ahead of the most important bouts of their lives

6409150 tough situation were in a pennant race and were in boston and a lot of focus is on him and he feels the responsibility
6409151 i think coming into this game we were all excited about watching him pitch but the way it unraveled makes it kind of obvious we had to do something
6409152 instead of going out there and gritting my teeth and say im going to get this guy out i go out there and think whats going to happen next
6409153 against boston youve got to be able to hit with men on base
6409154 youve got to score when you get opportunities to score because you never know if youre going to have enough runs
6409155 it was tough early but he kept us in the game hung on right there and he gave us a chance to come back
6409156 he kind of figured it out a little bit he went through a rough start but he ended up pretty good

6409211 from available statistics 100 000 infants die from sickle cell disease in nigeria annually making it the number one sickle cell endemic country in africa
6409212 based on world health organization who indices nigeria accounts for 75 percent of infant sickle cell cases in africa and almost 80 percent of infant deaths from the disease in the continent
6409213 this genetic disorder alone accounts for 8 percent of infant mortality in nigeria which calls for urgent attention
6409214 the mutant sickle cell gene confers a survival advantage against malaria which explains the prevalence of the disease in nigeria where malaria is endemic
6409215 this is why we advocate genetic counselling by intending couples before marriage to determine the status of their genes

6409233 our commitment to jesus does not require us to disparage other faiths in testifying to him as lord and savior
6409234 do not forward the christian witness and run counter to our respect for conscience
6409235 but since those remarks have been especially identified with baptists
6409236 it is critical for baptists to come forward in efforts to build trust and goodwill with muslims
6409237 were not representative of baptists as a whole and were contradictory to our respect for religious freedom and conscience
6409238 h e challenged me to work for greater understanding between christians and muslims in the
6409239 cannot ask muslims to advocate for the right of christians to live apart from fear and discrimination as they freely exercise their faith if we are not willing to do the same for them
6409240 we cannot be silent on the matter of the persecution of christians and we need to continue to highlight those situations where christians are experiencing oppression because of their faith in jesus
6409241 to press for their persecuted christians basic rights to be respected while also seeking allies within the muslim community who will advocate for the same
6409242 those of us who share a commitment to peace will find within each of our own traditions those who would take the teachings of our faiths and interpret them for other ends it is a problem common to us all but that ought not to discourage those of us who believe our faiths mandate us to seek peace

6409786 unless your data center is located next to hoover dam this balanced approach of tape and disk allows for maximized overall tco with low energy consumption
6409787 the storage industry has a responsibility to reduce the environmental impact of data centers by adopting and promoting green storage practices that boost efficiency by eliminating waste
6409788 this demands a comprehensive approach that includes driving hardware and software innovation green manufacturing practices and programs that encourage materials recycling and offset carbon emissions
6409789 our storage systems include power control capabilities that allow systems to be remotely powered down when not actively needed
6409790 while not all customers can take advantage of this doing so can save a substantial amount of power for archival storage situations
6409791 this equates to less required floor space less required cooling and less required shipping
6409792 for every watt of energy required to power a product two watts are needed to cool it at fujitsu we have been able to significantly lower the power requirements for our hdds with our sff sas products and this has helped our customers to completely redesign their enterprise level systems to take up less floor space and use less energy for cooling
6409793 eco friendly storage infrastructure is not just about technology its about adopting new views of efficiency
6409794 companies must embrace processes across their entire organizations that are designed to drive efficiency and reduce waste
6409795 manufacturers need to reexamine the energy consumption of their equipment and take steps to be more efficient
6409796 for example reevaluating the criteria used to select switched power supply vendors and adjusting them in favor of products that demonstrate high efficiency not just low cost would be a good place to start for many data center managers

6409899 despite high praise from audience members critically acclaimed performances and the release of the much anticipated cast recording we have made the difficult decision to close the show in london a few weeks earlier than originally planned
6409900 both the knock on effect of the current economic climate as well as disappointing ticket sales throughout the summer months have contributed to our decision to close early
6409901 devastating consequences on women if health professionals follow the apa and withhold potentially lifesaving information about the risks of abortion
6409902 the apa has completely disregarded credible research that shows abortion increasing the risk of clinical depression suicide drug and alcohol abuse and post traumatic stress disorder
6409903 the reports conclusion also flies in the face of what pregnancy centers see every day the anguish of thousands of women and men every year 13 000 in 2006 alone who visit care net centers seeking help from a past abortion
6409904 finally the apas report also contradicts what the supreme court recognized in gonzales v carthart that abortion holds considerable emotional health risks for women
6409905 in the words of carhart women experience grief more anguished and sorrow more profound when they are not informed of the truth about abortion
6409906 the apa may continue to politicize abortion but care net and its network of affiliated pregnancy centers are committed to providing medically referenced and accurate information about abortion risks to empower women to make informed health decisions
6409907 weve heard too many anguished women over the years say i wish someone would have told me abortion would cause me this much grief women deserve the truth
6409908 the chinese leaders keep telling the world the chinese people have religious freedom to even prevent them from receiving bibles certainly contradicts that claim
6409909 the american psychological associations so called study is nothing more than a conclusion supported by opinions screened to match that predetermined outcome
6409910 the apa ignored or downplayed large peer reviewed studies showing a clear link between abortion and subsequent problems such as depression professionalism and intellectual honesty are not concepts i would associate with this report
6409911 its a classic case of the abortion lobbys political and financial interests trumping the truth
6409912 over 600 post abortive women asked to meet with the apa about their experiences with abortion and depression the apa brushed them off just like it dismissed any scientific study that didnt agree with its agenda

6409926 and that essentially adding an additional doctor who then has to be called in an emergency situation to come in and make these assessments is really designed simply to burden the original decision of the woman and the physician to induce labor and perform an abortion

6409938 its certainly true that as a society we need to work on improving our food quality increasing opportunities for activity developing more public health resources and creating more responsibility in our media messages
6409939 however as parents we cant afford to wait for government or society to solve the problem we have to step in and seize the right to control our home environments and change our habits and priorities
6409940 i called some people on huntsman road they never heard the name pierce
6409941 that is not the case we are not in any way connected with the magazine company so in turn we wanted to let the public know that they should be aware of potential scams
6409942 it wasnt frightening at all i mean ive had issues in my life that were pretty hair raising this was just kind of a thing to wonder about
6409943 from transporting them from place to place they flex and a lot of times this is where we get the stress cracks

6409958 we aim to address the large number of weaners calves weaned from the cows that leave the country on the hoof to south african abattoirs where they are kept at feedlots and which are lost to local value adding in the namibian food production chain
6409959 it is better to rear cattle until the right size to be slaughter ready than selling off weaner calves that are only a few months old
6409960 it would be much better to obtain a loan to buy cattle and rear them on your land knowing at the end of that period you can sell them at a guaranteed minimum price at our abattoirs than leasing the land to somebody else who makes money with it under ekwatho we target 30 000 animals
6409961 the response was enormous as the demand for such specified financial support is high and loans up to nearly n 25 million for 8 000 head of cattle were approved to date
6409962 it is important for all three partners meatco the banks and the farmers that this unique financing vehicle is working in a viable manner and the pilot phase has proved this

6409967 i appeal to government to come with the right policies and support to help those 70 per cent of the population living in rural areas but the farmers unions should also provide longer training than just for a few days
6409968 leave their air conditioned offices and go where the business is

6409992 a human being is a part of the whole that we call the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical illusion of his consciousness this illusion is a prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for only the few people nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living beings and all of nature
