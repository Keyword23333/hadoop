420046 it was pretty much the same with the last record
420047 weve been working on acoustic guitars and then trying to bring it all together as a full band were not sure whats going to happen yet but weve been having a lot of fun we havent stopped writing songs since we stopped recording pretty odd because we have a lot to write about
420048 its sounding pretty awesome which is probably what were going to call the next record
420049 weve got quite a few new ideas and songs weve been working on and were hoping to record some of that stuff by the end of the year
420050 i can tell you its on our latest record its in the middle somewhere

420054 we are always interested in any kind of workshop that is empowering and will encourage girls to feel like they can do anything
420055 they can create their own environment and be creative in the risks that they take
420056 if you can find other girls to play with its not just a bonding experience its not just about the music its sort of this big empowerment thing
420057 its a confidence builder youre playing and youre jelling together on a stage in front of people who are pumping you up and its just a really big empowerment and confidence booster
420058 we actually put a bunch of names in a little baggy and drew out four or five random words and put them together and we wrote down about 40 different possible names

420069 i would love to step out of disney and maybe do a couple of roles maybe challenging roles and fun roles new things like that
420070 to decide to hold a reelection first of all we have to rely on law
420071 if the municipal and provincial committees find severe irregularities in any voting office or commune they can propose that the nec conduct a re election there if the nec discovers a serious case of irregularities the nec can decide to conduct a re election within a period of eight days after the decision is made
420072 our nec officials reported that there have not yet been any serious cases of irregularities
420073 i understand that this can be a bad cambodian habit after election ever since 1993 elections have had protests and sometimes the protests were inappropriate and in breach of procedures but this is the right of political parties in any democratic country
420074 just for personal reasons and you know because its miley and theyre gonna do good were gonna do good too the audience is gonna vote so well see
420075 were not gonna see it until its live so i have no idea
420076 yeah i was surprised it got so big that we had to do it somewhere like this
420077 the tension is building up and people are getting nervous were gonna smoke the audience
420078 what do you expect i mean were real people i have nothing bad to say about anybody
420079 although we are not satisfied with the outcome we will not make a complaint against the election results which could cause national political instability

420084 but its still dip set 4 life its just going to be a new chapter
420085 i have no hard feeling for cam after all he did give me a chance but i will say this i was loyal to him and he took advantage
420086 after the eighth album im done i already feel it i love acting i love my music like i said but i feel it after this one probably one more in me and thats eight like im one album behind nas and thats crazy
420087 its funny because everybody always wants to talk about you know bow wow doesnt curse hes clean which is true
420088 i think a lot of people that are jumping on bow wow now are new people and if you listen to my first album i was being bad on my first album
420089 i still have the younger generation the younger kids look up to me then again i have that other fanbase who was with me from the jump who are now adults too and its almost like i gotta cater to both but if i miss one of em theyll go find that other person to fill that slot
420090 i know the girls theyre going to go crazy when they see it
420091 the ladies are gonna go crazy when they see bow wows first sex scene its crazy cause for me it was normal it was normal but i know when i look back at it when i see it im gonna be like damn look at this this is crazy i stun myself sometimes i cant even front
420092 it was with a porn star i dont know her name
420093 she probably watching this like what i did a scene with him and he doesnt remember my name nah i dont remember her name but she was bad though she was baaaaad i was cool i was comfortable with it i was definitely comfortable with it it is what it is normal stuff that happens

420098 just one blistering sunburn in childhood can double the risk of developing melanoma later in life
420099 that risk can be vastly reduced by following some simple sun safety guidelines
420100 i knew it was going to turn heads and that it was going to make a statement and we really appreciate that
420101 weve always been a band thats had things about us and things that are going on that creates big bold waves and whats so weird about the perception of the crusade is we wanted to show people that were not just a band thats going to stick to the same formula every time on that record we accomplished our main goal and that was to make it the exact opposite of 2005s ascendancy we didnt want to do anything that happened on that record on the next one but we still wanted to keep it us because we feel were a band that can broaden its sound and not just stick with one thing it was still metal and it was still trivium just different and diversified
420102 with this new record it basically summarizes everything we feel weve done right as a band that we feel are key ingredients of trivium all rolled into one with a new direction on top of it
420103 so it does have a little bit of everything weve done and some more it has as much singing on it as
420104 with the crusade we were done with screaming done with bands that did it done with doing it ourselves
420105 we just didnt want to do it anymore but when we started jamming for shogun and we heard how brutal and heavy some of the stuff was its the heaviest sh weve ever done before we tried singing over it and it wasnt right what was it missing the screaming and thats exactly what it needed
420106 we decided to take an old school approach to the record using new school technology purely for convenience because tape takes so f ing long to record with
420107 nick made us play this record the way metal is done these days you track it a couple of times make sure its perfect and then you go in and fix a couple of the pieces retrigger the guitars and drums thats just the way it is but we wanted to go back to the old school way record everything right with no triggers on our drums we had to make sure the performance was there and the energy was there and hearing the end result the stuff nick drew out of us is just unreal in terms of heaviness and brutality its the best thing weve done before wed never really considered ourselves a contender for even the word heavy or brutal but this time things are different
420108 just a big combination of everything wed loved as kids
420109 everyone weve played it for theyre all really excited about it
420110 i think weve found our sound weve just discovered it and with the next one i think well define it it takes a band a little while to find their sound some bands get it on the first record and some bands it takes several i think were one of those bands thats going to develop and fully come into our sound someday we dont know what record that will be but this record is even closer to what its going to be
420111 so how does that thing throw with so much force
420112 admantium affray ive heard of these things but the stories are old and always deal with the heralds

420196 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
420197 if this holiday is that important to them make them take it off instead of christmas day and allow all workers to be off labor day most american families have some type of function on labor day
420198 it says union leadership made this request makes you wonder who runs the union i guess they are already working on a plan to replace memorial day that means nothing to the muslims so why should we have the right to celebrate it labor day commemorates the plight of workers and the struggle of labor unions to improve working conditions for american workers the muslims will not stop until all of our rights and laws are changed to accommodate their beliefs this will be a new america but it will be their america
420199 diversity is one of the strengths of our union we may come from different countries and speak different languages but what unites us is the belief that by standing together we can better advance our interests
420200 the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
420201 two prayer rooms have been created to allow muslim workers to pray twice a day and return to work without leaving the plant
420202 this is america founded by the blood of our forefathers and should not be challenged by somalians hispanics or any other immigrants if they come to america they need to learn our language and our ways they can practice their culture in private if they so please but not shove it down our throats would they let us go there and change there country i have banned tysons products from my home for years because of the illegals they were hiring i am sorry for the producers that are supplying them but tysons has once again crossed the line with the american people labor day was here long before tysons what holiday will be next to be taken away and replaced to accommodate an immigrant this stinks worse than the plant
420203 is it possible for us to witness a world without america and zionism
420204 we cant discriminate against religion the other is we cant discriminate in favor of religion
420205 it would essentially violate the rights of male lifeguards if we only hired female lifeguards for certain duty

420306 it was a pretty good performance from the all blacks
420307 they built pressure and they profited from that and didnt allow us to build pressure and they grew in confidence
420308 the line out performance was not one well reflect on with a lot of pride and that reflected the way the game went
420309 well be going into the libraries at night and setting up a sound system and the crowd will be literally among the books
420310 were doing an eight day tour because were ambassadors of the national year of reading and stuff
420311 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1 percent
420312 akba has anti inflammatory properties and we have shown that b serrata enriched with akba can be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee the high incidence of adverse effects associated with currently available medications has created great interest in the search for an effective and safe alternative treatment

420315 we expressed concern about the trucks from day one wiggs said
420316 it rail traffic really doesnt have anything to do with our review said pat steed the planning councils executive director explaining the operation of railroads is governed by federal regulations
420317 if theres no teeth behind it how will it work she asked
420318 if were careful and deliberate we can have something that well be proud of he said
420319 weve gone beyond the basic questions and believe we can do it here gernert said
420320 the planning council staff has been thorough in developing its report and recommended conditions
420321 in our model the mice showed tibial bowing similar to that observed in nf1 patients however since mouse legs are not subjected to the same excessive mechanical forces as humans we also applied a bone injury model
420322 this enables analysis of the complex process of bone repair while at the same time causing the least possible distress to the animals
420323 they have also accepted to donate the rest of his organs to save greek people
420324 we must do more to tackle the rise in prison suicides and promote sensitive media reporting of suicides
420325 the whole hamlet is in uproar about it it is a council road and we have always had deliveries by the mail van i know it is steep and i know it is narrow but there are lots of little roads like that you just have to drive carefully i drive up and down the road in a normal car and have had no problems there have been no accidents on that hill i know because i have lived here most of my life
420326 these findings are significant because the national health and nutrition examination survey shows 58 percent of all current drinkers in the united states reported usual alcohol consumption that exceeded the dietary guidelines and 52 percent of all current drinkers reported at least one episode of binge drinking in the past year
420327 most people who consume alcohol in the united states drink in ways that may increase their risk of the metabolic syndrome and related conditions
420328 we think there is something special about these mice they have the ability to regenerate cartilage
420329 knee pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints that bring people to their doctor
420330 human cartilage injuries heal poorly and can lead to cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis this is an enormous clinical problem it is estimated that one quarter of the adult population will have some kind of arthritis by 2020
420331 doctors have told me i could drop dead at any minute i cant walk more than a few steps without getting out of breath and a few months ago i developed type 2 diabetes when i look in the mirror i feel sad and go to my bedroom and cry i know its partly my fault but its so hard to stop eating its like a drug some people choose heroin but ive chosen food and its killing me
420332 dairy and other foods that are rich in calcium are thought to be important for the growth and strengthening of bones in children and adolescents
420333 in the us dairy products tend to be the preferred source of calcium since diets that exclude dairy are often deficient in this important nutrient
420334 the new findings show that for those children who have inadequate calcium intake increasing dietary calcium has a significant impact on bone development
420335 since most children dont get enough calcium meeting calcium recommendations may help to prevent future osteoporosis
420336 these findings are so clear and detailed at the level of molecular behaviour that they will be most valuable to developing more effective therapies for mood disorders and neurologic and psychiatric diseases and to direct effective treatments for drug addiction to cocaine and amphetamines
420337 this research may also open the door to the development of new therapies for dopamine neurotransmitter disorders such as parkinsons disease schizophrenia and anxiety and depression
420338 for the first time we may have a highly useful model of postpartum depression
420339 the new research also points to a specific potential new target in the brain for medications to treat this disorder that affects 15 percent of women after they give birth
420340 after giving birth female mice deficient in the suspect protein showed depression like behaviors and neglected their newborn pups
420341 giving a drug that restored the proteins function improved maternal behavior and reduced pup mortality
420342 this gene by itself does not appear to increase the risk for overall and for specific cardiovascular disease but rather this research suggests a possible connection between the gene variant and migraine with aura
420343 our findings suggest that anti pc can be used as a complement to the traditional risk factors to improve diagnosis and treatment in addition we are currently developing anti pc as a vaccine for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease
420344 we are very excited because it appears the oral vaccine is even more effective than traditional injectable vaccine this could really make a difference
420345 we showed we could block behaviour in mice that resembles this increased euphoria even after the animals had been given a lot of alcohol
420346 thats what you want in a treatment because we dont get to people until after they become addicted to alcohol

420349 flow happens not when youre relaxed but when youre actively involved in something thats quite difficult in a task that stretches you and challenges your ability
420350 people get that kind of pleasure out of all kinds of things a challenging job surfing puzzle solving and its actually the key to what makes a really good game
420351 its something educators really want to capture in the creation of learning tools because it is about challenge and learning and its something that games do very well
420352 just playing a game doesnt mean that youre not learning because in many cases you are games are being found more and more in the classroom with people using existing games as ways to explore ideas
420353 the transition from adolescence to adulthood has been shown to be a time for taking on many negative health behaviors including increases in smoking and alcohol use and decreases in physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption
420354 in this study we were investigating whether tv viewership and recognition of snack advertisements were associated with snack food consumption and the odds of being overweight or obese
420355 the link between how much a person snacks while watching tv was directly related to viewing food advertisements specifically when choosing to eat an energy dense snack
420356 the exposure to the advertising seems to stimulate a desire to eat that particular food product also sitting watching tv provides a prime opportunity to snack
420357 i want to personally make sure that every baby born here will not be hiv positive
420358 this centre is one of several hundred that have received help from the foundation but will soon be one of thousands
420359 no patients that we have been able to identify have died as a result of a misdiagnosis
420360 however a number of patients are undergoing treatment and we cannot definitively say they will not be affected later on it would be misleading the public to say so
420361 some people with the mutation have hearing loss in their 40s of the kind we normally see in people a decade or more older often identifying a gene in individuals who have early onset of a disorder will help explain why the disorder occurs in the general population
420362 our new study shows that subjects with a mother with alzheimers show similarities with alzheimers patients they have metabolic reductions in the brain regions that are typically affected by ad which worsen over time
420363 if any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest i do think it is memory there seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers the failures the inequalities of memory than in any other of our intelligences
420364 what is involved in these procedures is often unclear since recognised clinical nomenclature is not being used
420365 the real risks of potential complications such as scarring permanent disfigurement infection dyspareunia and altered sexual sensations should be discussed in detail with women seeking such treatments
420366 the college is particularly concerned that such surgery may exploit vulnerable women
420367 we feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help
420368 they are also not very anatomically based and have the potential to cause serious harm
420369 as we age the majority of these skin problems are a direct result of long term sun exposure also the loss and movement of the underlying fat layer of the skin over time causes us to lose volume in our skin creating that sunken in look fortunately we now have a number of minimally invasive procedures that can be used either alone or in combination to combat the telltale signs of aging
420370 we have about 40 000 genes in every cell and the main reason a brain cell is a brain cell is because only a small fraction of the genes are turned on the remaining genes that are not expressed are shut down by an epigenetic process called dna methylation
420371 the exciting part of this study is that we have discovered a completely new process that regulates the adverse responses to bad memories
420372 these findings can help the development of new drugs to treat conditions in which people are haunted by persistent fears such as posttraumatic stress disorder or other panic disorders
420373 baseline dopamine levels were 50 percent lower and stimulated dopamine release was significantly attenuated in the brain reward systems of obesity prone rats compared with obesity resistant rats defects in brain dopamine synthesis and release were evident in rats immediately after birth
420374 previous research has demonstrated that food intake leads to an increase in the release of dopamine in the circuits that mediate the pleasurable aspects of eating
420375 given that bacterial vaginosis and hiv infection are both transmitted sexually it is difficult to determine whether associations found are causal or if there is some other reason why women with bv are more likely that others to become infected with hiv
420376 if additional follow up studies show that there was a relationship between bv and the risk of incident hiv infection though then increasing the treatment of bv could be considered for the future prevention of hiv infection
420377 many of those who are coming have told their work or families that they are going on vacation
420378 theyre afraid of saying theyre taking part in an aids conference
420379 i contracted aids after having unprotected sex the guy didnt tell me he had hiv i fell in love him so i didnt use a condom
420380 he was the first patient with aids in my town he was a soldier who had served in africa
420381 the man required round the clock assistance a condition he wanted to change as quickly as possible
420382 sonography report shows that the foetus has a congental complete heart block
420383 there are very fair chances that the child will be born incapacitated and handicapped to survive
420384 looking into the urgency of the matter the report should be in by monday morning
420385 malaria is still the leading cause of morbidity and mortality
420386 in 2007 we recorded about four million malaria cases in our health facilities and about 7 000 deaths due to malaria
420387 expects to see a marked reduction in mortality and morbidity from malaria
420388 this is unacceptable malaria is preventable and we can save lives by ensuring that pregnant mothers and under five children sleep under treated mosquito nets these nets cost only 700 zambia kwacha us 20 cents on the market
420389 i think this is interesting research as it shows a reasonably consistent effect the reduction in blood pressure is not trivial it is the same as gained from taking pills
420390 ive modelled since i was 14 and ive managed to do the odd day here and there over the last couple of years so i had the contacts and wanted to do something that would make an impact and raise awareness of fibromyalgia
420391 even though i am used to having my picture taken it was daunting at the end of the day i am disabled now its not a visual disability because if you looked at me apart from my cane you wouldnt notice anything so it was very scary doing it but it was also fun
420392 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
420393 our data indicate an abrupt increase in storminess during the autumn to spring seasons occurring from one year to the next at 12 679 years before the present broadly coincident with other changes in this region
420394 we suggest that this shift in wind strength represents an abrupt change in the north atlantic westerlies towards a stronger and more zonal jet
420395 may have put herself in potential jeopardy of having contravened a provision of the security of information act
420396 that their disclosure would not have caused significant injury to the national interest
420397 people are over reacting to bernier leaving some documents and his girlfriends house ministers do this all the time but it isnt reported so i dont think a full public inquirery is warranted in this situation
420398 ive always been in favor of making sure that the application fees are high enough that we do recoup 100 percent of the cost of processing the applications
420399 we dont provide this service on behalf of the taxpayers we do it on behalf of the applicants and we want to make sure they are the ones who are paying for it
420400 if they can substantiate that this is what it is costing then its justifiable
420401 creates a tax base in calvert county that keeps residential tax rates as low as they are
420402 we are asking for a one year stay so we can look at what has happened with alternative energy and other things
420403 i dont think people realize the significance of what we are doing when we build this stuff
420404 when i was a little girl in vacation bible school we made a pin cushion out of soda pop cans it was shaped into a rocking chair i would like to get instuctions on how to make this
420405 jack nicklaus isnt here so i guess thats a substitute
420406 because it would be pretty scary if it got a little panicky and some spectator or some of the golfers were too close that wouldnt have been an issue if a caddie had gotten too close
420407 the usga put some pin placements on us today that almost defy the imagination
420408 its just treacherous treacherous greens out there with some unbelievable pin placements
420409 im not going to comment about the golf course the usga should know better
420410 we try to give the players what we think is a hard golf course but fair and today theres no question we had a couple of hard hole locations but they were well within our tolerances
420411 we like where the course is now we dont want it to get any harder
420412 its your blog dammit and its all about you so go ahead make another negative post why dont you
420413 he would play this baseball video game and say you know dad your stuffs not very good
420414 he asked why are the yankees always so good every video game we get theyve got the best team i explained to him that they spend a lot of money on players if a player is really good they try to trade for him usually they have kind of an all star team
420415 about two months later i was signing autographs he said dead serious why would anyone want your autograph he said youre not any good youre just average
420416 i said ive been pitching in the big leagues about 10 years ive done this and that he said dad if you were any good the yankees would have traded for you
420417 jeg frygter det ikke men det vil tiden vise det er en frustrerende tid men jeg m overholde l gernes r d jeg t nker ikke over hvorn r jeg er tilbage men at komme tilbage p den rigtige m de og i det tempo det kr ver

420419 and a comparatively hairless manny ramirez was still unhappy albeit in cleveland
420420 i figured hed get plunked for his little bat flip in his last at bat when he homered off of todd jones
420421 the u m players always have said how much they enjoy heroes for kids and the strength and conditioning coach mike barwis said he wants to work with us on this next year
420422 but this workout is mandatory and all players must attend its coach rods call on that this is his first year at u m and hes doing everything he can to make sure his team is successful
420423 besides there are more important things going on like the upcoming presidential election get out and vote it would be great to see history made this time around like seeing americas first african american president go obama
420424 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues
420425 im not so far into it i dont feel i need to be hands on into it
420426 im giving the maximum donation to obama then it might have been hypocritical this wasnt an announcement it was a reporter doing his job and kpd i think you are simply looking for an argument if you believe that article was in any way slanted towards either of the candidates
420427 barack obama is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life
420428 boy he can put up a triple double at will im going to vote the way he votes
420429 as a washington wizards fan theres no way ill ever vote for anyone that lbj would consider
420430 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues but if sports can create awareness and shed light on this issue then thats a good thing
420431 i didnt sign the letter right then and there so now its blown up
420432 no one heard my side of the story but automatically its lebron didnt sign the letter he doesnt care but for me to try to create awareness of the situation thats going on in darfur and other places for me in the position i am i should speak on it and i am gonna speak on it
420433 at the end of the day were talking about human rights
420434 and people should understand that human rights and peoples lives are in jeopardy were not talking about contracts here were not talking about money were talking about peoples lives being lost and that means a lot more to me than some money or a contract
420435 ricky davis is now an la clipper finishing at last his 8 or 9 year journey to his true destiny
420436 id be lying if i said i thought it would happen like it has here in the past year
420437 i was on the verge of not wanting to play here any more dealing with the fans and not winning i was like all right ill get through with my contract and ill see what happens but now were on the verge of something special we had a good year last year and this is definitely a football town and its turning back around this is a fun place to play when youre winning
420438 but now were on the verge of something special we had a good year last year and this is definitely a football town and its turning back around this is a fun place to play when youre winning

420441 casual security bungling cops and paradise suddenly turning into hell the horrific murder of the antigua honeymoon bride has echoes of the madeleine mccann case
420442 now that argu do status has been l fted can we at last have an answer to the quest on
420443 why did you react in that extraordinary way when you were first asked the question
420444 miliband has crossed the rubicon and is now in kill or be killed territory
420445 we always have known that price influences perceptions of quality
420446 what we were curious about now that we know this is whether this perception benefit is just psychological or whether price can influence the true pleasure
420447 contrary to the basic assumptions of economics several studies have provided behavioral evidence that marketing actions can successfully affect experienced pleasantness by manipulating nonintrinsic attributes of goods

420450 what were the odds that florida was going to be within a thousandth of one percent
420451 its going to be close enough that a tie is definitely possible if its close its possible it becomes closer to 2 percent
420452 new mexico tends to mirror the national polls so when you see a national poll showing obama up 4 to 6 points thats a pretty good indicator
420453 the question is can obama resonate among hispanic democrats and rural democrats can he be seen as a regular guy
420454 if you go to a supermarket here theres a decent chance an obama worker is going to ask you to register to vote i think obama has a lead but i wouldnt bet a lot of money on it
420455 its something to almost prepare for and think through because it would really be a disaster
420456 i have become a symbol of restoring america to its best traditions
420457 pemerintah memang tidak serius untuk merealisasikan penuntasan wajib belajar yang berkualitas sampai sekarang pemerintah masih saja disibukkan dengan mengalkulasi apa yang ditanggung pemerintah dan apa yang mesti ditanggung daerah

420470 ketidakpedulian terhadap makan pagi telah membuat pola diet masyarakat berubah ini memengaruhi kesehatan dan produktivitas mereka jika kebiasaan itu meluas akan memengaruhi bangsa ini
420471 perubahan ini menjadi potret dari gaya hidup masyarakat saat ini
420472 muncul ketergantungan terhadap makanan yang berasal dari luar kuliner tradisional jepang semakin tergusur bahkan kami khawatir kekayaan kuliner itu akan hilang
420473 dibandingkan dengan 20 atau 10 tahun lalu kini jumlah penduduk yang mengalami obesitas semakin tinggi begitu pula yang mengalami kekurangan berat badan
420474 health japan 21 untuk mencapai target tertentu pada tahun 2010
420475 gerakan itu bukan hanya untuk mencapai kondisi kesehatan masyarakat yang lebih baik tetapi sebuah gerakan kependudukan untuk membangun manusia jepang abad ke 21
420476 health japan 21 diharapkan antara lain pada tahun 2010 perempuan kurus usia 20 tahun di jepang kurang dari 15 persen adapun pria usia 20 60 tahun yang mengalami obesitas kurang dari 15 persen dan perempuan 40 60 tahun yang mengalami obesitas kurang dari 20 persen
420477 tampaknya sederhana hanya soal membentuk berat badan yang seimbang namun sebenarnya itu sebuah program besar yaitu membangun gaya hidup sehat dan seimbang pada masyarakat jepang
420478 health japan 21 tahun 2010 pada tahun 2005 pemerintah membentuk badan promosi syokuiku atau pendidikan tentang makanan yang bertugas selama lima tahun yaitu tahun 2006 2010 ada sembilan target yang harus dicapai dalam program syokuiku
420479 dana itu tidak seberapa dibandingkan dengan hasil yang akan dicapai jika gaya hidup masyarakat semakin baik kesehatan masyarakat pun akan semakin baik artinya subsidi untuk kesehatan bisa semakin kecil kalau kualitas hidup semakin baik produktivitas penduduk akan semakin tinggi dan itu berdampak pada perekonomian negeri ini

420483 be careful what you wish for because it may come true
420484 and what it would be like if it could be altered by human wishes what goes on in the mind and heart of someone who makes such wishes as in great work of time for two different examples and the open ended nature of the course of time that produces unintended consequences not always good or bad
420485 hey guys mom is sorry she kind of raised you to celebrate a sick hybrid of christianized paganism jesus was born in mid september and the bible never mentions that we are to celebrate or honor his birth in any type of celebration we reject everything catholic and they started this whole things with a mish mash combo of mitharism mixed with catholicism and neither have anything to do with what the holy bible teaches believers to do i am sorry about the lies and the deceptions that i passed down to you and this year i am putting my actions where my heart is i hope you will forgive me for leading you astray
420486 but i think i am adaptable because i have a very indian face
420487 i agree that bollywood is a male centric industry but i expect the media to be intelligent if heroes who are over 40 are paired opposite much younger heroines it is not talked about
420488 but if i am romantically paired against heroes two to three years younger than me a big issue is made out of it it is really unfortunate
420489 ranbir has even worked as an assistant director compared to them i have learnt everything while on the job

420492 fitness is about 50 percent diet and 50 percent exercise sugar constitutes for the extra calories in our diet which has no nutritive value except for just empty calories hence when it comes to endorsing sugar free gold a sugar substitute it comes very naturally to me as i myself use the product
420493 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1 percent
420494 old photostat copies from the 20s and 30s are shiny like that so this is why youd think this is not a real document

420497 la selecci n se va a la puta que lo pari
420498 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
420499 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
420500 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
420501 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
420502 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
420503 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
420504 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
420505 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
420506 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president
420507 it would be inherently cruel to move her to mexico
420508 weve grown up with jenny shes our family she deserves better than getting sent to a drive through tourist attraction in mexico
420509 jennys situation is of great concern to many people i represent
420510 this is not an indictment of the zoo in mexico but jenny deserves to be somewhere she will be happy
420511 we know she is a nervous elephant and with protected contact she can approach people if she wants to and we can monitor her stress levels easily without anyone getting hurt or killed
420512 these animals need our help to protect their natural habitat as well as facilitate conservation programs throughout the country that are helping new generations of wildlife stewards and conservationists
420513 whenever you deal with children or animals you have to consider a lot of options
420514 were still trying to go through our plans and we usually have time to consider our options but with all the furor that weve had to go through weve had to be a little more outspoken about our choices

420599 operation balls pursuit was intended to deny enemy safe haven limit enemy freedom of maneuver and interdict the flow of foreign fighters in the area
420600 there was not a house that didnt get a visit
420601 sheik amar is a great man and a great leader and im confident hell do good things here
420602 the community is still in mourning because they lost a great leader
420603 but theyre still pushing through and moving forward thats why this event is so significant because it shows that the iraqi people are determined to push through no matter what al qaida in iraq throws at them regardless of what they do aqi is loosing their foothold in the area
420604 we designed the iraqi police master trainer program to try to get the biggest impact from a small element of u s soldiers
420605 the program has changed a great deal from its initial stage through input from everyone in the platoon we hand picked iraqi police who displayed leadership potential at their stations and brought them in for training
420606 the threat of improvised explosive devices has gone down so much since i last deployed to iraq it used to be a pretty regular thing to get hit
420607 we go out each night and sweep different areas but are not turning up very much at all anymore
420608 i would characterize the enemy in our area as being neutralized we still see occasional al qaida in iraq violence in the area and were very watchful to ensure we dont allow a resurgence of aqi activity
420609 most people believe that aqi has fled al anbar at least for the time being and its our responsibility to make sure that they cant reestablish themselves back in our area
420610 violence is down to its lowest level since the spring of 2004
420611 there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
420612 because of these operations extremists who once terrorized the citizens of these communities have been driven from their strongholds
420613 was able to walk the streets of sadr city last wednesday
420614 probably the most exciting thing for me is i compare today to our partnership with the ia in 2006 and its night and day
420615 we designed the iraqi police master trainer program to try to get the biggest impact from a small element of u s soldiers
420616 the program has changed a great deal from its initial stage through input from everyone in the platoon we hand picked iraqi police who displayed leadership potential at their stations and brought them in for training
420617 these are those things that complete the capabilities of the iraqi security forces and enable them to accomplish their mission
420618 lifting the fear barrier between the iraqi security forces and the people
420619 probably the most exciting thing for me is i compare today to our partnership with the ia in 2006 and its night and day
420620 the future is the ia taking up training all on its own its already begun
420621 we make sure the iraqis get the necessary training and advice so that they may operate their own military properly
420622 my soldiers did a great job responding to the tip given to them by the local resident
420623 this shows that the people of rusafa can trust us to secure and protect their city
420624 when completed the new judicial facility will serve more than two million residents
420625 its a magnificent structure built by local iraqis who tell me theyre very proud to be part of this effort
420626 as the rule of law reduces the power of selfish men the economical and agricultural capacities of iraq will blossom
420627 i honestly believe that all this and so much more is possible through creating enforcing and obeying fair and just law
420628 our plan is to conduct a transfer of authority of southern baghdad not with another coalition forces element but with the 17th iraqi army division
420629 the mere fact that the brigade operating in this area has been directed and has had the ability to transform itself into a division speaks volumes of the capability of the iraqi army leaders and the local support of its own security forces
420630 major general ali is no doubt a leader with a nationalistic view on how to secure his area of operations he is willing to take on all that the coalition forces have and are doing to include the counter insurgency fight
420631 this is the spirit of democracy that is encouraging progress throughout muthanna and iraq
420632 zawahri has been killed by them several times but once again this claim is wrong this is baseless
420633 they will serve as a companion to help during the veterans transition
420634 weve been told that a lot of veterans are proud of what they have done but that theres an awkwardness about adjusting
420635 anc leaders have now vowed that zuma will walk free no matter what evidence there is against him
420636 they are effectively saying that if you are powerful enough you are above the law
420637 more people have been killed in south africa in the last five years than in the war in iraq
420638 the statistics no longer mean much they cannot express the pain that is felt by every south african who has lost a loved one to violent crime
420639 behind every statistic are human beings whose lives have been taken away or have been irredeemably changed forever this is what our government either does not understand or does not want to talk about
420640 it is often said that when a south african is a victim of crime they are a victim twice they are victimised first by violent criminals and then re victimised by the criminal justice system this has to change
420641 they crime victims should be entitled to compensation for medical and other costs they are forced to incur
420642 there needs to be a legally enforceable victims of crime charter that sets out exactly what the rights of victims are and how they will be enforced
420643 on redoutait le pire ce sera les lettons ou les norv giens le tirage est quelque part une bonne chose pour nous mais il faudra tout de m me jouer les matches
420644 on ne peut pas avoir le beurre et largent du beurre quand on veut jouer la ligue des champions on ne doit pas sarr ter de tels inconv nients
420645 theres no doubt that when it comes to our treatment of native americans as well as other persons of color in this country weve got some very sad and difficult things to account for
420646 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
420647 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
420648 the biggest problem that we have in terms of race relations i think is dealing with the legacy of past discrimination which has resulted in extreme disparities in terms of poverty in terms of wealth and in terms of income our inner cities are a legacy of what happened in the past and the question is less assigning blame or rooting out active racism because thats not the reason that those inner cities are in such bad shape but rather figuring out are we willing to make the investments to deal with that past history so we can move forward to a brighter future and that involves investing in early childhood education fixing the schools in those communities being willing to work in terms of job retraining and those are serious investments
420649 is serious investments code for reparations and how expensive and devastating would obamas income redistribution policy be
420650 fundamental injustice cruelty brutality and inhumanity of slavery and jim crow
420651 does barack obama believe its time for america to apologize to al qaida
420652 the push has begun among obamas fellow liberals for reparations to osama bin ladens al qaida warriors
420653 in wonderfully liberal style that is beyond parody rutten uses a book review to endorse the idea of paying money to osamas fighters who in the eyes of liberals have been denied their right of habeas corpus at guantanamo
420654 the liberals on the court with the mind boggling addition of reagan appointee anthony kennedy held that contrary to bush administration and congressional policy not to mention all of american history the prisoners of war or detainees picked up off the battlefields in this case afghanistan and iraq are in fact entitled to the same constitutional rights as american citizens
420655 lobbying not simply for habeas corpus rights for al qaida but reparations as well
420656 in other words if you have been captured on the field of battle fighting the u s military on behalf of the global jihad and as a result are now on an extended stay at gitmo liberals feel the appropriate policy of the united states government is to 1 apologize for capturing you and 2 pay you some cold american cash to ease your pain and humiliation
420657 we still gave them a day in court and that taught the entire world about who we are but also the basic principles of rule of law
420658 if americas only problem was with a sum total of about 1 800 german soldiers why all that disturbing fuss known as world war ii
420659 stashed in 511 internment camps sprinkled all around the good old usa from north carolina to iowa to california
420660 not a single one of these men were given their habeas corpus rights they were not tried not one they were held as prisoners forced to do whatever labor their american captors thought suitable until america had won the war
420661 will obama have the courage to follow the arguments to their logical conclusions if the idea is to have american taxpayers fork over damages to osamas men why not hitlers where are the trial lawyers who have been flocking to guantanamo the size of the damage pot in a suit against the u s government for the treatment of nazis would one suspects be considerable

420669 es un poco distinta a lo esperado pero es reconstruible

420671 y en esa tarea hemos y seguimos trabajando en el nimo de seguir privilegiando los acuerdos y sacar adelante la agenda
420672 respecto a la posibilidad de incorporar otras sugerencias pues cuando stas lleguen si finalmente se concretan las iniciativas que tengan alguna cuesti n de esta naturaleza o si en la discusi n de los dict menes alguien sugiere incorporar cosas que vayan m s all en ello el gobierno siempre est dispuesto a que la iniciativa sea enriquecida y que finalmente sea una iniciativa que pueda ser aprobada por una mayor a en el congreso

420674 its tough i love victoria and i love the empress but the opportunity to run the hotel in the run up toward the olympics and be there for one of the worlds most spectacular events was too hard to turn down
420675 its different now that i have a family before when i was single or with just my wife it was easy to move but now every time i have to consider the children and what it will mean for them
420676 at this point they are still young and this will be exciting for them

420682 rapid economic growth is the essential first step to enable the generation of resources and surpluses that can be used for social and economic development having said this it is equally essential for economic growth to be inclusive it is incumbent on all of us to create the conditions for such growth and all round development

420711 anyone can be a father but not everyone can be a dad
420712 courage is resistance to fear mastery of fear not absence of fear
420713 this is the most important game of the season right now
420714 were two games out and weve got a back to back series against them it cant get any better than this if we want to be like those guys right now heres an opportunity for us to take advantage of the situation
420715 in order for us to win everybody has to do their part
420716 we had a great week of practice were just focused in on what we have to do here
420717 hes practised well all week and hes practised with a kind of aggressiveness that he didnt have during the time that he was injured i expect him to play well
420718 we do have skill and we count on players to make plays but its really all part of our team concept
420719 the team concept does help us when we are battling against the injuries because the players who step in expect to do well plus the people who are on the team and have those players step in expect those people to perform well
420720 when you come and play guys you know obviously you want to have bragging rights
420721 im going to come out here and im going to play my best ball
420722 i came to saskatchewan and i got my ring and now im trying to make a name for myself as one of the best players in the league
420723 it worked out better for me so i should almost send them a thank you card
420724 it was a win win for both teams because lazeo definitely came in and has been a vocal leader for us and a leader for us on the field
420725 he brings a lot of nastiness to our offensive line which we kind of need
420726 we feel like we can go out and make some plays
420727 weve got to score earlier and often if we score early and often well be all right

420734 that was the only year of my life i knew what was going on in school
420735 in that first game against saskatoon theyre defending champs so it wasnt a surprise we got second place in that one
420736 that second game we played well and the game at night was a good game for most of the game we played well and its just they got hot at the right time and got a couple of key hits at the right time
420737 if we play good thatll get us a chance to go into the playoff round
420738 there are so many ex colts on there and then the other ones play together now everyone plays together well but its just that we couldnt get the hits when we needed to tonight
420739 we probably had three solid hits in the whole game

420753 it was also observed that service organisations attempt to project a particular image to customers that may not reflect the reality within for instance by giving employees fancy designations to impress the client theres a difference between the way organisations really function internally and how they are demonstrated to others said one informant
420754 we must distinguish between what is claimed by managements or exists in the form of official policies and what actually happens
420755 these quality models prescribe rationalised and systematic processes for the organisation of work flows at every stage of the software cycle as well as for management practices the setting of specific productivity goals for each worker and team on a daily and weekly basis and detailed monitoring measuring reporting and evaluation of work completed
420756 a significant outcome of the rationalisation of software production is that programming and other it work are being reduced to measurable quantities of time effort productivity and output mimicking in many ways the old taylorist system of factory management
420757 hoher arbeitsdruck und unzureichende erholung bei der projektarbeit sind die ursachen daf r dass it fachleute h ufiger als andere berufsgruppen von stress und burnout betroffen sind 67 prozent der projektmitarbeiter verzichten immer oder oft bei berlast auf pausen 55 prozent schr nken f r den job ihre freizeitaktivit ten ein weitere 29 prozent tun das zumindest manchmal weit ber dem durchschnitt sind sie von m digkeit nervosit t schlafst rungen und magenschmerzen betroffen
420758 belegschaften in der it wirtschaft waren bisher eher jung fragen einer demografiegerechten und pr ventiv ausgerichteten betrieblichen personalpolitik spielten deshalb eine untergeordnete rolle
420759 vor dem hintergrund des demografischen wandels und den damit verbundenen m glichen engp ssen an qualifiziertem und erfahrenem personal stellt eine nachhaltige d h auf die langfristige erhaltung pflege und nutzung von humanressourcen abzielende personalpolitik einen wichtigen wettbewerbsfaktor dar das gilt auch und gerade in der wissens konomie die entscheidend f r mehr innovation besch ftigung und wachstum im rohstoffarmen deutschland ist
420760 zentrale fragestellung des projekts ist es wie besch ftigte in der it wirtschaft trotz hoher psychomentaler belastungen gesund bleiben k nnen und wie ihre arbeitsf higkeit ber unterschiedliche arbeitslebensphasen mit wechselnden belastungen hinweg erhalten und weiterentwickelt werden kann
420761 gesundheitliche belastungen in der it industrie von der zeitenwende zu einer neuen belastungskonstellation
420762 this cultural justification for long hours needs to be critically challenged for it is the social condition and status of the employees rather than a shared culture per se that accounts for this difference as relatively new players in the global it industry there is pressure to prove ones individual and collective capability
420763 on the issue of long working hours in the software industry industry spokespersons suggested that the high salary levels compensates for this level of commitment they also argued that because software engineers are self driven it is not possible to impose fixed working hours on them nor is it practically feasible to monitor and enforce official timings in any case the government should not impose regulations that would undercut the main advantage that the country has in the outsourcing industry flexibility in other words long working hours it was argued that because of the nature of the work in software companies there can be no restrictions either on breaks or on working hours
420764 reflecting the split between subjective and direct mechanisms of control software engineers are expected to be self managing and proactive but at the same time to follow process complete assigned work on time perform as team players and do everything to please the customer while they are exhorted to be more assertive from management point of view the passivity of indian engineers may be a positive trait in that they are said to be good at following directions and so are better able to adapt to the standardised quality processes typical of software factories
420765 thus cultural stereotyping in the global workplace is not a superficial phenomenon but performs a certain function in the regulation of work these images serve to slot indian software engineers into certain roles and positions they are considered to be passive and inefficient but also to work hard and with great dedication and competence they are technically very adept and good at following directions in contrast to the more creative and self driven european engineers as a result they are regarded by their european managers and customers as little more than techno coolies who have the technical skills needed for basic computer programming and systems maintenance work but lack the social and cultural capital soft skills required for more demanding roles
420766 the routinisation of work is a major complaint of many software engineers for one it reduces the scope for originality and individual initiative turning computer programming which for many programmers is a highly individualistic and creative activity into a kind of assembly line production system
420767 common reasons that were given for job dissatisfaction include the job is not interesting work is monotonous and i am stagnating a major reason for wanting to move to a new job is to get better work these responses suggest that a major reason for job dissatisfaction and consequent high attrition is the increasingly process driven nature of software production as well as the low end nature of much of the work available many software engineers complain about the routine boring and uncreative nature of their work and they seek more challenging work either by changing projects within the company or if that is not possible by changing companies
420768 but it is noteworthy that while customers find indian software engineers to be subservient their hr managers find them to be too assertive and demanding when it comes to their own compensation promotions and benefits
420769 so despite the flat structures employee empowerment and informality that are supposed to characterise these new workplaces there are conflicts and struggles over control however these do not usually take an overt form and the lines of confrontation are not clearly drawn as in labour disputes in traditional industries as discussed above the fuzziness of the line between worker and management in this industry and the fact that software engineers do not identify themselves as workers reduce the chances of such conflicts occurring however there are tensions between management practices and employees most of which are related to the systems of control that have been evolved to manage these knowledge workers
420770 i negotiate with my boss over the deadline and he in turn negotiates with the next guy this happens at the company level also when they have to give time estimates to the parent or customer its just like haggling over vegetables in the market
420771 woher kennen manager den richtigen zeitplan wir haben es ihnen beigebracht sie beobachten unsere gesichter wenn sie termine vorgeben wenn sich darin erleichterung spiegelt wissen sie dass sie die daumenschrauben nicht stark genug angezogen haben wenn wir sie auslachen ist ihnen klar dass sie zu weit gegangen sind
420772 they resent the amount of non productive reporting and documentation that is required by quality processes
420773 struggles over timesheets and metrics such as productivity are one area in which one might identify subtle forms of resistance on the part of employees
420774 more broadly the problems that software companies face in managing outsourced projects or virtual teams may arise simply from the struggles over time deadlines and allotment of work that take place within any software development team in this struggle rather than confronting the manager directly they may use indirect tactics to buy time or to avoid certain tasks such as repeatedly asking for instructions or not completing work unless reminded this behaviour pattern is then labelled by managers as stemming from indian cultural difference

420789 lets assume radio broadcasts do promote music which leads to greater sales
420790 dont radio broadcasts of sports games also promote the sale of tickets and team merchandise yet dont broadcasters pay to broadcast these games
420791 internet radio companies generated 150 million last year and they paid at least 50 percent and some paid 100 percent of their revenue
420792 meanwhile the broadcast industry generated 15 5 billion and they paid nothing

420838 our findings raise the possibility that the physical symptoms of depression are particularly toxic to the cardiovascular system
420839 identifying the most harmful aspect of depression is important because we will then know which specific components to target with our treatments
420840 our study is important because it is the first to simultaneously examine the links between all of these negative emotions and sub clinical atherosclerosis
420841 in addition we broke depression down into physical and cognitive emotion symptom clusters which is uncommon
420842 no secondary prevention trial has successfully reduced cardiovascular risk by targeting depression
420843 there currently exists no evidence that treating depression will help prevent heart disease
420844 the biggest reason is that studies that would be needed to draw that conclusion would have to be large and therefore very expensive
420845 hopefully an added bonus will be to reduce the risk of developing or suffering from heart disease
420846 ultimately we plan to use the data from this study and similar investigations to develop a psychological treatment for adults at risk for cardiovascular disease
420847 we hope that our treatment when combined with standard treatments will help to prevent the development of cardiovascular disease
420848 women are more likely to sacrifice their careers because mens careers are considered to be more important and the culture of taking care of children says that mothers should bear the primary responsibility for housework and health care
420849 even among very egalitarian couples children are considered to be the womans primary responsibility
420850 this highlights how difficult it can be for couples in which both spouses have demanding careers
420851 i dont think theres evidence that were reverting to more traditional patterns
420852 women are working more than ever and bringing in more family income than ever
420853 using il 8 as a biomarker to screen low risk septic shock patients from clinical trials of experimental or potentially high risk therapies is an effective strategy to improve the risk to benefit ratio of a given intervention
420854 excluding patients who respond to standard care would enable investigators to focus clinical trial enrollment on patients least likely to respond well to conventional methods and find the most effective new therapies
420855 we have evidence to suggest cr creatine uptake into muscles in copd patients but are unable to explain why an increase in muscle cr did not enhance training
420856 those of us interested in pulmonary rehabilitation are happy to see confirmation of the beneficial effects of exercise training this information indicates that creatine supplementation not be viewed as a substitute for exercise training
420857 this is the first study to demonstrate an independent association between all cause mortality and sleep apnea in a community based study
420858 the size of the increased mortality risk was surprisingly large
420859 in our particular study a sixfold increase means that having significant sleep apnea at age 40 gives you about the same mortality risk as somebody aged 57 who doesnt have sleep apnea
420860 our findings remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
420861 people who have or suspect that they have sleep apnea should consult their physicians about diagnosis and treatment options
420862 this australian data has additional strengths in that it is a population based prospective sample with a long period of follow up
420863 further work is needed to see if mild obstructive sleep apnea is associated with adverse effects and if continuous positive airway pressure treatment reduces cardiovascular risk in larger populations
420864 our findings of significant mortality risk with untreated sleep disordered breathing in conjunction with prior evidence that continuous positive airway pressure can effectively treat severe sleep disordered breathing underscore the immediate need for heightened clinical recognition and treatment of sleep disordered breathing
420865 in treatment nave patients atazanavir ritonavir once daily demonstrated similar antiviral efficacy to lopinavir ritonavir twice daily with less gastrointestinal toxicity but with a higher rate of hyperbilirubinaemia the results of this study support the use of once daily atazanavir ritonavir as a recommended first line treatment option with a number of patient benefits over the currently recommended ritonavir boosted twice daily lopinavir for the treatment of hiv infected antiretroviral naive patients
420866 methadone kills sensitive leukemia cells and also breaks treatment resistance but without any toxic effects on non leukemic blood cells
420867 we find this very exciting because once conventional treatments have failed a patient which occurs in old and also in young patients they have no other options
420868 addiction shouldnt be an unsolvable problem if methadone is ever used as an anti cancer therapy
420869 breast cancer shows up on a mammogram or imaging in two different ways a mass lesion or a spot
420870 we feel the breast ct was superior to traditional mammography for mass lesions but mammography remains superior over breast ct for microcalcifications
420871 one of the things that is appealing is comfort on the part of the patient
420872 it has to be just as accurate in finding breast cancer as mammography and should not generate a higher rate of false positives
420873 absolutely all the new things are wonderful in fact i have a new phone im using right now
420874 but ive always been well very healthy i dont go to doctors because i dont really need to and people have always been wonderful to me my two girls are exceptional and ive had a very happy marriage and a very pleasant place to live and i have a lot of friends mostly my daughters age of course thats the bad thing about getting old too many losses but im perfectly happy
420875 my biggest surprise was the level of technology that people over 100 were using
420876 the last time we did this survey we found that many people over 100 were using an ipod
420877 and this year we found that people were using google so this is a recurring theme and its because they are using this technology to stay in touch with friends and family
420878 in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to reevaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse
420879 mean greater morbidity and mortality for patients with greater social and economic harm for their families and communities in the longer term these standardized regimens may be contributing to amplification of multi drug resistance in these countries
420880 unless those with the responsibility to boost control and research efforts increase their commitments and their financial investments by several fold we may never see elimination of this major scourge in the decades to come
420881 rates of infection among african americans and also among hispanics are much higher than among white women sixty four percent of women with hiv are black even though blacks only make up about 13 percent of the u s population
420882 education plays an important role because hiv is more prevalent in their communities women of color need to know they are more likely to be exposed to hiv
420883 all women should understand how to protect themselves such as limiting their number of partners and using condoms consistently
420884 physicians can explain to their patients that hiv screening is recommended for all adults now and that there are numerous benefits to being tested we need to continue to destigmatize hiv screening and make it a part of routine care
420885 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
420886 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists synthetic molecules that mimic the action of natural molecules are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
420887 turning cb1 back on and than treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
420888 we live in times of great uncertainty when men of faith must stand up for our values and our traditions lest they be washed away in a sea of fear and relativism as you likely know i am running for president of the united states and i am asking for your support i have never been one who is comfortable talking about my faith in the political arena in fact the pandering that typically occurs in the election season i find to be distasteful but for those who have asked i freely confess that jesus christ is my personal savior and that i seek his guidance in all that i do i know as you do that our freedoms come not from man but from god my record of public service reflects my reverence for the natural rights with which we have been endowed by a loving creator

420943 if there is very unfavorable weather and the air quality is forecast to not be up to standard for the next 48 hours
420944 we expected that with the odd and even restrictions there would be no traffic jams and therefore fewer pollutants emitted but because of the special olympic driving lane there are still a few traffic jams so the emissions are higher than our predictions

420962 explains why women tended to exhibit more depression than men
420963 in many ways women are still only at the tip of the iceberg in terms of exploring the depths of the emotional social sexual occupational religious and political oppression they have endured
420964 it also means whenever possible inputting into these cultures that subconsciously darkened the presence of the person seeking help
420965 historically it was never a good development that people in emotional and social distress came under the umbrella of general medicine whilst i have no difficulty with short term psychotropic medication it needs to be seen that medication is not a therapy but only a symptom reducer
420966 the underlying conflicts continue to lurk below the tranquility surface that medication creates and will resurface as clients become tolerant to the toxic cocktail
420967 emotional distress usually precedes physical distress however some people appear to need the presence of physical disease as a passport to revealing their inner and outer disharmony for example asthma may represent the constrictions of the expression of thoughts and feelings and the belief that even if expressed they will not be accepted

421028 ciertamente estamos viendo y enfrentando una crisis alimentaria mundial que ha detonado el precio de los alimentos pero eso no justifica alzas tan elevadas como ha ocurrido con el frijol arroz y aceite comestible que s forman parte de la canasta b sica y no los 150 productos anunciados en el programa de congelamiento de precios
421029 el gobierno federal debe regular los precios de cuando menos diez de los principales productos b sicos para garantizar la alimentaci n adecuada de la poblaci n de lo contrario no s lo estaremos enfrentando una inflaci n desproporcionada sino el descontento social de millones de mexicanos que hacen lo imposible por subsistir

421034 estamos con toda apertura y claridad a discutir estas diferencias ver las alternativas que existan por el momento no existe un an lisis porcentual de las coincidencias o de las diferencias simplemente es un an lisis tem tico para poder avanzar

421039 es muy bueno estimular esta hermandad por la v a de destacar los hechos positivos
421040 pero as como lo reconocemos tambi n reafirmamos nuestra determinaci n total de arrestar a estos bandidos y en esta determinaci n nos ayuda el xito que ustedes puedan tener

421057 cualquier fen meno literario es digno de estudio pero en su caso estamos ante un cantautor de xito que ha demostrado que la calidad no est re ida con la comerciabilidad
421058 en el plano formal por su enorme riqueza verbal y l xica
421059 si lo comparamos con el contexto de la canci n ligera espa ola actual que es bastante preocupante porque se escuchan barbaridades y con una exhibici n de pobreza l xica y conceptual impresionante
421060 sus canciones est n cargadas de s miles de met foras de comparaciones con un enorme ingenio y resueltas con gran calidad literaria
421061 sus canciones son muy directas en ellas hay sexo drogas relaciones tienen una gran verdad humana pero con un envoltorio est tico perfecto
421062 viene de las letras es un tipo formado en filolog a hisp nica con muchas lecturas con mucha canci n extranjera y espa ola o da y que adem s se castiga y se corrige mucho
421063 hay expresi n l rica ntima testimonios de sus aventuras amorosas y de contenidos muy duros
421064 tienen dos audiciones una de lectura f cil para divertirse y otra para preocuparse
421065 su estilo se va cargando cada vez m s de valores literarios lo que le va llevando a una evoluci n que incluso creo que va a tener que reprimir si quiere seguir siendo un triunfador en la m sica espa ola porque sus preocupaciones literarias pueden entrar en colisi n con la comerciabilidad

421327 fire both natural and human caused has played a large role in shaping the ecology of mediterranean eco regions the hot dry summers make much of the region prone to fires and lightning caused fires occur with some frequency many of the plants are pyrophytes or fire loving adapted or even depending on fire for reproduction recycling of nutrients and the removal of dead or senescent vegetation in both the australian and californian mediterranean climate eco regions native peoples used fire extensively to clear brush and trees making way for the grasses and herbaceous vegetation that supported game animals and useful plants the plant communities in these areas adapted to the frequent human caused fires and pyrophyte species grew more common and more fire loving while plants that were poorly adapted to fire retreated after european colonization of these regions fires were suppressed which has caused some unintended consequences in these ecoregions fuel builds up so that when fires do come they are much more devastating and some species dependent on fire for their reproduction are now threatened the european shrublands have also been shaped by anthropogenic fire historically associated with transhumance herding of sheep and goats

421383 these nanojewels can potentially find application in photonics drug delivery special coatings sensors and microfluidics
421384 besides the dazzling look of these nanojewels the most exciting thing about this work is that it opens up many interesting possibilities in quickly and inexpensively making new materials with nanoparticles
421385 by understanding how different particle sizes determine the colors produced these nanojewels can be designed for applications in optical communication systems

421418 you know what i think i think that you wanted to be caught

421420 youre a proper prisoner now all bound and spread for me

421425 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
421426 his comments were clearly with the race card because of what he said everybody can read his remarks in fact his campaign retracted those remarks i was very disappointed i was very disappointed his campaign retracted those remarks so lets move on
421427 i dont think its negative i think were drawing differences between us i think that the video we had it was about taxes and about energy thats what we want this campaign to be about is the differences in our positions and why dont we stand together at a town hall meeting thats what we offered
421428 i dont respond to websites that i have no idea what theyre talking about
421429 i think that your governor has earned a place in the republican party not just in florida but nationally hes a great leader and i think that obviously he has a major role to play in the republican party in this nation in the future we arent talking about the process
421430 i dont respond to websites that i have no idea what theyre talking about
421431 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
421432 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
421433 we need to know exactly how mr ivins was involved if he was involved how this relates to the case and information that so far has been withheld from the american people ought to be provided
421434 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law
421435 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats plans and actions towards therapists
421436 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
421437 unfortunately the proposal would eliminate floridas 2006 gulf protections and give floridians absolutely no voice in determining where exploration could occur
421438 this council cannot ignore the terrible crimes that have occurred throughout the conflict in darfur
421439 no progress will be possible without the full cooperation of the sudanese government
421440 the question here is who is the bad actor if the u s wants to keep the pressure on bashir they dont want to suggest that somehow he is being unfairly targeted he is not
421441 the question of power has been settled by the elections
421442 it should be stressed that executive power will remain with the elected president
421443 no no no april i can tell already you wont do this right let me write this
421444 about getting married no i love fran oise i love your family and i love you
421445 i had such a crush on you in high school and now after all this time i have another chance
421446 crush in high school you were always breaking up with him planning to break up with him or at least wondering if you could do better then youd only get back together with him after you had a panic attack about being boyfriendless
421447 would you know my name if i saw you in heaven

421449 waiting till the snow melts to look for the body
421450 its a bonus for anyone like me who didnt know what to do with coins and didnt throw them away
421451 everyone is totally confused maybe things will settle down in a few days its farcical at the moment
421452 we promised to make norwich more fun and this is the latest example
421453 in the past when we have had a big screen for other events it has brought people together and created a wonderful atmosphere in the streets
421454 now we can do it whenever the city wants starting with the handover ceremony later this month
421455 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1 percent
421456 oncologists sensitively describe the benefits and limitations of any proposed palliative treatment including survival gain
421457 if the oncologist focuses on the benefits of palliative chemotherapy in terms of control of symptoms and quality of life but omits information about survival benefit the patient might assume much greater potential to prolong life than is likely to be the case
421458 we are very proud of his majesty he was under pressure to change and he has
421459 in fact he has done more than we could have hoped for
421460 in some places the church is ridiculed as the gay church so membership is lost it is experienced as a new form of colonisation
421461 it is seen as leading to sexual license bishops cannot be a symbol for unity when their consecration divides the church in some regions the issue has become a basis for hostile actions
421462 had no idea their action had caused such a negative impact
421463 the revisionists push upon us the view that current secular culture and not the bible should shape our mission and morals
421464 everywhere we go we meet gay and lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their events they seem to be supported by north american churches they are determined that their way is the only right way
421465 we have got to address the problem we experienced last year by not having a leadership election and a proper debate about the future of the party
421466 gordon brown should welcome that it is not the old politics of john major saying back me or sack me
421467 it is saying here is my politics and my ideology if people have other views let them name themselves and stand and lets have that debate and that leadership election
421468 we could have a leadership election which is open friendly and democratic and involves the whole country
421469 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
421470 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
421471 we need to know exactly how mr ivins was involved if he was involved how this relates to the case and information that so far has been withheld from the american people ought to be provided
421472 their tears are our smiles and in the end we will roar with laughter
421473 by freeing a murderer like de juana chaos the government has turned us into orphans
421474 we are here to tell the murderers we are going to fight to end the impunity they enjoy
421475 it would be inherently cruel to move her to mexico
421476 weve grown up with jenny shes our family she deserves better than getting sent to a drive through tourist attraction in mexico
421477 jennys situation is of great concern to many people i represent
421478 this is not an indictment of the zoo in mexico but jenny deserves to be somewhere she will be happy
421479 we know she is a nervous elephant and with protected contact she can approach people if she wants to and we can monitor her stress levels easily without anyone getting hurt or killed
421480 these animals need our help to protect their natural habitat as well as facilitate conservation programs throughout the country that are helping new generations of wildlife stewards and conservationists
421481 whenever you deal with children or animals you have to consider a lot of options
421482 were still trying to go through our plans and we usually have time to consider our options but with all the furor that weve had to go through weve had to be a little more outspoken about our choices
421483 we just feel this will make us better colletti said
421484 i think we know what were dealing with this guy has been on a lot of winning teams and has been a key player on a lot of winning teams
421485 we have players who have been teammates of ramirez colletti said
421486 i chatted with one of them whom i trust implicitly and he said we should do it
421487 my job is to find a way to make it work torre said
421488 to me that is a pretty good sign because they are usually the first ones to know about something they dont want in the clubhouse and that isnt the case with him
421489 he is an awesome guy and an awesome teammate said dodgers infielder nomar garciaparra who played with ramirez in boston from 2001 2004
421490 but he prefers to just go out there and play he is a quiet guy a shy guy he doesnt talk much and he doesnt like attention he just wants to show up at the ballpark play the game and go home to his family there are a lot of guys like that
421491 but his personality is really dwarfed by his pure baseball skills he is one of the greatest hitters in the history of baseball the fact he has some personality i thin thats kind of fun we obviously know manny wants to win and he has won
421492 this is when you yearn for the designated hitter torre said
421493 well kind of take it as we go along and figure it out i will probably have a meeting with the whole team just to give them my thoughts
421494 manny will obviously be in the middle of that lineup torre said
421495 he can obviously hit third or fourth or fifth but we want to get him up there as much as possible
421496 we have manny for the rest of this season mccourt said
421497 our focus is on winning a world championship what happens in the offseason will be dictated by ned and his people
421498 no trade is the final piece of the puzzle colletti said
421499 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
421500 boah ich finds grad so geil dass es regnet herrlich die scheiss hitze geht mir sowas von auf die nerven

421504 in case of the continuation of a downward trend in oil price one of the serious discussions in the next opec meeting will be definitely the quotas
421505 opec as the responsible body to control the market should be more meticulous for the control of quotas
421506 the member countries that have increased their capacity should control it the issue is that some countries have been supplying more than their quota

421513 orang yang berkerja dengan ikhlas itu akan memperoleh 2 kebahagiaan apabila pekerjaannya menuai hasil yang baik sedangkan orang yang bekerja dengan pamrih hanya akan memperoleh 1 kebahagiaan apabila pekerjaannya menuai hasil
421514 orang yang bekerja dengan mengharapkan pamrih akan bekerja sebaik mungkin dengan tujuan mengharapkan sesuatu apabila pekerjaannya berhasil maka dia hanya bahagia apabila yang diharapkan terpenuhi itu adalah 1 kebahagiaan namun apabila pekerjaannya berhasil tapi sesuatu yang diinginkan itu tidak diperoleh atau tidak diberikan atau imbalan dari pekerjaan tersebut tidak sesuai dengan yang dia harapkan maka dalam hatinya tidak akan ada kebahagiaan yang tersisa yang dia pikirkan hanyalan kegagalan memperoleh sesuatu yang dia harapkan itu
421515 nah orang yang bekerja dengan ikhlas karena tidak mengharapkan apapun apabila berkerja dan pekerjaannya menuai hasil maka akan memperoleh 1 kebahagiaan dan apabila sebagai efek dari pekerjaan itu dia memperoleh sesuatu imbalan maka dia akan memperoleh 2 kebahagiaan yaitu kebahagiaan karena pekerjaan berhasil dan kebahagiaan dan rasa syukur karena memperoleh imbalan sedangkan apabila dia tidak memperoleh apa apa hatinya tetap bahagia karena sejak awal memang tidak mengharapkan apapun hasil pekerjaannya tidak akan dirusak dengan penyesalan dan harapan yang tidak terpenuhi

421681 ich erkl re hiermit dass es niemanden gibt der auf seine nuklearen rechte verzichtet
421682 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
421683 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
421684 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
421685 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
421686 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
421687 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
421688 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
421689 if he rode past on his bike if he saw me working in the garden he would stop and say hi
421690 scott told me that a lot of teenagers go down there but i didnt know anything about that
421691 i was trying to act as calm as i could
421692 i didnt want to try to run away who knows what he would have done if i did
421693 they wanted me to describe what this guy looked like
421694 up until wednesday night he seemed like a normal nice guy
421695 my friend had to work otherwise we would have still been there
421696 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1 percent
421697 the first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices
421698 i dont think theres anything that would preclude us from working together how we cooperate thats the question
421699 are a rattly ship where theres no control over where these platforms are going
421700 the problem right now is there are too many open source players
421701 it doesnt make sense in a marketplace to have multiple vendors doing the same thing if you combine all that effort into one you should have a lot more effect
421702 more feasible for android to merge with limo than with symbian because the technology underpinnings are the same
421703 there are clear competitive reasons why nokia which owns all the intellectual property and will be the biggest contributor to the open source symbian foundation has no commercial incentive at all to work with google
421704 this is really nothing new weve seen linux consortiums come and go
421705 theres no question that the challenging macroeconomic environment in the u s has made it difficult to grow the top line
421706 the delays in purchases reflect economic anxieties far more than they do competitive positioning
421707 they have a client base largely comprised of telecom government and financial services customers and those segments have really slowed buying
421708 macroeconomic issues are the biggest issues a slowing economy and all the banks going out of business
421709 they have high exposure to legacy unix products that enterprises are moving away from
421710 we now enter yet another year where sun is hoping to grow slightly and expand its margins
421711 its been trying to do that the last three or four years so theres less and less investor confidence in the company
421712 most people buy on price they want to buy from the biggest vendors because they will give them the best deal in a down economy its an even harder sell for sun
421713 they have an expectation that their customers want to put it together and figure out how it works
421714 part of the problem is that they they havent done enough to reach out to the right partners to build an out of the box ecosystem of products they think too much about technology and need to think more about how all those pieces will work together
421715 laut polizei hat opa an seinem todestag versucht mich morgens um 6 40 uhr in frankfurt mit seinem handy anzurufen bestimmt war das ein hilferuf warum habe ich das blo nicht geh rt
421716 ja um 6 40 uhr und um 11 39 uhr hat ihr gro vater eine nummer in frankfurt gew hlt das handy haben wir neben ihm im gras gefunden
421717 ach um 11 39 uhr auch davon war bisher nicht die rede hat er denn innerhalb der f nf stunden die dazwischen liegen auch noch andere nummern versucht ich meine er muss ja dann noch gelebt haben und es ist doch verwunderlich dass er blo zwei mal versucht haben soll hilfe zu erhalten
421718 moment ich schaue im anrufprotokoll nach nein hat er nicht
421719 kommt ihnen das nicht komisch vor ich meine wenn man in einer notlage ist und so

421724 tja er sagt er w re es mit seiner familie gewesen
421725 und wieso ist er dann auf s gas getreten als er mich bemerkte
421726 aha und da kann man dann bestimmt auch nichts machen wie
421727 nein nach dem zustand der leiche muss es so ab mittag bis hin in den sp ten nachmittag passiert sein
421728 laut polizei hat opa an seinem todestag versucht mich morgens um 6 40 uhr in frankfurt mit

421739 things are pretty bad and the river is getting deeper faster and wider
421740 the question is can they get to other side before the cash runs out

421742 they are on the right path to make fuel efficient cars but its going to take time
421743 i do see more of a resolve we need to take these actions and focus on what we can control

421776 i am here to settle for once and for all the problems of constant serbian agitation and to demand justice for austria
421777 we see in yugoslavia how the proud name of nationalism can splinter a country into bloody civil war
421778 an end must be put to this tragedy which dishonors europe and the world in the last few days there have been attacks of incredible violence all over croatia but especially on dubrovnik and vukovar in dubrovnik a hotel and a hospital full of refugees and wounded has been hit among others if s aggression and it must end i beg the yugoslavian army to spare the lives of defenseless civilians
421779 almost 68 percent of bosnia is in danger of being eliminated people churches schools and homes this is the worst kind of terror we have experienced in the past seventy years
421780 what are they doing to protect the bosnians isnt that what they are supposed to be there for
421781 u n forces are actually working on the side of the serbs who are not supposed to be fighting inside captured bosnian territory patrolled by the u n but the serbs simply uses u n troops as a shield u n forces on the other hand prevent the bosnian forces from retaking territory lost to the serbs u n forces stand in their way but do nothing to prevent serbian forces from attacking from behind the blue helmets
421782 it just makes it easier for them to go on fighting theyd stop sooner if we left them to starve and die of their wounds or disease youve got to be cruel to be kind there are times when if s a rough decision to sit by and see others suffer but it is the right one all the same
421783 this is almost certain to occur once bosnia is finished off
421784 if people want to fight there are only two options either let them fight or separate them forcefully this implies that bosnia and croatia elected to fight serbian aggression for no valid reason with serbia as the aggressor and that this is a family quarrel or a civil war
421785 this is not an inter ethnic conflict but a crisis provoked by bolshevik serbian expansionism
421786 there is a very fine line between good offices and interference in internal affairs
421787 to enter on one side of the conflict would mean coming into conflict with others inside and outside of yugoslavia a conflict which could grow into an all european one
421788 our mission in yugoslavia has failed at the moment there is nothing that we can do here but we want the world to know that it was the serbian side that has been responsible for the collapse of the talks yugoslavia now faces tragedy and catastrophe
421789 the croats must move or die we dont want any other nationalities on our territories and we will fight for our true borders
421790 were sabotaged from the inside by britain and sources in jerusalem
421791 the european ministers know very well that it is an exercise in futility to try and stop the serbians who know that they are backed by london and washington hoot at our proposals nothing can be done to stop the serbian onslaught unless british and american support is withdrawn
421792 would we really go to war in yugoslavia would we die for zagreb surely not
421793 there is no place for these old animosities in the new europe and what we see now in yugoslavia is how the proud name of nationalism can splinter a country into civil war
421794 while the urgent work of democracy building and market reform moves forward some see in freedoms triumph a bitter harvest in this view the collapse of communism has thrown open a pandoras box of ancient ethnic hatreds resentment and even revenge all of europe has been awakened to the dangers of an old enemy nationalism animated by hatred unmoved by nobler ends this nationalism feeds on old stale prejudice teaches intolerance and suspicion and even racism and anti semitism
421795 recognition of croatia bosnia and slovenia at this time would signal the end of the negotiated process and would leave force and violence to settle the issue
421796 the united nations is totally discredited they do nothing to help the civilian population less still protect them from serbian atrocities the u n mission in bosnia in particular is a sham and a disgrace
421797 but the real benefit will come from a turning away from global politics
421798 would be unwise to arm the bosnian muslims as this would only tend to increase the level of violence that would block a peaceful settlement on which we are working
421799 everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers
421800 for them subjects like the nuclear issue are pretexts the key reason for the hostility of the enemies in the past 30 years against iran is that they want us to pull back so that they can say we have given in
421801 but the iranian people will resist with force against the enemies
421802 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
421803 i could probably drop a package of sweet n low and evacuate this building
421804 i want to look my fellow americans directly in the eye and declare to them i am not the anthrax killer
421805 i know nothing about the anthrax attacks i had absolutely nothing to do with this horrible crime
421806 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
421807 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions
421808 and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
421809 we will do what the law says but clearly the law is extreme and flawed and wrong
421810 that the abortion will terminate the life of a whole separate unique living human being
421811 we will do what the law says but clearly the law is extreme and flawed and wrong
421812 its my right and i dont want to alter my lifestyle
421813 im a skanky whore who has sex every hour and gets knocked up but doesnt want to suffer the consequences and yeah thats extreme but i will not allow someone to die
421814 its my right and i dont want to alter my lifestyle
421815 oh ma am i need to tell you that you are ending a human life
421816 oh really i didnt know what an abortion was wait maybe i should think this over never fucking thought about that you asshole

421826 however improvement in our relations requires an atmosphere that is free from terrorism
421827 we have a duty to ensure that our people prosper and progress in a secure environment
421828 the scourge of terrorism must be removed from our midst and criminals and terrorists must never go unpunished
421829 there can be no economic growth or development without peace and security we need to take all necessary measures to combat terrorism and trans national crimes like trafficking of women and children

421872 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
421873 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
421874 she was so much about being one with the world and mother nature and there was a certain amount of understanding in her that you could see behind her eyes

421879 best of all is michelle yeoh who radiates integrity in every role she takes on and who holds our attention as a powerful sorceress
421880 the backwards priorities of the town of lavonia are shocking and the pleasure taken by the townspeople is evidence that this is not a matter of a single mindedly misguided politician the protect the children family values rhetoric juxtaposed against the irresponsible spending of taxpayer dollars could not be more obvious
421881 ah ha can we say discipline and silencing this is something that daily occurs when feminists point out sexism we are simply too sensitive after all it is just a movie its just a little harmless fun my question is why we never consider the cost of having fun these events that seem harmless on television or in movies happen in real life if you were having a conversation with a rape survivor would you still think that it is funny to tell a rape joke could you look him or her in the eye and still continue to throw your head back and laugh as they told you what rape meant to them and how it affected their life but yeah its just a joke and it doesnt mean anything where is your fucking sense of humour damn it
421882 within hours the aggrieved trolls hit the phones bombarding her apartment with taxis pizzas escorts and threats of rape and violent death
421883 but casting sex work as terrible work and equating working in the sex industry with being a sex slave oh thats a conflation i really didnt think zinn would make but sadly i was very wrong le sigh labor analysis gets kinda hairy when it comes to sex work when youve got an aging white liberal dude at the helm
421884 so my personal lesson learned is to burn bridges trust yourself enough to know that what you stand for is right and you do not have to accept anything less out of an idea that you might one day need to cross a faulty bridge
421885 but come on youve spent the whole trailer pointing out how much ass she kicks and how shes a born hero but you finish with justice never looked so good and its not polite to hit a lady really
421886 the point about how the question why is too big and cumbersome while questions like what is preventing the victim from leaving tend to get more concrete answers
421887 im not proud of what i have done im committed to making wiser decisions and better choices
421888 im troubled quite frankly by the statement by mr price that hes not proud of what he did but hopes to make wiser decisions

421909 look ill show you how it stings but it will only sting if i make it angry
421910 because he is the best of all the drivers right now he is the only one that i see as totally complete as michael schumacher was
421911 drilling is out of the question because cheaper oil is not worth the possibility of damaging our precious landscapes or wildlife and we need to cut fossil fuel use because of global warming and high gas prices are the best thing to make that happen
421912 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
421913 but the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
421914 but lets say that is true what good is wind or solar going to be in that time frame to power cars you could say electric cars but not in this time frame you cannot replace the hundreds of millions of gas powered cars in the u s within this time frame can you explain what is going to happen to the batteries from the hundreds of millions of cars when they wear out
421915 replacing hundreds of millions of gas power cars within this time frame
421916 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
421917 do you think oil companies would sell oil to us consumers for one cent less than they could get from french consumers no where oil comes from has no effect on price
421918 then there are the distribution concerns and as youve mentioned battery concerns as it is well known that these batteries are every bit as bad for the environment as our other resources
421919 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
421920 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
421921 then you say in 30 years gas will be 12 a gallon if this drilling will not effect the price of oil dont you think gas will not increase more than 2 a gallon over a 15 20 year period
421922 as for car batteries let me clear up my statement i was talking about the batteries that will be in electric cars have you thought about how to dispose of those
421923 as for you so called correction about transmission lines going to the
421924 does it not matter to you that gas produced in america will keep the u
421925 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
421926 looks like the dems would rather go on a five week vacation than debate what to do about the price of gas
421927 new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
421928 i assume this would also be true for ocs oil
421929 technically the gift certificate was supposed to expire six months from now but i told them to put saturday on there i think the reasons why are quite obvious

422097 islam does not distinguish between the american people and the american government since both are in a state of war with islam
422098 after all these are the people who elect the american governments and who even elected president george bush for a second term in office despite their awareness of his agenda against islam despite witnessing bushs many brutal actions against the muslims these people re elected him they are the ones who pay the taxes that enable the american government and army to wage war and spill the blood of muslims

422108 we believe god wants revival to break out all across america but it will only happen as believers humble themselves and pray

422138 um dos principais motivos que levam os pa ses a lutarem para sediar uma edi o dos jogos ol mpicos a visibilidade que ganham com isso
422139 vivemos em um mundo globalizado e muitos dos neg cios internacionais s o feitos em cima do que as pessoas pensam sobre um determinado pa s as pessoas que negociam com a china n o conhecem de fato o pa s mas t m uma id ia formada sobre ele
422140 normalmente pensamos que o crescimento econ mico melhora a imagem de um pa s mas isso n o aconteceu com a china pequim tem a chance de melhorar sua imagem se tudo der certo durante os jogos ol mpicos o que pode ter efeito positivo at sobre a imagem do pa s se alguma coisa der errado entretanto a imagem da china s tem a piorar
422141 pequim dificilmente vai poder aproveitar t o bem quanto outras cidades j que por ser um pa s muito fechado os jornalistas v o abordar este lado mais negativo do pa s o que pode n o ajudar a imagem da cidade
422142 mas tem uma das melhores imagens de marca do mundo
422143 minhas pesquisas mostram que os brasileiros s o adorados em todo o mundo est o sempre entre os 10 preferidos de todos os pa ses pois s o vistos de forma simplista como pessoas divertidas e simp ticas

422232 me parece un cristiano cat lico apost lico romano de primera agua sic muy centrado supe conocer despu s el ideario que ten a sobre la democracia en una famosa conferencia que dio en el omb a principios de los 80 all habla de que no se pod a repetir un gobierno militar llamado por civiles porque los militares no est n preparados para eso ni para la represi n sino para el combate y la guerra
422233 en ella perdieron la vida contendientes de ambos sectores pero el hecho concreto que escapa al combate excluye cualquier conducta del general men ndez
422234 esta es una causa hu rfana de pruebas o cuando se dice que la v ctima no era montonero

422352 we go through this debriefing process at the end of each summer to help our interns process their experience and adjust back to their home culture
422353 in addition to serving them it helps us assess their experience on the field and learn how to improve next years program
422354 this program was for interns who wanted a deeper more intensive experience in spiritual growth and personal development while on the field
422355 some fields were already providing this type of mentoring but we wanted to expand it to a greater audience

422370 basil and gregory came from a remarkable family their sister macrina may have been its most powerful personality she devoted herself to the ascetic life shamed basil out of his youthful pride in his oratorical abilities and confronted gregory on basils death gregorys own account of her own deathbed conversation portrays a woman of deep piety and a formidable theological learning
422371 the clarification of the original creed of nicaea reflects important theological advances made by basil of caesarea 330 79 his brother gregory of nyssa 331 40 395 and basils friend gregory of nazianzus c 329 390 these three are often referred to as the cappadocian fathers because the came from the central region of asia minor
422372 once elected bishop of caesarea basil worked to reconcile west and east old and new nicenes in the struggle with arianism
422373 the organization of charity during a period of frequent famine he set up a relief city the organization of community living the monastic life he composed major and minor rules and a concern to orthodoxy in a period troubled by the arian disputes
422374 the second of basils associates was his younger brother gregory of nyssa but he surpassed both basil and gregory of nazianzus in theological depth and penetration his extensive writings which mostly came from the period after his brothers death when gregory took up his pen to defend and develop basils teaching

422392 the idea that gastronomy and sex are related is not new its been expressed through art literature early science in locker rooms beauty salons and on the street some examples of these expressions are included as context for the aphrodisiac recipes which follow for millennia cooks have prepared dishes enriched with ingredients they judged to be sensually invigorating and this tradition continues today some approaches are humorous while others are doubting and satirical yet others are ponderously medical this book is none of the above it offers an anthropological approach to the spicy life of love and food which includes cross cultural historical and current views it is the kind of natural history which consists of culinary history and recipes in equal measure after all the mind which is perhaps the most potent aphrodisiac should be cultivated in equal measure to the body which is physically stirred by erotic passion

422399 in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of benazir bhutto
422400 while existing on the absolute fringes of our tolerant and peace loving societies terrorists in our region receive institutional nurturing and support it is this embedded nature of terrorism that make it a much more sinister threat
422401 while the people of afghanistan today are bearing the brunt of international terrorism on a daily basis it is with tremendous trepidation that we are watching the wild fire of terrorism spreading across the region
422402 it is time we all realise that the pursuit of narrow geo political interest and the use of militant radicalism as instrument of policy cannot succeed or serve any long term purpose
422403 in a region prone to many challenges terrorism may well prove to be the most destabilising
422404 never before has there been a greater need for collective action against terrorism as today
422405 i am hopeful that nsg will appreciate indias position and go ahead with the clean waiver
422406 of course in international affairs we have to wait till it happens on the ground level
422407 that was the wrong course of action instead of having a five minute chat with him youve now given him work it will be last thing on his task list because it is not his work hell tell his boss who will ask to see the questions his boss will fly off the handle because marketing is forcing a bunch of work on his already over committed team hell fire off a nastygram to the marketing director the marketing director will email the pr manager the pr manager will ring me and tell me to fix it

422444 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
422445 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
422446 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
422447 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
422448 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
422449 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
422450 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
422451 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
422452 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
422453 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
422454 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
422455 most of the things we depend upon would be gone and we would literally be depending on our own assets and those we could reach by walking to them
422456 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
422457 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
422458 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
422459 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
422460 one of the nations in the middle east had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel they had taken a short range probably scud missile put it on a transporter erector launcher lowered it in taken the vessel out into the water peeled back the top erected it fired it lowered it and covered it up and the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50 60 100 other ships operating in the immediate area
422461 well known to the white house but have not been disseminated to the appropriate congressional committees
422462 could be used in a devastating stealth attack against the united states or israel for which the united states has no known or planned defense
422463 the use of an atomic bomb against israel would destroy israel completely while the same against the islamic only would cause damages such a scenario is not inconceivable
422464 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
422465 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
422466 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
422467 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
422468 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
422469 as of today we have no defense against such an attack we need space based missile defenses to protect against an emp attack
422470 nuclear missiles dont discriminate on party lines when they land
422471 senator obama has been quoted as saying i dont agree with a missile defense system and that we can cut 10 billion of the research out never mind as i say that the entire budget is 9 6 billion or 9 3 billion
422472 needs a missile defense that is so strong in all the different phases we need to defend against that countries will decide its not worth coming up against us
422473 thats one of the things that defeated the soviet union

422475 the true cost of this measure to venezuelan society is open to debate
422476 its possible that santander saw the clouds gathering on the venezuelan economy and is relieved to just get out
422477 but this move also destroys some of the pragmatism recently introduced into policies trying to stave off a crisis among the banks

422481 my mechanics have fallen into place over the last three or four games and im able to throw all of my pitches over for strikes now and stay away from the big inning
422482 throwing first pitch strikes i had some easy innings and it allowed me to stay out there

422485 we cannot remain and share responsibility for what has been done by the prime minister
422486 ten ministers including myself have so far resigned from the government of nur adde hasan husein and two of them are deputy prime ministers
422487 no initiatives were launched in parliament for the last seven months and there was a total misuse of the nations resources while the government also failed to ensure security

422508 by creating him and ordering him with wisdom and love to his final end through the law which is inscribed in his heart the natural law
422509 both the old and new testaments explicitly affirm that without love of neighbor made concrete in keeping the commandments genuine love for god is not possible
422510 if you wish to be perfect sell what you possess and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and come follow me
422511 jesus brings gods commandments to fulfillment particularly the commandment of love of neighbor by interiorizing their demands and by bringing out their fullest meaning love of neighbor springs from a loving heart which precisely because it loves is ready to live out the loftiest challenges jesus shows that the commandments must not be understood as a minimum limit not to be gone beyond but rather as a path involving a moral and spiritual journey towards perfection at the heart of which is love
422512 perfection demands that maturity in self giving to which human freedom is called
422513 if you would be perfect sell what you have and follow me

422523 it was really the first time that we encountered such a character as anne shirley who was so imaginative was always getting into trouble and really was set apart by her intelligence more than anything else
422524 almost has a plot that were not used to seeing anymore
422525 a very picaresque plot where we see anne get into one scrape after another and always sort of come out of them on the other side because she meant well and things just go awry
422526 as a child i thought canada was this beautiful unspoiled paradise
422527 anne is constantly disappointed by the real names of places and is giving them more elaborate names that actually capture the beauty that she sees in them
422528 and theres this great line that says life still called to her with many insistent voices

422558 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under the us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
422559 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
422560 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
422561 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who to be replaced and who to be appointed to which position
422562 in america they went crazy realising karadzic was making a fool of them
422563 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic
422564 police do not suspect foul play at this stage but circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated

422567 the clash between the rat and the horse is a serious clash between water and fire
422568 for people born in the year of the horse it is recommended that they wear a pendant of an ox which will help to attract away the rat so as to minimise the influence of the clash
422569 the traditional belief is that you need an animal to attract away the rat

422790 st petersburg u s sen barack obama said today he would be willing to open floridas coast for more oil drilling if it meant winning approval for broad energy changes
422791 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
422792 so what theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama you know hes new he doesnt look like the other presidents on the currency hes got a funny name i mean thats basically the argument hes too risky
422793 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
422794 it celebrates the excitement that he has generated that is certainly more akin to the excitement that a celebrity generates than a normal politician
422795 the mccain campaign has very clearly decided that the only way to win this election is to become very personal and very negative we believe that people will see that as nothing more than the same old politics and the same old policies of the last eight years

422823 anything we can do to put employees in a position where they can perform at their best where things of a personal nature are not a distraction is of great value
422824 well be looking at whether peoples financial lives improve and whether it makes a difference in terms of absenteeism and retention which are some of the business drivers that would make employers want to consider offering these kinds of programs for their employees
422825 i was spending a little bit more than i thought buying clothes going out i dont go out as much as i used to

422828 given that cook county has a superior web site we as individual homeowners should be able to file our own appeal
422829 no homeowner should feel that they have to hire a professional bigwig to do it unless they are strapped for time or they feel a bit intimidated try to do it on your own at least on the ground level at the assessors office
422830 we advise people to not even bring that up because its totally ineffective
422831 i literally saw someone with a small kid in tow dressed as pathetically as they could be and said they were going to lose their home they were being totally honest it has zero effect dont even waste the assessors time

422846 for the first time in genesis god finds something not good man is alone a flaw in gods paradise hadnt god foreseen this did he assume he was to be adams partner and so eve is created but when it comes to making a helper fit for man the lord does not once again go to the ground but rather takes part of the man to form the woman to do this god has to put the conscious being into unconsciousness the woman like the man was especially created god does not consult with adam or get adams approval god takes the initiative the man is passive the woman is made to share adams life and to be his helper but clearly being a helper does not imply inferiority woman is a helper equal to man the solution to mans problem his aloneness is found in man not in the stars each human since adam is really brought forth from the side of humanity from humans who already exist we are dependent on one another each human conceived is a fit helper for other humans and each has a god ordained role in the universe we each are bearers of the image of god having a soul where gods own breath interacts with our physical nature
422847 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
422848 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
422849 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
422850 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
422851 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
422852 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
422853 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
422854 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
422855 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today
422856 we need to know exactly how mr ivins was involved if he was involved how this relates to the case and information that so far has been withheld from the american people ought to be provided

422897 these activities fall into the area of electromagnetics and rf radio frequency microwave systems with emphasis on multifunctional and adaptive mobile radio communications systems
422898 we are developing mobile wireless communications systems that are adaptive multifunctional and reconfigurable in response to the armys transformation to a lighter more rapidly deployable force
422899 effectively integrates research and education with the excitement of discovery allowing our students to explore the most forefront antenna systems
422900 this will support our teaching activities in the areas of rf microwave engineering and antennas where the students are exposed to innovative device concepts and mircofabrication technologies
422901 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
422902 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
422903 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
422904 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
422905 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
422906 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
422907 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
422908 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
422909 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
422910 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
422911 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

422921 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
422922 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
422923 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
422924 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
422925 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
422926 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
422927 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
422928 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
422929 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
422930 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
422931 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
422932 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
422933 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
422934 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
422935 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
422936 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
422937 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
422938 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
422939 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

422972 i entered the gym area in aztec dress i had on a leather top arm bands and loin cloth with a jaguar imaged headgear propped on my head and bells strapped around my ankles
422973 i noticed one woman with long luxurious black hair embracing cinnamon colored skin who danced as if she were outside by herself in the rain or beneath a starry sky just for me
422974 viviana taught me poetry not the words or forms of it the feel of it the soul touch she gave me the way her words clutched at some dark and secret place inside of me she had a way of saying almost nothing but when she did speak her words radiated with truth and power i looked forward to the visits i didnt even mind the dudes i had to go around or ride past in silence to get there or her brothers for viviana i would have done anything
422975 ive been a red hot ball bouncing around from here to there anyone can bounce me
422976 somehow i could tell something about being in jail changes a dudes expression his voice how he feels to touch
422977 the place swarmed with perfumed and preened young women and dudes with plastered down hair and oven heated shined shoes
422978 these classes are privileges for those who have maintained the proper grades in the requared courses
422979 my eyes crossed over several rows of faces to the direction of my family they were all on their feet my sisters had their hands up to their mouths joe looked awkward like he didnt know whether to congratulate me for trying or to give his condolences and mama i could see mama had been crying
422980 i emerged from the car and perhaps ten 38 revolvers were pointed at my head they told us to lie on the ground with our hands on our heads
422981 she looked fine 14 years old but shaped like a full grown woman
422982 there are are choies you have to make not just once but ever time they come up
422983 has we approached the gray house it looked like a tornado hit the place the bikers were scrambling about outside a couple of bodies were on the ground dario pulled up and i stuck the rifle out the side window
422984 through the tear gas mist i saw shadows of children crying women yelling and people lying on the grass kicking and gouging as officers thrust black jacks into ribs and spines
422985 the world fell into dust piles around me images of the past pitched by my brother tossing me off rooftops my mothers hearty laughter my fathers thin and tired face the end of fear dont close the door mama im scared its okay mijo theres no monsters well be here dont be scared
422986 viviana taught me poetry not the words or forms of it the feel of it the soul touch she gave me the way her words clutched at some dark and secret place inside of me she had a way of saying almost nothing but when she did speak her words radiated with truth and power i looked forward to the visits i didnt even mind the dudes i had to go around or ride past in silence to get there or her brothers for viviana i would have done anything

423047 i dont know it turns out the fire was in the underground car park as you can imagine burning cars make a lot of smoke fortunately my mini wasnt in there and i was able to use it to help ferry people too frail or shaken up to walk across to the church hall the fire brigade thought wed be able to go back tomorrow but they have to check its safe first i came here as soon as i could because i knew youd all be waiting

423393 we turned to several western clinics many of them refused to take us and the cost of treatment in others is just inconceivable half a million dollars suddenly doctors from tel aviv offered us a radical and the only chance a new operation in the mri shots they saw an opportunity to remove the major part of the rest of the tumor and perhaps the entire tumor its risky but without the operation gavryushas chance to survive is too little
423394 the boy is ready for the operation we shouldnt postpone it otherwise the tumor may start growing again
423395 this boy has ependymoma of the third stage the rest of the tumor must be removed whatever and after the rehabilitation radiotherapy must be started well its not that safe to apply radiation but well affect only the cranial fossa the parts of the brain that are responsible for intellectual development will stay intact

423425 this year the multinational record labels will only release about 40 records by brazilian artists while tecnobrega artists will release around 400
423426 the record industry argues if intellectual property isnt protected there will be no innovation but tecnobrega has shown thats not true
423427 piracy in brazil is undermining the ability of the music and film industries to invest in the next generation of local talent lower revenues from current sales mean less money to invest in new artists

423438 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
423439 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
423440 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
423441 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
423442 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
423443 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
423444 who are open to doing something on the production side
423445 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
423446 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
423447 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
423448 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
423449 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
423450 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
423451 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
423452 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
423453 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
423454 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
423455 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
423456 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
423457 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
423458 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
423459 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
423460 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
423461 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
423462 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
423463 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
423464 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
423465 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
423466 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
423467 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
423468 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

423474 pretendo un poco m s de mitad de cancha hacia arriba ah me est faltando algo
423475 hay algunas cuestiones de acuerdo a los sistemas t cticos que se ven an manejando que a los jugadores les hizo perder algunas cosas sobre todo a los delanteros est n acostumbrados a jugar de espaldas a que las jugadas terminen por afuera y en centros entonces dejan de perfilarse de recibir c modos y estar preparados para apuntarle al arco
423476 por eso ahora con un enganche hay que cambiar su manera de jugar y estar preparados para recibir pases gol en este sentido un pase gol no depende s lo del que lo lanza si no de la posici n del delantero para aprovecharlo
423477 otros como estudiantes tambi n tienen buenos lanzadores en los ltimos tiempos excepto por el kily por izquierda central no tuvo uno y pretendo que lo tenga y as disponer de otras opciones

423481 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
423482 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
423483 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
423484 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
423485 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
423486 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
423487 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
423488 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
423489 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
423490 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
423491 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
423492 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
423493 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
423494 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
423495 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
423496 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
423497 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
423498 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
423499 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
423500 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
423501 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
423502 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
423503 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
423504 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
423505 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
423506 debemos mirar todo lo que nos rodea y lo que nos pas no para lamentarnos o acusarnos simplemente para saber cu l es el camino acertado en materia pol tica econ mica y social no quiere decir que todos seamos homog neos que todos repitamos exactamente la misma marchita o cantemos al un sono

423517 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
423518 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
423519 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
423520 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
423521 with 19 9b in cdos still frozen on the balance sheet and with counterparty risk rising on the hedges underlying these troubled positions the potential for additional material write downs remains a concern
423522 it grieves me to see what singapore is doing they are going to lose money

423524 i saw the interview on tv last night and felt shortchanged
423525 he brushed aside the issues with the logic that since the officers who made the decisions were not the beneficiaries in any sense of the word such lapses are mistakes and are therefore acceptable

423531 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
423532 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
423533 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
423534 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
423535 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
423536 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
423537 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
423538 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things

423561 as far as im concerned a competitor is a competitor were all going for the same thing so its not just going to be sanya it could be some unknown from some tiny country youve never heard of
423562 the olympics only comes once every four years and people are going to go for that so you never know
423563 i shouldnt have been so hard on myself at crystal palace
423564 i did what i had to do on the day
423565 now ive kind of slept on it im ok with it now i just thought it felt faster thats all
423566 i dont need to race again im all right my coach puts down the standard and i just do it
423567 he knows me well enough now he lays down what im going to do thats his judgment and i respect that
423568 its a long season so whats the point coming and running flat out now if you dont peak for the games
423569 then youve got another month of racing after that its a very long season and these guys have been running since april so it doesnt make any sense you know youve got another three weeks to go
423570 when you run fast you put a strain on your body and thats when you can get injured
423571 you have to be mindful of the fact that every time you run fast your body is getting weaker going faster than your body has ever been before that makes you more likely to get an injury you dont want to take chances
423572 if its normal or not i dont really care as far as im concerned things in my head are normal and thats the most important thing
423573 it doesnt really help me now so i block it out i just get rid of it
423574 it doesnt irritate me that it will always be written about me its something ive learned to accept
423575 unfortunately that comes from what happened and thats something im going to have to deal with
423576 its not something i like not something im pleased about but unfortunately thats just how it is and such is life
423577 i think drugs is a very horrible taboo subject and i dont think ill ever get rid of that
423578 its something ive learned to accept ill just keep working as hard as i can it doesnt affect me that much
423579 people ask me if it changed me all the media glare i dont think it did i think it just defined who i was
423580 im not a different person for doing what i did im just the same person im just a bit more robust than i would have been

423586 its a great time of year especially if you are fighting for something there is a lot to play for at both the top end and the bottom end of the six and just underneath that
423587 there is a whole host of clubs pushing hard and fighting for that spot so its definitely a good time
423588 quins are a very resilient side who hang in there and they have a good work ethic
423589 they also have some very good players something that isnt always acknowledged like henry paul rob purdham and scott hill i have a lot of time for those sorts of players
423590 its the sort of game we would want after the semi final because you have to be on the ball against saints or you could get embarrassed
423591 its not about getting knocked down its about getting back up and the only way of doing that is by playing well we have to do that this week because saints are pretty hot at the minute
423592 they have got some quality players with ball in hand in brent sherwin and luke dorn
423593 defensively we are going to have to be on the top of our game again they have some unpredictability in them and they are going to throw the ball around

423603 ive been in business for 23 years and have never had a visit yet as if to say im not going to get caught out because whos going to tell on me and that probably used to be true however nowadays even when a labour government employs a veritable army of elf and safety inspectors and they have more powers than ever that may not be the problem the problem may be that in an increasingly litigious environment a greedy staff member may use any breach as grounds to force their personal injury case to court to get some more of your hard earned cash dont think this doesnt happen or its just unquantifiable scaremongering because in the last few years there have been literally dozens of cases going to court and winning substantial sums form their employers in 2000 alone there were 194 successful cases where employees won an average of 6 500 for just having inappropriate chairs in their workplace the message get your house or more importantly office in order it doesnt mean go over the top with regulations but just make certain that your procedures are in place and they are being followed and documented most of it comes down to common sense and just making sure that your staff are using theirs it doesnt have to be a pig of a job but rather that than someone raids your piggy bank for further information regarding our range of reception

423616 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done

423626 we hope this memorial will speak to visitors so they can understand the impact of these horrific events we would like to thank the department for
423627 using the language of architecture to make order out of chaos this monument is an opportunity for lost victims to be in contact with the living through a process of discovery where the memorials structure becomes complete through the presence and body language of a curious visitor

423634 in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of benazir bhutto
423635 while existing on the absolute fringes of our tolerant and peace loving societies terrorists in our region receive institutional nurturing and support it is this embedded nature of terrorists that make it a much more sinister threat
423636 while the people of afghanistan today are bearing the brunt of international terrorism on a daily basis it is with tremendous trepidation that we are watching the wild fire of terrorism spreading across the region
423637 it is time we all realise that the pursuit of narrow geo political interest and the use of militant radicalism as instrument of policy cannot succeed or serve any long term purpose
423638 in a region prone to many challenges terrorism may well prove to be the most destabilising

423652 i am left asking myself why the green media have neglected the water aspect of pickens wind farm plans have we been so distracted by the prospect of texas renewable energy portfolio growing by 4000 megawatts that we are willing to overlook some potentially dodgy aspects to the project

423666 canadian police today identified the 40 year old man who witnesses say stabbed and decapitated a fellow greyhound bus passenger wednesday night on a remote stretch of highway
423667 ive said from the first day of practice that i thought we would compete well but that the level of competition would make wins difficult to come by
423668 it would be great to get one of these wins against teams that are going to be in the ncaa tournament
423669 every game there seems to be one or two plays that teams like pepperdine make that we arent making thats the difference between losing 30 28 and winning 30 28 and thats the difference between a top 25 team and a first year division i program
423670 fresno always has a solid team and this year is no exception
423671 but i was very disappointed with our effort we have the talent to be a very good team but were not going to win a lot of matches with the effort we gave tonight
423672 were playing three tough ncaa division i opponents this weekend with a combined record of 21 6 were going to need to step our effort level up a lot if we hope to be competitive
423673 we didnt compete well tonight and when that happens against a team as talented as pacific this is the result
423674 we didnt play poorly but we werent ready to play and pacific is very physical and very skilled
423675 i always remember tim being an awesome guy with a wicked sense of humor
423676 i will never understand how a person could hurt someone like this my heart goes out to his family and loved ones rest in peace tim

423678 he would never pick a fight he wouldnt intimidate the guy
423679 there was no rage or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
423680 it is about direct action outside the camp we will break the law or do whatever needs to take place to stop e on peacefully from profiting from climate change last year they made 4 2 billion in profit from creating climate change
423681 we are planning to shut the coal fired power station down and we are planning to come back when they create a new coal fired power station because we are the last generation that can do it and if we dont then there is no future for any of us
423682 theres little doubt that if we burn all of the coal that sits below the earths surface we can return the planet to the condition it was in 50 million years ago when the antarctic was a tropical forest and much of the rest of the planet would be pretty difficult for human beings to live on
423683 weve got to see that coal is not a useful resource to burn unless we can recapture the carbon that is produced by burning it
423684 we therefore need to work positively towards carbon capture and storage if we can manage that then of course we can continue to use coal to drive our economies but frankly i havent seen the proof that that can be done
423685 about bloody time did i tell you perry about the time we took algy for a trip to the marshes bloody fool wouldnt know one end of a gun from another

423799 if you confess with your mouth that jesus is lord
423800 and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved
423801 even if we or an angel from heaven should preach other than the one weve preached to you let him be eternally condemned
423802 many deceivers who do not acknowledge jesus christ as coming in the flesh have gone out into the world any such person is the deceiver and the anti christ watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for but that you may be rewarded fully anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of christ does not have god whoever continues in the teaching has both the father and the son if anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching do not bring him into your house or welcome him anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work
423803 you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy an idolater or slanderer or drunkard or a swindler with such a man do not even eat

423806 love comes from god everyone who loves has been born of god and knows gods whoever does not love does not know god because god is love so you must know god

423810 now brothers i want to remind you of the gospel i preached to you which you received and on which you have taken your stand by this gospel you are saved if you hold firmly to the word i preached to you otherwise you have believed in vain for what i have received i passed on to you as of first importance that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures he was buried and he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures and that he appeared to peter and then to the twelve
423811 todays public comments by manchester uniteds manager announcing that he has made an offer for dimitar and is confident that the deal will go through with time working in their favour is a blatant example of sheer arrogance and interference with one of our players
423812 it is also probably one of the worst offences by any manager in the premier league to date and is unbelievably hypocritical given his recent comments in respect of cristiano ronaldo and real madrid
423813 as a result we have today made an official complaint to the pl about the conduct of manchester united
423814 we told both clubs very early on that we had no interest in selling robbie or dimitar respectively and that they should refrain from pursuing the player both clubs arrogantly chose to ignore this request and we now have evidence that both clubs have systematically been working to prise the players away from us outside of pl rules of conduct
423815 it is hypocrisy personified that spurs are complaining about things they themselves have done
423816 they took away our coach tottenhams style is demonstrated by the way they contacted juande ramos
423817 they made an excellent dizzying offer but im under contract to sevilla and my decision is to fulfil it
423818 there was not the slightest possibility that i would accept it because im under contract it did not interest me or the club i havent spoken to the club sevilla because there was no possibility of me accepting it

423899 fear limits our ability to be rational fear is the root of other repressive and painful feelings it prevents us from expressing ourselves honestly and stops us from responding in appropriate ways to threatening situations we renewed our relationship to god in steps 2 and 3 and now we ask god for help we will look closely at our personal histories and we will recognize the need for change this task will be much easier if we just remember that god is with us with gods help we can courageously resentment and anger keep us focused on the person or situation causing the negative feelings and prevent us from accepting gods blaming others for our misfortunes denying responsibility for hurtful behavior and resisting the truth are behavior patterns we must discard
423900 my dear brothers take note of this everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and slow to become angry for mans anger does not bring about the righteous life that god desires therefore get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you which can save you
423901 let us examine our ways and test them and let us return to the lord
423902 personal examination of our lives will give us insight into the ways in which we have turned away from god and become self destructive
423903 i have been self destructive lots in my life i have spent a lot of time beating myself up and telling myself how wrong i am this is a great opportunity to stop being unkind to me and showing myself that i am a valuable loved and wanted human being
423904 search me o god and know my heart test me and know my anxious thoughts
423905 we extend our trust in god by asking him to be part of our process of self discovery
423906 we need to learn the lovely transforming secret of a thought life brought completely and unbrokenly under the control of the holy spirit of love let not my heart be drawn to evil but my eyes are fixed on you o sovereign lord psalm 141 4 8
423907 well im feeling much stronger now i think i can handle it from here

423914 se qualche uomo sta lottando per un ettaro di terra una casa una scuola o per sfamarsi se qualche uomo si stancato di girare a capo chino in quel momento e in quel posto puoi trovarmi non sto facendo questa guerra per la fede in un partito non combatto per servire una bandiera ma per lo sguardo stupito e gli occhi dolci dei bambini che ho incontrato sulle strade di guerriero
423915 no eye has seen no ear has heard no mind has conceived what god has prepared for those who love him
423916 for who has known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him
423917 28 and afterward i will pour out my spirit on all people your sons and daughters will prophesy your old men will dream dreams your young men will see visions 29even on my servants both men and women i will pour out my spirit in those days
423918 preach the word be prepared in season and out of season correct rebuke and encourage with great patience and careful instruction
423919 but the counselor the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name will teach you all things and will remind you of everything i have said to you
423920 ask seek knock and the door will be open for you
423921 if you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him
423922 this is the confidence we have in approaching god that
423923 but everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening encouragement and comfort
423924 instead of having ministry anointing and accuracy as the goal we must have the heart of jesus as the goal
423925 at this i fell at his feet to worship him
423926 do not do it i am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers who hold to the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy
423927 and we who with unveiled faces being without a veil denotes intimacy and familiarity all reflect the lords glory are being transformed into his likeness with ever increasing glory which comes from the lord who is the spirit
423928 the lord your god is with you he is mighty to save he will take great delight in you he will quiet you with his love he will rejoice over you with singing
423929 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self control against such things there is no law
423930 for we know in part and we prophesy in part
423931 3 do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit but in humility consider others better than yourselves 4 each of you should look not only to your own interests but also to the interests of others 5 your attitude should be the same as that of christ jesus 6 who being in very nature god did not consider equality with god something to be grasped 7 but made himself nothing taking the very nature of a servant being made in human likeness

423987 appear to misunderstand and subsequently misrepresent the substance of church teaching on these difficult but important ethical questions
423988 our moral obligations to patients who exist in what has come to be called a persistent vegetative state
423989 m y father has judged that the burden of persisting in a vegetative state far outweighs the benefit of being sustained that way this in my view is a very catholic way of thinking
423990 that claim has no foundation in the text and is actually contradicted
423991 the church insists on the important distinction between validly withdrawing a life sustaining means because the means itself is burdensome and wrongly withdrawing it because in someones view life itself has become burdensome
423992 by omitting food and fluids what are we trying to achieve
423993 whose burden are we trying to ease assisted feeding is often not difficult or costly to provide in itself but the housing nursing care and other basic needs of a helpless patient can be significant to discontinue assisted feeding in order to be freed from such burdens puts the caregivers interests ahead of the patients even if we prefer not to recognize the reality of our choice

424031 gas cans were taken gas cans with gasoline probably 50 worth i found out who took them and they were returned and that was the extent of it
424032 the only think right now detectives are things that maybe it was taken for the car
424033 its always good to know that there is more people looking for caylee i mean thats our whole focus to find caylee
424034 ive been saying over and over again pieces are starting to come together
424035 what we want to say to her and to rest of the family is please share the information with us anybody
424036 i know i dont know where caylee is i just met with the detectives this afternoon and they didnt say anything about her having any information that right now would help us locate caylee any quicker
424037 we still feel that the key lies with casey and if she would just open up and just tell us where caylee is this could very well end quickly
424038 casey has given them as much information as she feels comfortable that she can say without jeopardizing the safety of caylee and her family

424050 o dat ging heel eenvoudig hoor dokter mijn vrouw ging op de keukentafel liggen ik ging in de la staan en mijn schoonmoeder heeft de lade open en dicht gedaan
424051 dat zal wel maar dat hoeft toch niet zo duur te zijn

424053 as far as wingnuts go dana is pretty goddamn well grounded
424054 aw dont be dissin dana for a wingnut hes not half bad

424099 the medic had prescribed an antibiotic which does not contain this substance is allowed and was declared at the time of the urine test he doesnt know how to explain this result
424100 im disconcerted sad and its an ugly thing for the world of fencing
424101 its not going to get any more pressurised or theres not going to be more going on than playing in the last round of the us open with tiger i tried to carry on that confidence that i built up there into this event
424102 this is a golf course ive played well on in the past ive shot 63 around here and i think i hold the lowest score for the back nine its just a golf course that i stand on and a lot of shots suit my eye
424103 she is unlikely to take part in the beam and the vault
424104 we have got to get out of the intermediate league in the first year there is no question about that
424105 there is pressure on everyone at the club to deliver that the fans have got to rally behind the team and i can assure them that myself and the players will be working hard to reward their loyalty and support by giving them senior football again next year
424106 i always maintain that at the start of every season you set out to try to win the league and our target is to get back into the premiership straight away and then our target will be trying to win it
424107 without a doubt there is another league title in me and i still have the hunger and desire to win it
424108 every time there has been an issue where a club has threatened to take the ifa to court they have always said that football matters should be sorted out on the pitch
424109 yet when it came to the new league teams had to apply and where they finished the previous season didnt matter
424110 our application was in late we hold our hands up to that but i dont think thats how the league should have been formed the top 12 teams from last season who qualified for domestic licences should have made up the new league
424111 if you look at our record over the last 20 years we have proved that we are one of the top three clubs in the country and in that time we have been the most successful club outside of belfast
424112 also because we arent a senior club we have been put out of the reserve league and that team has had to be disbanded nobody is going to tell me that is for the betterment of football
424113 we improved with every game this week at the european championships and the confidence were taking from that means the lads are on a high and if we hit the ground running i feel were ok
424114 most of the guys are level headed enough to know twenty20 cricket is a different story well have a chat at the team meeting and work out what we want to do we had a similar chat before the holland game on monday and hopefully the same thing will happen again
424115 if we play cricket like that we will scare the best teams in the world and will always win against an associate
424116 the track was very dusty this morning so we took our time starting
424117 once again the car felt good even though i encountered quite a lot of traffic during both sessions this afternoon i also got to try the revised aero package for the first time it definitely seemed to make the car better balanced which is very encouraging
424118 get them ready and get the tests done whatever the cost
424119 today we ran two more or less trouble free sessions the aero package weve developed for this race appears to have delivered the predicted results and the performance of the car is encouraging so far
424120 fridays results always have to be looked at with caution especially at a track like the hungaroring which is always very dirty on the first day
424121 clearly we are up against some very strong opposition on a track where historically we have usually struggled a bit but i am confident we can have a good race
424122 very intense when i walked into the paddock for the first time this year i thought jeez i remember how busy it was last year with all the photographers crowding around this year it seems more relaxed and the paddock seems more spacious and that feeling is better for us because we can just keep our focus on winning
424123 the players deserve this for all the hard work they have put in this week im thrilled to bits it was a bonus to get here but to win it is special
424124 they are a good side with fluency and technique but we proved we can open up good nations and score goals this week
424125 they are a good side and we had to dig in to win
424126 i saw the keeper out and thought i would have a whack at the ball its fantastic to score in the final im just pleased it went in
424127 i really got a buzz playing up front again it was a wonderful way to sign off but hopefully others will come along after me to repeat this type of result
424128 he was playing too well for me and i was sluggish at the start
424129 he was too good was serving great and i wasnt moving well but i managed to turn it around with some big serving halfway through the second set
424130 it felt like it was 100 degrees and when you are playing against someone like carlos who can make you do a lot of running you get out breath really quickly and you just have to try to make the best of it try to get some cheap points on your serve and i managed to do that in the end
424131 what ive realised is that when you finish sport theres nothing for you
424132 all of those experiences i had and the clawback from those experiences gave me the knowledge that i could always come back from something
424133 as soon as you arrive at an olympics its a really strange feeling its not the same as any other championships
424134 i remember winning that first gold like it was yesterday
424135 most people thought i had a chance of a medal in athens but no one thought i was going to get gold
424136 i remember being neck and neck with maria mutola who was the defending champion and obviously a formidable athlete
424137 the thought of going through all that again no not at all
424138 because you never know about the preparation of people where they are psychologically where they are physically what they need what they get right and wrong during the build up phase
424139 right now we have people coming along looking quite good and quite fit but that changes in the period from now to the games that period is critical it can turn someone from a bronze medal winner into a gold medallist or from a finalist to a medallist or the other way round from a medallist to someone who completely bums out
424140 ones you would have expectations of would be people like phillips idowu christine ohuruogo nicola sanders kelly sotherton
424141 and after her win the other day at crystal palace you could add marilyn okoro
424142 as an athlete you never know where your fine line is
424143 because theres a fine line between being world class and at the top of your game to being injured there isnt anything that says where that fine line is because every year you are slightly different
424144 paula is an ultimate professional more professional than i was she wouldnt be going to beijing if she didnt think she had a chance of doing pretty well shell be doing the full aqua jogging thing doing her rehab work 100 per cent so shell probably be as fit as she could be without having done as much running and maybe that will be a good thing because she is the ultimate expert in terms of getting back from injuries
424145 we all like pasta and there is always some lovely pasta
424146 its tonys favourite dish actually he loves pasta and pesto just plain and simple and olive oil thats his other passion
424147 i feel very strongly about contraception even though i know people say that as a good catholic girl i shouldnt but i disagree because i think one of the keys to womens progression in the 20th century is being able to control their fertility
424148 it comes from my mum fashion tip from cherie drink lots of water
424149 it was from next and it was all natural fibres
424150 i tell you that when carla bruni came over on a state visit
424151 and she got off that plane looking like the supermodel that she is it crossed my mind thank god im not the poor sod who is going to have to stand next to her you are on a hiding to nothing arent you
424152 a greedy self serving opportunist whose greatest betrayal is to her own sex
424153 but its what hillary clinton said to me you are not going to please all the people all the time and there are some people perhaps at one time i was that sort of person myself who out of principle might have disliked the wife of the leader of a party simply because you are not of that party
424154 you cant please people who dont really know you and you know i do think that one of the things i do want to do is please the people who matter to me and please the people that do know me
424155 with our boys when they came back with girlfriends id be on my high horse about respecting girls and treating them properly while tony would be go for it young man
424156 if i want to do politics i should get elected
424157 i wanted the kids to understand where they came from
424158 i absolutely realise i am not working class any more well part of me still is but i also know my children never will be
424159 this is the wonderful excuse the media always give isnt it they say if you write about anything then we can write about anything as a lawyer i happen to know that the law doesnt say that the law says that everyone is entitled to privacy and you are entitled to make a choice about what you share with people and what you dont which is why i didnt share what the contraceptive device was and nor am i going to
424160 it was a building site they managed to get leos and the nannys bedroom ready and our bedroom ready and the front room office ready but that was it in fact for the first two weeks the only bathroom with water in the house was my bathroom and that is on the first floor
424161 i think ill always believe that tomorrow i might not
424162 you never do know do you what is round the corner
424163 i think it is what you do with your wealth that is important i dont believe in accumulating money for moneys sake its one of the reasons i want to do more about helping women its why tony has spent a lot of his time on his faith foundation and other things like that its what you do with it that is important i think everybody is entitled to spend at least part of their income on making a nice life for themselves and their children which is what most people want
424164 that we are in our better place i am a better lawyer than tony and he was terribly uncomfortable being the candidates spouse
424165 cherie and i need to discuss the campaign so do you mind helping my wife
424166 tony ended up in the kitchen washing the dishes and as he told me later when the wife asked him tony are you interested in politics at all or are you doing this for cherie he said he wanted to get up and shoot himself
424167 but i am immensely proud of him he came in in 1997 wanting to transform britain and make it a much more tolerant society john major remember was still harking back to the 1950s with the cricket and vicar on a bicycle
424168 but tony wanted britain to be a modern multi cultural tolerant society its why we have the maternity rights we have its why we have gay civil partnerships and its fantastic the way the country has accepted that im also very proud of what he did in sierra leone bosnia afghanistan
424169 i think it is now very easy to assume that everything was fine and hunky dory and there were no consequences to doing nothing that is not what it was there were difficult choices to be made and i happen to think he made the right decision its been difficult and it hasnt always gone well but the fact that people do have the vote in iraq and the fact that some people do everything they can to undermine that shows just how important it is
424170 there have been ups and downs before this god knows we had our ups and downs
424171 its bound to be worth something on ebay that way
424172 for ebay its best to have something not personally dedicated

424207 they know that as taxpayers we support the government not the opposite
424208 human rights has become more than just a theory for the public
424209 in the past they petitioned and complained about injustice but that wasnt about defending their rights they let the higher authorities to decide their rights
424210 what they are asking for now is a change in the system and this reflects a widespread change in attitude
424211 i saw a gap between the official story and the reality which was mind blowing like the presence of the armed police
424212 so i put some of these things on the internet on my personal blog
424213 the media has made a huge step forward from the 80s
424214 would have been impossible for the public to know about in the past
424215 today even the farmers in remote areas have satellite tvs
424216 so whenever they see an election such as the one held in pakistan recently they may wonder why even though we have approximately the same economic conditions they can elect their top leaders and we cant even vote for the leader of a small county i think a consciousness of political rights has increased more than anything

424223 she has to hold her line she cant cut across the track
424224 say theres something in the track she wants to move over she cant really move over if shes committed to that line
424225 the noise doesnt bother her so if youre behind her the pressures not there
424226 i dont feel it i dont hear it so it doesnt bother me
424227 what i saw last weekend because i watched pretty close and what i saw this weekend the field should be very frightened
424228 i ran that lap and crew chief tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was and everything i said man if jimmie can beat that he can have it
424229 well he not only beat me he humiliated me by 2 tenths of a second those guys are looking pretty potent right now
424230 i think weve gone in the right direction im glad i did my job and hit my marks its a very technical track a lot like indy where its easy to miss one of the corners
424231 right now our first goal is that weve got to make the chase
424232 one thing im proud of this team for is we never want to be fat and happy with six races until the start of the chase theres a lot of time for other guys to figure things out we need to act like a top five team and run like a top five team well reflect on what we accomplished at the end of the year so lets just stay hungry
424233 its an atypical harvest weve had every weather phenomenon known to man besides hordes of locusts and raining frogs

424237 its going to be a great vintage for us but its not been easy as far as the winemaking is concerned warm weather in august got us thinking everything would be over quickly but subsequent rain and cool temperatures turned it into a vintage well suited for a more hands on approach to the fruit instead of just harvesting great grapes and letting the wine make itself it became a matter of creating the same environment in the fermenter that you saw occurring naturally earlier in the season as the season grows longer extraction becomes trickier and technical experience in the winery becomes very valuable im usually not one to say this but for us its shaping up to be a great vintage with tremendous quality across the board

424241 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
424242 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago

424248 mid cap companies possess a strategic advantage relative to firms of smaller or larger sizes offering stability as well as future growth opportunities
424249 we are extremely pleased that s amp p has recognized the emergence of well performing mid tier it firms like syntel
424250 their findings support research from leading industry analysts that highlight the strength of mid tier providers as capable alternatives to large market players we feel that syntels size stability services and culture have the company well positioned to move from the role of challenger into a leadership position

424363 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
424364 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
424365 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
424366 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
424367 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
424368 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
424369 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
424370 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
424371 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
424372 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
424373 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
424374 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
424375 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
424376 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
424377 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
424378 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
424379 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
424380 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

424386 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
424387 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

424395 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
424396 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
424397 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
424398 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
424399 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
424400 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

424403 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
424404 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
424405 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
424406 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
424407 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
424408 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
424409 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
424410 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
424411 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
424412 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
424413 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
424414 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
424415 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
424416 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
424417 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
424418 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
424419 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

424424 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
424425 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
424426 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
424427 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
424428 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
424429 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
424430 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
424431 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
424432 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
424433 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
424434 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
424435 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
424436 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
424437 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

424498 we used this portable iphone charging station with our own iphones and we really got addicted to them
424499 this is the highest capacity iphone charging station available in the marketplace today
424500 even though the latest iphone wont be available to u s customers for a few more days we thought customers should hear that we have the capability to change the battery in the brand new iphone 3g
424501 our batteries are guaranteed for 10 years whether the customer performs the replacement themselves or our technicians install the battery for you
424502 we are no longer surprised by how quickly our customers request their ipods and iphones returned to them with their new batteries
424503 we wish we could offer a kit for customers to replace their first gen ipod nano battery by themselves like we do for other ipods but the soldering involved makes this tough to do
424504 it takes a while to get familiar with the innards of the first generation ipod nano which is why folks should really send them in to us
424505 the majority of the time is spent in transit the ipod nanos do not sit around here for very long
424506 its so rewarding when we are able to keep another ipod nano out of the landfill by simply installing a new battery
424507 this shall be an everlasting statute for you to make atonement for the children of israel once in the year because of all their sins

424509 we are not the first young couple in this position we can still have a career contact with our family and say that our children are the best thing that has ever happened to us
424510 she must make certain that she doesnt fall pregnant before she starts her new job
424511 and then theres the age of the young women who are getting the abortions i dont dispute that some of them use termination as birth control this is irresponsible but i do believe there are many more who see no other way out who feel theyve made the right to decision
424512 the results of the sonar revealed that you are 4 weeks and 5 days pregnant you came in last week thursday which means that you are now 5 weeks and 3 days pregnant you can still have the medical abortion if you take the pill today you must go home and get some rest tomorrow morning you must come in for the next round of tablets after which you should get home as soon as possible because then you will experience a miscarriage you will not be able to do work for at least two days
424513 we dont have a choice but you are strong and together we will be strong i wont leave your side
424514 this is an oral tablet that you have to drink it will start causing you to have mild contractions and may even dislodge the foetus but this is a very rare occurrence you have to come back tomorrow the same time as today so that we can insert 2 tablets into your cervix and then you will go home and get into bed the bleeding will start and then it will be like you are having a miscarriage
424515 the goal of marie stopes south africa is the prevention of unwanted births and our mission is to afford women the right to have children by choice not by chance
424516 what do you mean do it again you mean that you are going to shove more tablets with that steel thing inside me again you mean that i am going to go through more cramping and more bleeding and what then no i want to keep it i shouldnt have done it what happens if i keep the baby
424517 you cant keep it because you are bleeding and the bleeding wont stop it is not really a baby anymore it is just tissue that is still there
424518 doctor it is sister yvone tshabalala from sandton clinic i have a patient here she is bleeding too much and there are big blood clots coming out the medical procedure did not work must i still put the tablets in or send her to you for it to be removed
424519 the pills used to induce early labour have a number of side effects
424520 i couldnt even lie still when the nurse shoved the tablets up inside me how am i going to do this doctor
424521 the hardest part is waking up every morning and living with the guilt pretending that this didnt happen and not being able to share the experience with anyone the hardest part is realising that i will never be the same and still having a passion for the job i thought that i would love to do when i blame the profession that i chose for influencing my decision to kill my baby
424522 we must emphasise that because of the guilt and shame involved women who suffer as a result of abortions are not only less likely to complain but they are less likely to seek medical treatment for injuries incurred
424523 so depending on the type of male or female attention one is hoping to attract the selection of bar is very important
424524 that it is important to know that when one wears a very skimpy outfit a man hoping to get lucky that night will probably target that female first
424525 if you are going for short on the bottom be sure to cover on the top and if you are going for a plunging neckline be sure to cover up on the bottom
424526 the types of drinks that a woman orders in a bar should also be taken note of
424527 gee thats a nice set of legs what time do they open
424528 he is not the kind of man any woman should be dating
424529 women are strange creatures you will find that in the group there is a pretty girl mediocre looking girl and a rotten looking girl
424530 men are shit scared of women and fear being rejected by them they would sometimes therefore go for the rotten looking girl so that they have a lower chance of being rejected
424531 from the age of ten i knew that i wanted to become a doctor
424532 i did not have a sense of being superior to black people as i had friends that were black and respected my fathers colleagues who were black
424533 but i was always aware that i was in a privileged position and though i didnt feel that apartheid was right i still benefited from it
424534 she was young and she did something that was right but it was something that came with a consequence
424535 we are not alone our personal values influence making ethical decisions and we must acknowledge our humanity at all times
424536 if you ask me whether i would do it again i would probably still have worked with the detainees but i dont think that i would do the trc again it was three years and one of the most emotionally draining experiences
424537 i left practicing as a doctor when i started working at the trc because i didnt have the time to practice and work on the commission i dont think that i will ever practice as a doctor again its not very intellectually stimulating i suppose it was helpful in training my brain in analyzing situations
424538 for evil to triumph it is necessary for good people only to do nothing
424539 you have to do work that has meaning and you must utilize your talents
424540 we fought a lot growing up and we still fight says margaret who also says that the three sisters shared a bedroom for 15 years

424544 ag no mom i think that i am light black
424545 wendy is a single mother and her son can be a handful but he is also a mad little genius
424546 she planned and executed her sister cathies wedding including making all the food
424547 wendy doesnt really do crazy if it were crazy it would be planned she did go whit water rafting once and she does travel a lot she would normally call me up and say that she has planned a trip would i like to go
424548 we called wendy immediately she met my boyfriend for the first time while she stitched his head up
424549 we are a family of strong women says margaret who also says that when the family gets together it is not a role assumed only by the girls to set the table wash the dishes or serve the food they take turns boys included
424550 a lot of men in our generation have not made that jump
424551 i know that i benefited as a white person in south africa i feel that i owe it to the country to stay
424552 i do worry about his safety because of the crime and the violence but this is a beautiful country
424553 honour your own humanity by recognizing and honouring the humanity of others regardless of colour creed gender nationality honour humanity by valuing the richness that difference creates by seeking to understand rather than to condemn and by being true to yourself

424570 live a good life if there are gods and they are just then they will not care how devout you have been but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by if there are gods but unjust then you should not want to worship them if there are no gods then you will be gone but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones
424571 to live happily is an inward power of the soul
424572 when thou art above measure angry bethink thee how momentary is mans life
424573 when you arise in the morning think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive to breathe to think to enjoy to love
424574 death hangs over thee whilst yet thou livest whilst thou mayest be good
424575 loving truth and living honestly is my attitude to life be true to yourself and be true to others thus you can be the judge of your behavior
424576 you are an intelligent human being your life is valuable for its own sake you are not second class in the universe deriving meaning and purpose from some other mind you are not inherently evil you are inherently human possessing the positive rational potential to help make this a world of morality peace and joy trust yourself
424577 believe nothing no matter where you read it or who said it no matter if i have said it unless it agrees with your own reason
424578 hatred does not cease by hatred but only by love this is the eternal rule
424579 holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else you are the one who gets burned
424580 there is no wealth like knowledge and no poverty like ignorance
424581 no one saves us but ourselves no one can and no one may
424582 those who dwell among the beauties and mysteries of the earth are never alone or weary of life
424583 we are obliged to respect defend and maintain the common bonds of union and fellowship that exist among all members of the human race
424584 the wise are instructed by reason ordinary minds by experience the stupid by necessity and brutes by instinct
424585 the first duty of a man is the seeking after and the investigation of truth
424586 until you have learned to serve men how can you serve spirits
424587 you can only protect your liberties in this world by protecting the other mans freedom you can only be free if i am free
424588 the purpose of life is living men and women should get the most they can out of their lives
424589 a republic cannot succeed till it contains a certain body of men imbued with the principles of justice and honour
424590 there is a grandeur in this view of life in which endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolved
424591 if i had to live my life again i would have made a rule to read some poetry and listen to some music at least once every week
424592 theres real poetry in the real world science is the poetry of reality
424593 we are going to die and that makes us the lucky ones most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born the potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of sahara certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than keats scientists greater than newton we know this because the set of possible people allowed by our dna so massively outnumbers the set of actual people in the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and i in our ordinariness that are here
424594 the world and the universe is an extremely beautiful place and the more we understand about it the more beautiful does it appear it is an immensely exciting experience to be born in the world born in the universe and look around you and realise that before you die you have the opportunity of understanding an immense amount about that world and about that universe and about life and about why were here we have the opportunity of understanding far far more than any of our predecessors ever that is such an exciting possibility it would be such a shame to blow it and end your life not having understood what there is to understand
424595 you could give aristotle a tutorial and you could thrill him to the core of his being aristotle was an encyclopedic polymath an all time intellect yet not only can you know more than him about the world you also can have a deeper understanding of how everything works such is the privilege of living after newton darwin einstein planck watson crick and their colleagues
424596 a mans ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy education and social ties no religious basis is necessary man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death
424597 the good or ill of man lies within his own will
424598 shall i show you the sinews of a philosopher what sinews are those a will undisappointed evils avoided powers daily exercised careful resolutions unerring decisions
424599 what is the first business of one who practices philosophy to get rid of self conceit for it is impossible for anyone to begin to learn that which he thinks he already knows
424600 try to enjoy the great festival of life with other men
424601 there is nothing to fear from the gods there is no pain in death good can be attained evil can be endured
424602 it is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and honorably and justly and it is impossible to live wisely and honorably and justly without living pleasantly
424603 life is not so short but that there is always time enough for courtesy
424604 you must realize that on the road of life there will be disappointments and that the best way to avoid another is to plan better and work harder
424605 think of all the beauty still left around you and be happy
424606 i still believe in spite of everything that people are truly good at heart i simply cant build my hopes on a foundation of confusion misery and death and yet i think this cruelty will end and that peace and tranquility will return again
424607 ive found that there is always some beauty left in nature sunshine freedom in yourself these can help you look at these things then find yourself again and then you regain your balance
424608 we need to be the change we wish to see in the world
424609 safeguarding the rights of others is the most noble and beautiful end of a human being
424610 i have learned silence from the talkative toleration from the intolerant and kindness from the unkind yet strange i am ungrateful to these teachers
424611 keep me away from the wisdom which does not cry the philosophy which does not laugh and the greatness which does not bow before children
424612 your soul is oftentimes a battlefield upon which your reason and your judgement wage war against your passion and your appetite would that i could be the peacemaker in your soul that i might turn the discord and the rivalry of your elements into oneness and melody but how shall i unless you yourselves be also the peacemakers nay the lovers all of your elements
424613 your reason and your passion are the rudder and sails of your seafaring soul if either your sails or your rudder be broken you can but toss and drift or else be held at a standstill in mid seas for reason ruling alone is a force confining and passion unattended is a flame that burns to its own destruction therefore let your soul exalt your reason to the height of passion that it may sing and let it direct your passion with reason that your passion may live through its own daily ressurection and like the phoenix rise above its own ashes
424614 one ought every day at least to hear a little song read a good poem see a fine picture and if it were possible to speak a few reasonable words
424615 sin lies only in hurting other people unnecessarily all other sins are invented nonsense
424616 do you say that religion is still needed then i answer that work study health and love constitute religion most formal religions have pronounced the love of man for woman and woman for man an evil thing they have said that sickness was sent from god now we deny it all and again proclaim that these will bring you all the good there is health work study love
424617 i do not believe in forgiveness as it is preached by the church we do not need the forgiveness of god but of each other and of ourselves
424618 while i am opposed to all orthodox creeds i have a creed myself
424619 humanity is the grand religion and no god can put a man in hell in another world who has made a little heaven in this god cannot make a man miserable if that man has made somebody else happy god cannot hate anybody who is capable of loving anybody humanity that word embraces all there is
424620 how long o how long will hu mankind worship a book how long will they grovel in the dust before the ignorant legends of the barbaric past how long o how long will they pursue phantoms in a darkness deeper than death
424621 for thousands of years people have been trying to force other people to think their way did they succeed no will they succeed no why because brute force is not an argument
424622 the closer im bound in love to you the closer i am to free
424623 above all creeds above all religions after all is that divine thing humanity
424624 love is the only bow on lifes dark cloud it is the morning and the evening star it shines upon the babe and sheds its radiance on the quiet tomb it is the mother of art inspirer of poet patriot and philosopher it is the air and light of every heart builder of every home kindler of every fire on every hearth it was the first to dream of immortality it fills the world with melody for music is the voice of love love is the magician the enchanter that changes worthless things to joy and makes royal kings and queens of common clay it is the perfume of that wondrous flower the heart and without that sacred passion that divine swoon we are less than beasts but with it earth is heaven and we are gods
424625 if abuses are destroyed man must destroy them if slaves are freed man must free them if new truths are discovered man must discover them if the naked are clothed if the hungry are fed if justice is done if labor is rewarded if superstition is driven from the mind if the defenseless are protected and if the right finally triumphs all must be the work of man the grand victories of the future must be won by man and by man alone
424626 as people become more intelligent they care less for preachers and more for teachers
424627 men often hate each other because they fear each other they fear each other because they dont know each other they dont know each other because they can not communicate they can not communicate because they are separated
424628 nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity
424629 i know that love is ultimately the only answer to mankinds problems and im going to talk about it everywhere i go i know it isnt popular to talk about it in some circles today im not talking about emotional bosh when i talk about love im talking about a strong demanding love i have seen too much hate
424630 the beginning of wisdom is the awareness that there is insufficient evidence that a god or gods have created us and the recognition that we are responsible in part for our own destiny human beings can achieve this good life but it is by the cultivation of the virtues of intelligence and courage not faith and obedience that we will most likely be able to do so
424631 as i understand it and my understanding of this is vague at best another smaller group of people stole some airplanes and crashed them into buildings and were told that they were zealots fueled by religious fervor religious fervor and if you live to be a thousand years old will that make any sense to you will that make any goddamned sense
424632 nothing is so firmly believed as that which is least known
424633 there is no passion so contagious as that of fear
424634 he who establishes his argument by noise and command shows that his reason is weak
424635 of all our infirmities the most savage is to despise our being
424636 the value of life lies not in its length but in the use we make of it
424637 strive not thou to become a god the things of mortals best befit mortality
424638 until philosophers are kings or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy and political greatness and wisdom meet in one and those commoner natures who pursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside cities will never have rest from their evils
424639 i believe in living the enjoyment of being the fulfilment of our powers the wonders of nature the marvels of the cosmos we dont have to bother ourselves too much about what lies behind it all its there we are here what is is our job is to get on with things trying to make life better as we go
424640 life was meant to be lived and curiosity must be kept alive one must never for whatever reason turn his back on life
424641 these dark days my friends will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves to our fellow men
424642 to save the world requires faith and courage faith in reason and courage to proclaim what reason shows to be true
424643 the good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge
424644 a good world needs knowledge kindliness and courage it does not need a regretful hankering after the past or a fettering of the free intelligence by the words uttered long ago by ignorant men
424645 the fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt
424646 if all our happiness is bound up entirely in our personal circumstances it is difficult not to demand of life more than it has to give
424647 as soon as we abandon our own reason and are content to rely upon authority there is no end to our troubles
424648 there lies before us if we choose continual progress in happiness knowledge and wisdom
424649 those who forget good and evil and seek only to know the facts are more likely to achieve good than those who view the world through the distorting medium of their own desires
424650 every one of us is precious in the cosmic perspective if a human disagrees with you let him live in a hundred billion galaxies you will not find another
424651 science is more than a body of knowledge it is a way of thinking it is a way of skeptically interrogating the universe with an eye for human fallibility if we are not able to ask skeptical questions to interrogate those who tell us that something is true to be skeptical of those of authority then were up for grabs for the next charlatan political or religious who comes ambling along
424652 human history can be viewed as a slowly dawning awareness that we are members of a larger group if we are to survive our loyalties must be broadened further to include the whole human community the entire planet earth
424653 what i do with my life is of my own doing i live it the best way i can
424654 im for decency period im for anything and everything that bodes love and consideration for my fellow man
424655 i would like to be remembered as a man who had a wonderful time living his life and who had good friends a fine family i dont think i could ask for anything more than that actually
424656 you gotta love livin baby cause dyins a pain in the ass
424657 i am not an athenian or a greek but a citizen of the world
424658 the unexamined life is not worth living for a human being
424659 men at some time are masters of their fates the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings
424660 and this i believe that the free exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world and this i would fight for the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes undirected and this i must fight against any religion or government which limits or destroys the individual this is what i am and what i am about i can understand why a system built on a pattern must try to destroy the free mind for it is the one thing which can by inspection destroy such a system surely i can understand this and i hate it and i will fight against it to preserve the one thing that separates us from the uncreative beasts if the glory can be killed we are lost
424661 it seems to me that if you or i must choose between two courses of thought or action we should remember our dying and try so to live that our death brings no pleasure on the world
424662 show respect to all people and grovel to none when you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living if you see no reason for giving thanks the fault lies only in yourself abuse no one and no thing for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit of its vision
424663 an early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day
424664 if you have built castles in the air your work need not be lost there is where they should be now put foundations under them
424665 go confidently in the direction of your dreams live the life youve imagined as you simplify your life the laws of the universe will be simpler
424666 only when people love one another as much as they love their gods will we have peace
424667 twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didnt do than by the ones you did do so throw off the bowlines sail away from the safe harbor catch the trade winds in your sails explore dream discover
424668 i urge you to please notice when you are happy and exclaim or murmur or think at some point
424669 i still believe that peace and plenty and happiness can be worked out some way i am a fool
424670 about belief or lack of belief in an afterlife some of you may know that i am neither christian nor jewish nor buddist nor a conventionally religious person of any sort
424671 we humanists serve as best we can the only abstraction with which we have any familarity which is our community
424672 zehn lobbyisten und manager waren aus teheran gekommen angef hrt vom pr sidenten der iranischen handelskammer mohammed nahavandian
424673 ihr deutsche m sst aufpassen dass ihr im iran gesch ft nicht den anschluss verliert
424674 sie wollten uns ihre sorge mitteilen dass deutsche firmen aus jedem rennen um auftr ge herausfallen
424675 das problem ist dass wir deutschen uns strikter daran halten als andere staaten
424676 und schlie lich zeigen sich zoll und bundesamt f r ausfuhrkontrolle sehr akribisch bei der pr fung von exporten in die islamische republik die traditionell ein enges gesch ftsverh ltnis zu den deutschen gepflegt hat und im prinzip noch viele auftr ge verspricht nicht zuletzt in der l und gasbranche
424677 deutsche firmen bef rchten iran vertr ge k nnten ihr us gesch ft gef hrden
424678 gerade im l und erdgassektor der haupteinnahmequelle des iran ist der iran besonders auf westliche technologie angewiesen und somit durch sanktionen unter druck zu setzen
424679 deutsche firmen beliefern den iran mit wichtiger technologie ohne dass dieser im atomstreit in menschenrechtsfragen der unterst tzung des internationalen terrorismus oder den drohungen gegen israel seine politik ndern muss
424680 das mffb fordert die bundesregierung deshalb auf die genehmigung umgehend zur ckzunehmen und stattdessen unilateral wirksame sanktionen gegen den iran zu verabschieden und solche sanktionen zus tzlich auf eu und un ebene voranzutreiben
424681 gesch ftsinteressen so scheint es bertrumpfen jegliche verlautbarten sorgen f r israels sicherheit
424682 die tatsache dass ausgerechnet deutschland das neben frankreich und gro britannien mitglied der europ ischen f hrungsriege eu3 ist einen standpunkt eingenommen hat der den internationalen trend hin zu einer signifikanten versch rfung der sanktionen gegen die fortsetzung des iranischen atomprogramms untergr bt ist besorgniserregend
424683 wenn ein mitglied der bundesregierung wirklich ein solch intensives aggressives und hoch sensibles gesch ft mit dem iran dem weltmeister des antisemitismus erm glicht dann ist das ein schrecklicher skandal der mich emp rt und entsetzt dass ein staatssekret r sogar ffentlich damit prahlt macht das ganze noch schlimmer
424684 wenn der iran in den besitz der atombombe k me dann h tte das verheerende folgen zuerst und vor allem f r die sicherheit und existenz israels dann f r die gesamte region und schlie lich weit dar ber hinaus f r alle in europa und der welt f r alle denen die werte freiheit demokratie und menschenw rde etwas bedeuten das muss verhindert werden dabei muss eines klar sein nicht die welt muss iran beweisen dass der iran die atombombe baut iran muss die welt berzeugen dass er die atombombe nicht will die sicherheit israels ist f r mich als deutsche bundeskanzlerin niemals verhandelbar und wenn das so ist dann d rfen das in der stunde der bew hrung keine leeren worte bleiben die bundesregierung wird sich wenn der iran nicht einlenkt weiter entschieden f r sanktionen einsetzen
424685 dass das unternehmen eine entscheidung bekam sei es negativ oder positiv

424693 members and groups made offers of extensive campaign support and endorsements for my son brad who is running for my seat they also made threats of working against brad if i voted no

424698 people will be surprised by the breadth and diversity of art practices of our regional artists
424699 they have pushed themselves to create something that will delight challenge or inform everyone who visits state street
424700 its been exciting the prospect of knowing that it will be out for thousands of people to see
424701 part of what were addressing is the cultural relevance of collecting stuff i think everybody can relate to that theme to some degree
424702 i enjoy the reaction of people who dont know im the artist
424703 on state street you can stand around and hear what people say its a very positive experience and it has opened me up to doing more public outdoor pieces
424704 i think its a unique opportunity to have large scale sculpture not just outdoors but among the public in a busy thoroughfare
424705 for many people this is a very familiar place and these works are going to help them look at it differently
424706 i applaud them for going through difficult logistical endeavor to get these works seen on a commercial street
424707 this venue is really important to art community and to the public
424708 when the sculptures go up on state street a magical transformation happens
424709 im no longer on automatic pilot as i rush down the street im transported to another place as i encounter each sculpture
424710 suspend that reaction i dont know what it means therefore i dont like it
424711 just for a moment look at each sculpture and ask yourself what the artist thinking about what they want us to think about why they chose that shape or color or materials ask others what they think create a dialogue if you take the time to do that after the sculptures come down in november you will miss them
424712 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
424713 thats such a shame especially for the ones who were clean and its most important for the athletes who were second
424714 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it
424715 when work is commissioned no matter who its named after its calling on you to do your finest work
424716 the philosophy is that theyll be more specifically matched in tone but basically its a nice gesture for the instrument maker to select the same wood
424717 having a quartet named in their honor is more enduring than even a building theres nothing else mechanical or artistic that can still be usable let alone in its prime in three or four hundred years
424718 and im known for my bullets never missing their mark especially if its the heart of a beautiful lady bang
424719 open your heart surrender it to the darkness become darkness itself
424720 we put a lot of effort into creating a safe experience for you you matter to god and you matter to us the reality is that no matter how much i want it and plan for it i cant guarantee this will be a positive experience many here are people who are hurting and hurt people hurt people we can only ask that people treat one another well and offer acceptance to one another if you care well for one another that will make it better for all of us

424747 my usual rule of thumb is any insect under an inch is safe to eat anything over an inch id usually like to cook up a little bit so it gets rid of the bitterness
424748 with worms theyre kind of mushy but if you put them over a rock on a nice sunny day they dry out and theyll actually almost be like a jerky
424749 worms are one of the highest sources of protein along with ants ants pound for pound have more than most food sources you can find
424750 if you take those and put them right up to your lips if its tingling or it has a bitter taste to it 90 per cent of the time it could be poisonous
424751 if youre in an extreme situation for survival youre better off drinking water even if it potentially might have some parasites in it
424752 less than one per cent of the people i ever send out on a canoe trip in algonquin park even see a bear so if you do see a bear first enjoy the experience bears are really fascinating creatures
424753 the most important thing is never approach a bear always back away keep in sight of the bear but always backwards never turn around and run
424754 this is not my preferred way to roll out anything
424755 but when things start leaking and then the stories say that we are hiding something which were not only not hiding but were scrambling to get out there its a bit unfair its a bit crazy
424756 frankly as rollouts go i so would have like to see this go way differently and way better

424765 heart failure patients experience high rates of hospital stays and poor outcomes
424766 by utilizing this model we can more quickly identify patients at risk for in hospital mortality who might benefit from more aggressive monitoring and intervention
424767 despite numerous advances in the treatment of chronic heart failure more work is needed to reduce the high risk of mortality for patients hospitalized for heart failure
424768 an essential next step is to study whether applying this risk prediction score will favorably impact patient care and clinical outcomes

424813 were 90 minutes away from the premier league now and that has been our gameplan all season
424814 he came here with a gameplan and an attitude to never say die i listened to everything he had to say before the game and i couldnt see a chink in the armour and then all of a sudden they get a goal
424815 we werent winning our individual battles at that stage and that concerned me
424816 it was 35 minutes on the clock before we actually went in to a challenge then the last 10 minutes of the first half were significant in the game
424817 nick barmby got the goal that settled us down and for me the second half performance was so powerful i was really proud of the players
424818 i felt the nick barmby goal allowed me to be more constructive at half time as opposed to losing the plot
424819 i feel like im putting a dampener on it when we havent done the job yet
424820 its great getting to wembley and its one of the milestones that we needed to achieve and weve achieved it
424821 but as ive said before nobody remembers a losing finalist weve got go there now with a gameplan and finish the job
424822 i thought we played very very well in the first half
424823 i thought we dominated the game and showed our intentions and scored a good goal and had chances to score more and then conceded a very very poor goal with three minutes to go until half time
424824 in the second half we were always chasing and when you are chasing you are liable to get caught on counter attacks and thats what happened
424825 as you would probably expect im quite low were a club that wins and weve gone out on the night to hull who i wish all the very best
424826 weve had a good run and when its not your time its not your time
424827 it feels unbelievable i dont think there is anyone left in hull today looking at how many supporters weve got here
424828 to score the wining goal is fantastic weve worked hard from the start of the season and weve got our rewards for that
424829 ive never been here before so get the winner is a great feeling
424830 it was a great ball from frazier campbell and i couldnt believe it went in the top corner
424831 i am lost for words its just a fantastic day
424832 its marvellous and its very fitting that dean windass got the winner
424833 it was written in the gods that it would be deano or nicky barmby the players have tried hard all season and thoroughly deserve it
424834 it is a fantastic feeling to do it here in front of all these supporters now comes the challenge but there are successes such as portsmouth and bolton and if the chairman backs me in the premier league who knows how far we can go
424835 we are having a period of grieving i told the players we were so close to being a premier league club
424836 well take three or four weeks to get over this but i want the players to come back refreshed and with a few additions to the squad well have another go next season
424837 their celebrations were a bit over the top it was as if they think theyre already at wembley for the final
424838 well well see about that football has a nasty habit of coming back to haunt you when you think youve achieved something
424839 there were some bad challenges and im not happy with the way the referee dealt with it it was as if there was a policy not to show any yellow cards
424840 one tackle by marvin elliott should have been a straight red
424841 it was horrendous but he only got booked some of my young lads will go into the return with plenty of bruises on them
424842 we know it will be a testing atmosphere at ashton gate on tuesday but maybe theyve given us some extra motivation
424843 we got to our players who were celebrating in front of our fans and pulled them away into a huddle
424844 the idea was to calm everybody down nip the celebrations in the bud and remind them theyve got to do it all over again its still only half time and palace have a very good away record we are certainly not celebrating yet
424845 he did me a favour it was a hot day and it cooled me down
424846 it was a goal that would have graced any game in the premier league
424847 i trust these players and they trust me with their fitness and commitment in the last parts of games
424848 how many times have we come back in games late on and its credit to my medical team my coaching staff and myself of course and the players for working so hard for these types of days
424849 its why you work hard all season because you need to finish strong on occasions like this
424850 we won both games 2 1 and thats put us through to a wembley final in what is one of the biggest games of the world
424851 i keep saying we have some players that have great quality
424852 trunds loves to get into that position and he does tend to tuck them in and im proud of him for doing that because he works hard at it
424853 then mcindoe always fancies himself in that kind of area and he struck it well
424854 just before the whistle went he knew there wasnt going to be much of a chance to come over and say well done to each other so credit to him
424855 everyones got to be humble in defeat and im definitely humble in victory
424856 the game can sometimes be won off the field as well as on but at the end of the day its down to your players
424857 we have to be careful as we still might be playing them next season
424858 one young yobbo caught me i think one of the security guards trod on him as he fell to the floor because i heard him squeal
424859 he needs his eyesight looking at because he was that close i dont know how he missed he just grazed me theres millions of people who would like to do that
424860 its probably one of the most successful seasons i have had when i look at the materials i have started with
424861 i have been around the dressing room tonight they have all been a revelation tonight i couldnt be any prouder
424862 the mou if required would be produced before the court by smt kokilaben mother of the ambani brothers
424863 its a private document between the ambani brothers besides broad framework of the demerger it also has the details of the division of the personal assets of ambani family
424864 its a piece of trash as far as this case in concerned
424865 its time to strengthen nato by asking more of our allies while always approaching them with the respect owed a partner
424866 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
424867 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
424868 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
424869 theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
424870 you can store 800 of your favourite songs in here and listen to them whenever you want
424871 you have no idea how many song titles start with blue
424872 we used to have a big book we had to drag around
424873 it would have been far more efficient to fly mechanics out there
424874 cnn has mixed in footage of riots that took place in budapest hungary with that of the riots in belgrade
424875 some comments on the web seem to hint that perhaps cnn were deliberately trying to make the protests seem more violent than they actually were i dont really believe that but still how does somebody accidentally edit in footage from an entirely different country and which was filmed over one year ago
424876 the force of the impact immediately flipped shias vehicle over and as a result shias left hand was crushed
424877 shia underwent four hours of surgery on sunday and has been recovering since then
424878 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
424879 we have also received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 mph and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident
424880 we have strong evidence that the other driver ran a red light
424881 he was showing obvious signs of intoxication from the smell of alcohol coming from his breath
424882 the project is in pre production stages and will go on floors later this year or early 2009 the casting is still in the initial stages and nothing has been finalised
424883 i dont want to add anything more to the speculation
424884 should we not kick those who are stopping us water
424885 hay que cambiar la mentalidad y la forma de vivir

424892 you will experience an epiphany and you will say to yourself i have to vote for barack
424893 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
424894 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics senator mccain can keep telling everyone how proud he is of these political stunts which even his republican friends and advisors have called childish but barack obama will continue talking about his plan to jumpstart our economy by giving working families 1 000 of immediate relief
424895 there is an important role for humor in political campaigns
424896 i think all of us would slit our wrists if there wasnt
424897 make sure they understand that barack obama who stands in front of tens of thousands is not anything to be intimidated by

424910 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
424911 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
424912 it was a communication to our supporters and was a kind of a bookend to a week that we thought was very successful our intention to use a little bit of humor i think campaigns can be mind numbingly boring and brutal without a little bit of humor so were proud to use a little bit of humor at the end of the week especially on a friday and the more serious point for our supporters is that despite the size of his crowds his celebrity and fans are nothing to be intimidated by as the underdog campaign as the underdog campaign sometimes the crowds arent 200 000 strong and roaring but its just a different approach and style and imagery were holding our own and were very pleased with the way things are going and where we are
424913 who are these people who hear obama say something and understand perfectly well what he means yet purposefully manipulate it to have another meaning
424914 this whole this is the biggest fairy tale i have ever seen too
424915 when american people are suffering mccain and company are making a mockery of intellect of voters he is not addressing the real issues at hand
424916 the only way mccain can win is emphasizing his own experience and showing some class
424917 barack is right mcsmallman has nothing good to say about himself hes allowed america to see his true colors and man are they ugly so instead of mcbash talking about his policies and ideas for the future of america he bashes barack day after day
424918 you wreck the coral reefs then most sea life in us waters will be non existing
424919 it was just a few weeks ago when two republican governors one of them a potential vp pick for sen john mccain r ariz were talking about americans keeping their engines tuned and tires inflated
424920 appealed to those with the real power to make change average citizens to drive slower keep engines tuned and tires properly inflated to buy hybrids and lower overall consumption
424921 ms pelosi states she had a bad experience getting drilled in 1939
424922 hesiod since were talking about idiotic statements lets talk about what obama said was part of his solution to the energy crisis he said we should make sure our tires are inflated properly he really is quite the intellectual
424923 6 million will vote against obama and insure his loss in november
424924 democrats made a huge mistake in following the lead moveon org to select obama
424925 you would think that candidate who comes along that tries to inspire hope in the election process and get new people involved in politics would be a good thing
424926 do not pay attention to political ads on tv they are full of half truths and are spun in an untrue manner
424927 how do you plan to end the war fix the economy make health care affordable to all create jobs lower my gas bill educate my children fix social security end the parisan gridlock in washington rid washington of lobbyists and corruption
424928 and since when have obambaot lefties ever cared what christians think ha
424929 so obama is like paris hilton and britney spears and then obama is like moses does that mean britney and paris are like moses as well if a b b c then a c good going mccain
424930 what is true of the negative attacks on john mccain
424931 you should dismiss anything harry reid says but john mccain does have a temper if he wants something but there is a barrier to him getting it he will goe ballistic and get very angry

424947 we can usually get the water down to a nondetectable level
424948 you can go through a simple arsenic cartridge and it depends on the amount of water and what the other constituents in the water on whether it will work

424979 in case of my election i will defend azerbaijans national interests and work to strengthen the state
424980 the majority of the party supports boycotting the elections and i support it as well
424981 unfortunately we have no basis to believe that the upcoming election will be free and fair according to international standards
424982 we have not seen any election since 1993 that was democratic they have always been falsified this year i think the situation will be even worse
424983 we believe these programs in california and florida offer the best examples of how food safety programs including mandatory trace back requirements should be implemented in every state
424984 the florida and california programs have been cited as models for the industry we believe that what we have learned over the past two years during program implementation can be used to develop responsible regulation on a nationwide basis
424985 this would not only promote food safety to protect public health but also level the playing field among all tomato producers so that we are all working under the same regulatory framework
424986 ed and i will be happy to offer any assistance and guidance we can to federal regulators and legislators who would like to learn more about our food safety and trace back programs
424987 theres a lot of attention today on global food shortages
424988 weve found a gene that is key for proper chloroplast function this finding might some day help scientists develop plants that grow better and can serve as more nutritious food
424989 we have now shown that an analogous process is required for proper chloroplast function
424990 moreover without fro7 plants sown in iron deficient soil died as young seedlings our findings are of particular interest because how iron gets into chloroplasts has not been well understood despite the significance of iron in chloroplasts
424991 enriching crops with mineral and vitamin nutrients will provide sustainable solutions to malnutrition

425010 not all people are familiar with the technology of digital printing but they are familiar with bringing their rolls of film to photo printing shops so they go there to print photos from their digital cameras or phones
425011 many people still want to keep their photos with them or have copies that they could share with friends or families
425012 most people dont want to be bothered with too much technology so theyd rather entrust their pictures to their friendly neighborhood printer

425029 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
425030 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge

425044 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
425045 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens

425051 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
425052 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
425053 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
425054 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
425055 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
425056 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
425057 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
425058 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
425059 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
425060 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
425061 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
425062 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
425063 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
425064 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
425065 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states

425067 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
425068 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
425069 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
425070 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
425071 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
425072 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
425073 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush
425074 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
425075 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
425076 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
425077 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
425078 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
425079 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
425080 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
425081 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
425082 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
425083 the main we reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
425084 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
425085 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
425086 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
425087 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
425088 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
425089 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
425090 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
425091 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
425092 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
425093 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
425094 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
425095 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
425096 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
425097 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
425098 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
425099 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
425100 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
425101 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
425102 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
425103 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
425104 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
425105 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
425106 im forced to pay for poor public schools the rub here is that
425107 im losing but big rich people are winning so thats a net social gain
425108 wal mart is in favor of raising the minimum wage
425109 average salary is at least 50 and sometimes over 100 of the federal minimum wage
425110 by these three plagues a third of mankind was killed by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which came out of their mouths
425111 but the rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the work of their hands that they should not worship demons and idols of gold silver brass stone and wood which can neither see nor hear nor walk and they did not repent
425112 listen you psycho pseudo officer get away from my dog before i 302 you into the nearest psychiatric facility dude reality check youre not a real police officer
425113 yes the dog has a rash i think its going to be ok
425114 you cant tell how skinny she is because of all this hair but shes really skinny
425115 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
425116 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
425117 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
425118 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
425119 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
425120 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
425121 nescaya allah memperbaiki bagimu amalan amalanmu dan mengampuni bagimu dosa dosamu dan barangsiapa mentaati allah dan rasul nya maka sesungguhnya ia telah mendapat kemenangan yang besar
425122 asking candidates what jacques delors had for breakfast does not really say much about their ability to do the job we will be asking them to find real life solutions to problems instead of putting them through an eu version of trivial pursuit
425123 a free computer game that lets players step into the black boots of the two teens who gunned down dozens of their fellow students at columbine high school
425124 they kind of understood more the pressures the israeli prime minister has
425125 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
425126 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
425127 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
425128 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
425129 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
425130 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
425131 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
425132 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
425133 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
425134 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
425135 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
425136 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
425137 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
425138 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
425139 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
425140 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
425141 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
425142 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
425143 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
425144 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
425145 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
425146 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
425147 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
425148 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
425149 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
425150 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
425151 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
425152 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
425153 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal

425155 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
425156 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
425157 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
425158 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
425159 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
425160 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
425161 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
425162 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
425163 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
425164 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
425165 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
425166 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
425167 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
425168 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
425169 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
425170 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
425171 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
425172 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
425173 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
425174 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
425175 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
425176 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
425177 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
425178 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
425179 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
425180 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
425181 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
425182 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
425183 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
425184 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
425185 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
425186 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
425187 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
425188 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
425189 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
425190 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
425191 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
425192 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
425193 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
425194 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
425195 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
425196 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
425197 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
425198 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
425199 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
425200 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
425201 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
425202 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
425203 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
425204 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
425205 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
425206 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
425207 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
425208 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
425209 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
425210 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
425211 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
425212 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
425213 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
425214 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
425215 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
425216 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
425217 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
425218 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
425219 dove sei cosa fai con chi sei mi pensi sei con un uomo
425220 ti penso mi manchi ti amo ti voglio bene ciao come stai
425221 tell me the truth is this love or just paris
425222 hey wait a minute i know theres no reason to fix something that isnt broke but why not think about coming up with a new kind of logic why not try to develop a whole new kind of technology that is based on a complely new kind of logic why be stuck in the bit era when we can transition into the trit era why continue using technology that is based on gates that can be either on or off when we can use three way gates that are either red green or blue
425223 there is a vitality a life force an energy a quickening that is translated through you into action and because there is only one of you in all of time this expression is unique and if you block it it will never exist through any other medium and be lost the world will not have it it is not your business to determine how good it is or how valuable or how it compares with other expressions it is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly to keep the channel open live each day from your own creative source above all else keep the channel open
425224 one of my favorite preachers albert n martin provided the answer to that question 4 years before i was born in

425227 i am not going to give you anything you must earn it
425228 first you must earn 10 000 to purchase a small portion of ownership in the company after this is accomplished you will get your next instruction
425229 it sure is tough earning money heres the 10 000 i really do want to own the business
425230 it is easy to lose or spend money that is not your own
425231 i see you really did earn the money this time
425232 children who always get what they want will want as long as they live
425233 in general the more dollars adult children receive from their parents the fewer they accumulate while those who are given fewer dollars accumulate more
425234 you are making millions a year and i am struggling to stay alive please help me
425235 if i take away your struggle i will also take away your victory
425236 there was a young boy who came across a caterpillar hanging in a cocoon he went to see the cocoon several times each day waiting for the butterfly to emerge after a few days the young boy began to see the cocoon move as a butterfly struggled to come out the boy a little impatient and wanting to help ran home and got a pair of scissors he returned and carefully cut open the cocoon and out fell a partially developed butterfly this caterpillar would never fly the young boy innocently killed the butterfly he was trying to help
425237 i remember some years ago a young man and his wife and little children moved to our arizona community as we got acquainted with them he told me of the rigorous youth he had spent as he grew up hed had to get up at five and six oclock in the morning and go out and deliver papers hed had to work on the farm and hed had to do many things that were still rankling irritation resentment in his soul then he concluded with this statement my boys are never going to have to do that and we saw his boys grow up and you couldnt get them to do anything they sluff off their church activities and nothing seemed very important to them
425238 you only painted girlies portrait i will paint my wife oyen in the nude

425243 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
425244 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
425245 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
425246 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
425247 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
425248 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
425249 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
425250 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
425251 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
425252 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
425253 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
425254 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
425255 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
425256 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
425257 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
425258 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
425259 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
425260 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
425261 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
425262 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
425263 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
425264 this large computer company is months into a new contract to replace it equipment at a major government agency but
425265 i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president
425266 its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
425267 to those who say the challenge is not politically viable i suggest they go before the american people and try to defend the status quo then bear witness to the peoples appetite for change
425268 some of our greatest accomplishments as a nation have resulted from commitments to reach a goal that fell well beyond the next election the marshall plan social security the interstate highway system
425269 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
425270 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
425271 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
425272 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
425273 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
425274 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
425275 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
425276 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
425277 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
425278 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
425279 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
425280 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
425281 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
425282 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
425283 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
425284 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
425285 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
425286 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
425287 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
425288 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
425289 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
425290 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon

425357 ever since i started on a regimen of aicar viagra and red bull coupled with the wry self deprecating humor of hugh grant in the film notting hill ive started looking like a stud and have enjoyed acting the same with a new gal every night
425358 my new studly build and hang dog look plus the energy of a thoroughbred have me in demand day and night youd think i was barack obama at a tax collectors convention im like a rock star
425359 i workout to stay in shape and drink a lot of coffee to keep going and i feel pretty bad about all the stupid stuff i have to put up with in my life i look pretty good for my age and have better than average energy but there arent any babes falling at my feet
425360 i suppose id pop a med if it was proven safe and i knew it made me healthier but theres usually a tradeoff of some kind like your metabolism speeds up and your endurance is better and then you die suddenly thats what would happen to me id finally get some hot babe in the sack and all the systems would shut down and the death rattle would commence itd be my luck i cant get anything right see ive got self depreciation down and i dont see any chicks trying to pick me up

425368 in the long run the lack of authenticity will show and the guy will expose himself for what he is if a guy is someone other than he made out to be he can get his wings clipped and other stuff pretty quickly and im not exaggerating not this time anyway i keep pruning shears in my purse damn straight

425425 i dont think theres anything wrong with doing student films low budget
425426 for instance as far as working for free in the hope of getting material
425427 thats because an actors reel is mostly used as a sales tool to convince
425428 showing an agent a lot of free work pretty much defeats that purpose
425429 so a useful reel almost always contains clips from real productions
425430 and despite what you may think casting directors are almost never excited
425431 now picture a casting director showing your student reel to spielberg or

425447 i felt like i drove the ball very well on the back nine unfortunately on the front nine i didnt really hit any fairways i didnt give myself any real birdie opportunities i did the best i could do and unfortunately i didnt perform as well as i wanted to
425448 i was thinking about shooting 59 when i was on 14
425449 i had about a 10 footer there and thought if i birdie the last five ill shoot 59 that was the worst thing to think and led to me making par there
425450 i hit a lot of fairways and a lot of greens then made a bunch of 10 footers

425488 the intention to liquidate me was more than obvious as was confirmed by the current statements of mr holbrooke who regrets that there is no death sentence here and it therefore cannot be pronounced on me although that is what he would like
425489 perhaps the usa and mr holbrooke himself did want to keep their promises becouse mr william stubner has told the media that someone called him from the state department and urged that cheif prosecutor goldstone refrain from hunting me and general mladic becouse i had sought the same status for him but mr goldstone threatened to resign if this happened
425490 it is clear that unable to fullfill the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the usa he switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic

425533 it seems that the government wishes to engineer a city in which kigali residents and delicate stomached foreigners will no longer have to suffer vulgar displays of poverty in the city centre its a loss for the city these people were a major part of the life of the city centre a much better strategy would have been for the city to have improved the property rights laws and infrastructure in poor kiyovu to promote its development shame on the city of kigali
425534 what i dont tolerate and what i believe the constitution doesnt protect is speech designed to provoke hate or violence against groups of people
425535 ill break your fingers so that youll never play guitar again and if i see anymore of these posters down ill kill you
425536 wir sollten respekt vor der entwicklung chinas haben und vor der gr e der probleme die die chinesische f hrung meistern muss in einem land mit eineinhalb milliarden menschen von denen mehrere hundert millionen noch immer unvorstellbar arm sind
425537 die chinesen scheinen einzusehen dass freiheit und menschenrechte die beste basis f r eine gute zukunft sind
425538 das ioc hat nie klar stellung bezogen und auch nicht wirklich darauf gedr ngt dass die chinesischen zusagen in bezug auf menschenrechte und pressefreiheit auch eingehalten werden
425539 es hat absolut keinen deal gegeben keine vereinbarung mit den chinesen
425540 ihr solltet wissen dass die welt im jahr 2008 gesegnet sein wird er wird sich der auserw hlte nennen
425541 ein licht wird auf die erde fallen es wird euch erleuchten sie werden eine erleuchtung haben und sie werden zu sich sagen ich muss barack w hlen
425542 vielleicht ist er der auserw hlte aber w rden sie ihm auch zutrauen unser land zu f hren
425543 es ist ungemein traurig dass an einem tag an dem 51 000 amerikaner ihre arbeit verloren haben der pr sidentschaftskandidat all seine zeit und seinen einfluss daf r nutzt sich einem anfall kindlicher streiche hinzugeben
425544 sie sagen dass ich einen komischen namen habe sie sagen dass ich nicht so aussehe wie die anderen pr sidenten auf den dollar noten
425545 its been a long time i thought we were forgotten
425546 they talk about it all the time and there was some sign of relief that the individual is no longer with us
425547 just fatigue some stress lots of stress man headaches just constant every day it just never ends
425548 physically i look good but mentally you just talk to me right now about anthrax and my whole world is itching me
425549 if its some jerk i went out on a couple of dates with i can do without that drama
425550 text messaging someone i would prefer not to see you again is really not my style
425551 but at the same time i wanted to avoid an awkward conversation
425552 were in this mode where were telling everybody everything all the time
425553 it becomes about saying things just blathering on were at the apex of that trend
425554 you pretend to be communicating when youre actually stifling communication
425555 a phone conversation is like wildfire you dont know where its going to go
425556 were slaves to our devices blackberries and phones reachable 24 7
425557 i dont want to get into hey whats going on how you doing
425558 i just get to the point like ill meet you at 3
425559 i just say i wont be coming in im under the weather by the time he hears voice mail its already noon
425560 to err is human and more than likely everyone will have some kind of embarrassing situation in their career lives to greater or lesser degree
425561 i think its so important whatever the scenario that the person immediately take some kind of action to find out what people are doing and saying and to make an effort to stop the rumour mill that might be happening
425562 at least its getting off their chest in that room rather than it festering
425563 the person whos made a poor judgment isnt the first person in the world to do this or the last
425564 it takes time to build up a reputation it takes time to pull it asunder and itll take time to build it up again but its a new day
425565 the fact that im here has helped me understand many many things
425566 i fell on this site that explained that there were mistakes
425567 this is certainly not what we set out to do
425568 we have apologized to the patients for the stress and anxiety that they have gone through and we continue to do that
425569 the share price has jumped to 142 from the 122 it was at when i was last here if you have this the value of your portfolio is up 1 800
425570 but id also like to be a goalie in the nhl
425571 id want to go to university like ken dryden so that when i retire from hockey at the age of 37 i could go to another job
425572 whatever you choose you have to choose well because youll do it for a long time
425573 too many choices can be as bad as not enough
425574 its unsettling to have too few choices because its hard to find where you fit in but if you have too many choices its the same dilemma where do you throw yourself
425575 it was an introduction to what they can become in life
425576 and theyre so proud of their parents who talk about the pros and cons of their work
425577 the last generation of parents were less career savvy than this one
425578 thirty years ago work was a 40 hour a week thing and not the 80 hour marathon it is now and people were unlikely to question their career choices now we have heightened career consciousness
425579 in the same way we expose children to art and theatre
425580 giving them a better idea of what people do for a living is like getting them to listen to mozart or bach it enhances their lives
425581 the actual career eureka doesnt happen until theyre in their early 30s
425582 sure some kids know at an early age that theyre interested in the theatre or words or painting or hairdressing but most dont begin to reflect on what they like or dont like until theyve had jobs i call it successive approximations they can narrow it down by the time they get to university
425583 youll pursue an educational course but it can be a tree that has several branches
425584 the person who studies social work because she wants to help people may discover she cant bear being on the front lines handling peoples problems and would rather go into policy work
425585 young adults often dont understand what they want because they dont have enough information
425586 they need to look at the big picture of who they are they may have an interest in something but the career may not mesh with who they are as a complete person
425587 one of the kids said i dont want to do this its too computerized for me he hadnt realized what it was really like
425588 kids can develop a concept of what they like but thatll change a huge amount
425589 parents should not evaluate every one of their kids missteps as a harbinger of disaster or every one of their talents as bellwethers of future career success
425590 i want to be a professional swimmer an archeologist a musician a writer and an artist
425591 i used to want to be about 20 different things but im down to five now its hard to choose
425592 was i disappointed by his attitude not at all i found him to be very serious and focused
425593 he wanted to leave chelsea i am certain of that although it created a lot of anxiety for him and in fact he remained because of family matters
425594 he stayed for his father who he is extremely close to and for his whole environment therefore he was unable to create that split that they expected and we were hoping for
425595 inter coach jose mourinho did hope for this move but we knew it was going to be difficult
425596 over 60 percent of women believe their biggest health threat is breast cancer but heart disease kills six times as many women as breast cancer
425597 some risk factors are different for women than for men
425598 heart attacks often strike without warning if a woman does not realize heart disease is a health threat she will not make heart healthy changes or respond to symptoms once they occur
425599 i never had chest pains but i had pain in my back and fleeting tightness in my jaw
425600 i just felt weird at work someone told me i looked pale
425601 i wasnt in any pain but it hurt to lie on either side
425602 i thought i had pulled a muscle in my back
425603 after the surgery i felt better immediately even in the icu
425604 having a heart attack does wake you up a bit for a while
425605 not every woman who has heart disease will undergo an attack which occurs when the heart is deprived of blood and oxygen usually from a blockage in the artery
425606 but women who do suffer one are more likely than men to die of it in part because women dont always have easily recognizable chest grabbing arm clutching symptoms female heart attack victims describe generalized discomfort in the chest breast back shoulders neck or throat
425607 shortness of breath anxiety and nausea were other common symptoms in subjects
425608 think ill become a junkie and live on the streets
425609 hey ill rock my boots today its been a while and theyre good for stability with all the foot and legwork wiring entails then out the door a tad earlier than usual

425611 i was kind of under the impression that you were into me
425612 im im very attracted to you but i dont want to break up with my boyfriend im sorry if i led you on
425613 and from that reaction clearly you want me too and while i would definitely want to date you if you cant do that ill take whatever you want to give me
425614 i dont think ive ever been with a woman who was quite so into sex
425615 youre pretty spectacular yourself ive never been with a guy who made me cum from intercourse before
425616 its just something ive always wanted to try i dont know why but it just seems so hot to me
425617 i i have had anal sex and from my perspective it was amazing but most women dont enjoy it are you sure you want to do this
425618 itll be best if you get on your hands and knees
425619 insist para evitar esto que el juego fuese lanzado a trav s de distribuci n digital pero capcom jap n no lo acept
425620 only certain two trucks are allowed on the turnpike aaa cant help me here i have to get off the turnpike

425622 im sorry but on our map that is still the new jersey turnpike we cant get you there but you have aaa plus it will pay for the turnpike authority to come and get you thats okay they are faster than we are
425623 maybe its wishful thinking and the car is completely broken but i think it just needs gas
425624 and as a bonus i get to ride in a big truck
425625 theres a gas station open back in bayonne at exit 14a
425626 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognise that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
425627 until someone does it without going undefeated we have to plan accordingly
425628 it will be about not getting complacent because we barely pulled some wins out last year
425629 i just didnt put in enough measures to overcome those little things against the types of opponents we see early
425630 my hope is experience as both player and coach pulls us through
425631 its not bcs or bust but it is certainly one of our programs goals
425632 right now no one knows who they are and i think they are eager for their chance
425633 how soon they will play to their ability and do whats necessary for us to win games i dont know
425634 when i am in the backfield and ive got harvey to my left and fui to my right i feel pretty good about it
425635 i cant tell you for sure how byu will replace tonga other than i think we have enough players to sort it out
425636 our forces have arrested 265 suspects so far during our operations in diyala
425637 the operation is still on going successfully and is now in its fifth day
425638 although tournament officials were prepared to tranquilize the animal and stop play were it to become aggressive or spooked after several minutes the bear crawled through a drainage pipe on the ninth hole that leads to the west course then went through another drainage pipe and into the wilderness leaving unnerved galleries and golfers behind
425639 his unique perspective on global political issues and emerging trends
425640 the panel has determined that your dishonest conduct and plagiarising other peoples work on multiple occasions represents a serious breach of the principles that are central to good medical practice the panel is in no doubt that this amounts to misconduct which is serious
425641 your dishonest conduct brings the profession into disrepute and the panel has concluded that your fitness to practise is impaired by reason of your misconduct
425642 its because of mad cow disease we cant risk you
425643 of course i understand there are enormous numbers of cattle wandering around central london where i live its highly dangerous unlike india where their cows are holy
425644 will that tell me if i have mad cow disease
425645 owing to unattributed use of text from other published sources
425646 the articles we say speak for themselves and they all demonstrate the extent dr persaud has appropriated the work of others as his own

425679 were hopefully intelligent human beings who can talk about discuss and maybe even achieve much greater things than learning about who youre shagging

425688 there is a growing confidence among officers diplomats and politicians that a constitutional iraq is going to make it we dont hear much anymore of trisecting the country much less pulling all american troops out in defeat
425689 the 2007 surge the anbar awakening of tribal sheiks against al qaida the change to counterinsurgency tactics the vast increase in the size and competence of the iraqi security forces the sheer number of enemy jihadists killed between 2003 8 the unexpected political savvy of prime minister nouri al maliki and the magnetic leadership of gen david petraeus have all contributed to a radically improved iraq pundits and politicians especially presumptive democratic presidential nominee barack obama are readjusting their positions to reflect the new undeniable realities on the ground in iraq
425690 none of this means that a secure future for iraq is certain
425691 the freedom the iraqi people are starting to enjoy is the most wonderful thing america can do for citizens of this world
425692 god bless the fine men and women in our armed forces that have liberated an oppressed people operation iraqi freedom always was a just and noble cause and now were winning

425704 a large number of children and women are reported missing every year in india about 1 34 000 women are reported missing in india between 1996 and 2001 trafficking has acquired grave dimensions with penetration of organised crime syndicates
425705 human trafficking has become major money making business next to arms and drug trafficking illiteracy coupled with poverty is the main reason making women and children fall prey to trafficking
425706 we have appointed nodal officers in all the districts to monitor the trafficking only through sensitising the society we can bring an end to this menace

425713 ik heb veel mensen gesproken en ze vertelden me dat ajax in de jaren zeventig met een extreem jonge ploeg en een nieuwe spelopvatting de europa cup won aldus fabregas

425733 previous research had shown that fast music can cause fast drinking and that music versus no music can cause a person to spend more time in a bar this is the first time that an experimental approach in a real context found the effects of loud music on alcohol consumption we have shown that environmental music played in a bar is associated with an increase in drinking we need to encourage bar owners to play music at a more moderate level and make consumers aware that loud music can influence their alcohol consumption
425734 your fans are the ones who support your movies without them your career is over im turning 20 this year so of course im going to have to grow up but ill do it when the time is right
425735 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
425736 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
425737 every decent man is ashamed of the government he lives under
425738 wal mart stores inc is mobilizing its store managers and department supervisors around the country to warn that if democrats win power in november theyll likely change federal law to make it easier for workers to unionize companies including wal mart in recent weeks thousands of wal mart store managers and department heads have been summoned to mandatory meetings at which the retailer stresses the downside for workers if stores were to be unionized according to about a dozen wal mart employees who attended such meetings in seven states wal mart executives claim that employees at unionized stores would have to pay hefty union dues while getting nothing in return and may have to go on strike without compensation also unionization could mean fewer jobs as labor costs rise
425739 not that were telling you to do as we say
425740 when you have many young players you cannot keep them all
425741 the most important thing is that you develop them as a player and they have a big career
425742 at some stage you have to consider the quality of the player and what is in front of him
425743 at the time the players in front of bentley like ljungberg and pires were better than him
425744 he wanted to play more central in the dennis bergkamp role and i felt at the time he was not ready he would be more ready today
425745 there comes a moment when a player has to play to develop when you feel that you have to make a decision to let him go or keep him
425746 the fact that bentley is now a national team player proves it was the right decision
425747 we deserve praise because we were not stupid and keep the player in the reserves
425748 at youth level you are working 90 for other clubs some players who are just a little bit short for you go somewhere else but you have an influence on their development
425749 when you have an academy of our quality not every player can make it

425752 our survival as a people came through those black organisations we are here to re establish and renew those ties that bind us together
425753 therefore we must show solidarity in emancipation our mission is to unite africans all over the world like what george padmore and martin luther king started before and hold a strong position for pan africanism
425754 since my arrival in trinidad and tobago ive seen people i feel i met somewhere before same face same music and the warmth of your hospitality there is no time to lose this brotherhood
425755 there are new frontiers to cross and set in this paradigm of globalisation all must work together to truly become emancipated the world is moving in a direction which requires leadership by vision transcending tribal national and even continental bounds
425756 when african people elect a government to conduct their affairs they expect that their government take care of them
425757 the main river to cross is not physical anymore we are not free because we are not mentally over it
425758 when he noons pelt that bottle the gunmen start to open shots on everybody
425759 the way he charles get shoot it look like the killer get pay to do that
425760 this is real stupidness going on in trinidad and tobago you know karen was drinking and liming and just get shoot innocent
425761 it is a working document its nobodys proposals not the government of trinidad and tobago not the round table i dont want anyone to say it is manning proposing
425762 the prime minister will be producing something in another two months or so nothing will emerge as a consensus document on our the round table members part
425763 i dont know how he will do it but he has promised to do something and he has to produce something i assume that what he produces will be a working paper and people will have the opportunity to work with that
425764 i know that the draftsman is working on the document and that it wont look like the document the prime minister unveiled everything is changing week after week i do hope that we are relieved of this soon
425765 everybody keeps speaking and we try to put a view some members are pretty outspoken
425766 everything is being changed all the time it will be a year or two before anything is taken seriously much less become law and there will be many changes as a result of discussions and consultations
425767 quite frankly i dont see how a body like the jlsc can be made more accountable it is at the heart of the judiciary it makes appointments i dont see its secrecy as a problem for example with regard to appointments how can a commission reveal questions of personalities their characters and their suitability to go to the court of appeal its very sensitive
425768 there is a pervasive obsession on the part of politicians and their inherent dislike of independent bodies politicians have a predisposition of removing all constitutional restraints on their powers
425769 why they cannot spend that same money so that the staff could provide quality and effective service
425770 but what are those long sticks coming out of the top of the bag daddy
425771 its a bonus for anyone like me who didnt know what to do with coins and didnt throw them away
425772 everyone is totally confused maybe things will settle down in a few days its farcical at the moment
425773 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1 percent
425774 you can put things in place to prevent people from getting inside a company
425775 but how do you deal with that little logger device or some sort of device that captures important information from inside the organization
425776 it intercepts the keystrokes records them and then just passes them on to the computer
425777 its really interesting that companies are spending an inordinate amount of money trying to protect information but theyre trying to protect it from people outside the organization
425778 i think thats appropriate because there are a lot of bad guys out there but a recent study showed 80 percent of data leakage problems actually came from within i think companies are going to have to start paying attention to sensitive data within the organization getting out i think thats a huge problem
425779 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
425780 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
425781 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
425782 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
425783 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
425784 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
425785 it gives you what the government wants you to know
425786 athletes who make the unacceptable choice to cheat should recognize that there will be consequences those consequences can be severe including the loss of medals and results were in full support of this action in other matters like this in the past weve worked with the ioc to make certain medals will be returned and well do so again
425787 thats such a shame especially for the ones who were clean and its most important for the athletes who were second
425788 you lose that opportunity to stand on top of the podium and feel the joy of winning the race those are the people who hurt the worst when there are cheaters ahead of them giving back the medals is just a technicality because you cant repair the hurt feelings and the hard work that went into it
425789 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
425790 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue

425805 im not trying to over push it or make matters worse
425806 i dont think we would have taken him back if we thought we had to keep an eye on him

425820 a good day to start obviously because it gives you a good feel where your team is
425821 i was pleased with the first day of practice i would like to be upset about some things and i am sure after watching film i will see places to improve but i like the teams demeanor and the way they came to practice
425822 the relatively stable level of venture investment this quarter across a broad swath of industries and all stages of development evidences that there are no shortages of opportunities for innovative companies

425824 if i have a chance to put three or four more players into the game i will
425825 if not i will follow my idea for the game against portsmouth
425826 im not thinking about giving shevchenko a game if i need to put him or franco di santo in the game i will but my idea is about portsmouth i know 75 of my team now maybe 85
425827 great we didnt know where you were by the way

425845 the left parties had never shied away from raising peoples issues even when they were supporting the upa government at the centre and it would continue to do so even if it meant opposing the bsp government over issues relating to the farmers labourers and others
425846 when we gave the mice a small amount of daily exercise in the presence or not of the drug all showed an increased ability to run but those on the drug gained an additional hour
425847 its tricking the muscle into believing its been exercised daily
425848 its basically the couch potato experiment and it proves you can have a pharmacologic equivalent to exercise
425849 the drug by itself had no impact on running ability
425850 we were blown away that aicar alone mimicked exercise not to the same level but a healthy boost
425851 in this study we revealed that synthetic ppard activation and exercise or more importantly ampk activation alone provides a robust transcriptional cue that re programs the skeletal muscle genome and dramatically enhances endurance
425852 we believe that the strategy of re organizing the preset genetic imprint of muscle as well as other tissues using exercise mimetic drugs has therapeutic potential in treating certain muscle diseases such as wasting and frailty as well as obesity where exercise is known to be beneficial

425856 gay boys still have little permission to be feminine while gay girls now have much more permission to be masculine perhaps as a result gay teenage boys commit suicide three times more often than gay teenage girls
425857 if men have the power why do they commit suicide more
425858 husbands whose wives die commit suicide ten times more often than wives whose husbands die

425888 the other side has to accept that the solution will be reached by establishing a new partnership between two equal peoples and to give up trying to find new interlocutors and divert attention
425889 everybody should now understand that the efforts of south cyprus to take the turkish cypriot people under their domination and to expand their sovereignty over the north of the island are in vain

425911 neither does the 123 agreement with the us provide any such fuel supply guarantee nor can the iaea ensure uninterrupted fuel supply since it is a monitoring agency
425912 thus the provisions of the hyde act and not the assurances made by the indian prime minister in parliament are shaping the course of the indo us nuclear deal through the various stages
425913 therefore the safeguards agreement can only be terminated under the standard termination conditions contained in articles 29 and 32 of the agreement implying that nuclear facilities can be withdrawn from safeguards only after these facilities are no longer usable for any nuclear activity
425914 as with other safeguards agreements between the agency and member states the indian agreement is of indefinite duration
425915 there are no conditions for the discontinuation of safeguards other than those provided by the safeguards agreement itself the termination provisions contained in the agreement are the same as for other 66 type agreements

425923 some drugs methamphetamine are so damaging that after a few tries the user is no longer sane
425924 decriminalizing drugs would have the effect of lowering their cost to users the cash price would go down and people would no longer see the risk of jail as a cost as a result usage goes up
425925 most of the drug related crime comes from the cost of supporting the habit if prices go down so will the crimes related to drug abuse
425926 1 many people would infer from decriminalization that drugs are not bad or are at least not as bad as they thought
425927 im curious what part of my statement you consider to be incorrect is it that decriminalization would lower costs or that drugs work on the same economic principles that govern every other product
425928 to the extent that the drug war has increased the price of drugs to the user which it certainly has and thus reduced the amount used it has been a success
425929 the only way to decrease supply is to decrease demand
425930 you want to decrease demand easy shoot drug users on sight
425931 you want to decrease demand easy shoot drug users on sight
425932 the fact that the drug prohibition increases the costs to users naturally brings about cheaper and in this case more dangerous substitutes
425933 the cost to society is definitely greater having to pay for someone who probably at minimum provided some net productivity to society now is a total drain on the system

426075 i dont know what is the rationale behind his decision to rest the key players from the match it was a crucial match and he should have started with the first eleven
426076 had we lost the match we would have been in a precarious situation to qualify for the semi finals
426077 you first secure your semi final place and then think of giving chance to the bench players that is the way i look at it
426078 he is the key man upfront without him indian forward line is toothless
426079 i dont want to be too critical of what houghton is doing at this stage of the tournament but obviously in such a crucial match he should have fielded the best players
426080 obviously a win against tajikistan would have ensured a semifinal place and i think houghton should have fielded the first eleven and go for the lead and see later in the match that the key players could be substituted out
426081 he would have the chance to rest the key players and tried the bench after winning against tajikistan
426082 india are playing at home and they were in fine fettle just before the tournament having toured portugal for a training cum competition so i fancy our chances against turkmenistan and even go on to win the tournament

426117 we wont qualify anyway so lets hope we get a big team to play against so we can cash in on the home game
426118 todays public comments by manchester uniteds manager announcing that he has made an offer for dimitar and is confident that the deal will go through with time working in their favour is a blatant example of sheer arrogance and interference with one of our players
426119 it is also probably one of the worst offences by any manager in the premier league to date and is unbelievably hypocritical given his recent comments in respect of cristiano ronaldo and real madrid
426120 as a result we have today made an official complaint to the pl about the conduct of manchester united
426121 we told both clubs very early on that we had no interest in selling robbie or dimitar respectively and that they should refrain from pursuing the player both clubs arrogantly chose to ignore this request and we now have evidence that both clubs have systematically been working to prise the players away from us outside of pl rules of conduct
426122 it is hypocrisy personified that spurs are complaining about things they themselves have done
426123 they took away our coach tottenhams style is demonstrated by the way they contacted juande ramos
426124 they made an excellent dizzying offer but im under contract to sevilla and my decision is to fulfil it
426125 there was not the slightest possibility that i would accept it because im under contract it did not interest me or the club i havent spoken to the club sevilla because there was no possibility of me accepting it
426126 and there is martina who is my cousin and susy my girlfriend and her husband and there is luigi who is so funny and my sister the other sister is married and i never see her although she lives right here in bridge and sometimes there is giovanna only when we go dancing and my boyfriend hes rarely there and theres a lot of people we meet when we go to tuna like the girl that works at the butcher here at the supermarket you know and that guy we saw at the parking lot and lots of folks from plaisance as well
426127 hows sex around here ely is it easy to have some

426164 the five year contract creates an additional paid holiday iidal fitil a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
426165 the new contract includes eight paid holidays which is the same number provided in the old contract
426166 however the union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
426167 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production

426187 b is a base level of fame that we identified and quantified by analysing the average level of fame in the year before peak
426188 for george clooney b would be a large number but for a fabulous nobody like a new big brother contestant b is zero p is the increment of fame above the base level
426189 this formula fits the data remarkably well giving a precise numerical value to the 15 month theory if i put in t 5 corresponding to 15 months after the peak it gives f b p 1 50 1 50 which works out at f b 04p in other words up to 96 of the fame boost achieved at the peak of public attention has been frittered away
426190 putting t 0 into the equation gives an infinite fame peak not mathematically accurate perhaps but the concept of the level of fame being off the radar is apposite
426191 the most recent improvement of the traffic quality is achieved by implementing new fraud prevention tools the high efficiency of newly implemented fraud prevention tools will allow us to efficiently prevent almost all kinds of today known click frauds with the help of it we will be able to provide only the most targeted and high quality traffic to our valuable advertisers
426192 all advertisers in 3fn marketing will feel the considerable improvement of the traffic quality after the implementation of new fraud prevention tools of course that is a great news moreover we are convinced that it will not only make traffic more qualitative and targeted but as the result it will increase roi of all pay per click campaigns the implementations of very powerful and efficient fraud prevention tools is a significant improvement to traffic quality and will protect advertisers from all frauds and tricks that can be possible in pay per click advertising

426202 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
426203 roy w spencer is a principal research scientist for university of alabama in huntsville in the past he served as senior scientist for climate studies at nasas marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama spencer is a recipient of nasas medal for exceptional scientific achievement
426204 with very few exceptions we climate scientists are funded by the federal government
426205 the epa deserves special mention when it comes to the politics of climate change i remind you that government agencies have two central goals the first is to forever perpetuate their own existence once these agencies are created it seems they can never be destroyed the second goal of a government agency is to spend as much of your money as they can get their hands on
426206 i have come to the conclusion that politicians who advocate such solutions are either incapable of critical thought or have underlying political or financial motives it almost seems like they want to pander to public sentiment spread socialism or destroy our modern way of life maybe all three

426272 hiv and aids remains a critical issue for glbt people as the epidemic continues to affect our community disproportionately particularly young people and gay and bisexual men of color
426273 we ask that the platform include a call for the development and implementation of a comprehensive national strategy on hiv aids
426274 despite advances far too many glbt americans continue to face workplace discrimination it remains legal to fire someone based solely on sexual orientation in 30 states and in 38 states based on gender identity
426275 transgender people are particularly vulnerable to discrimination in the workplace and it is absolutely crucial that the platform explicitly support workplace protections based on gender identity we ask that the platform call for the adoption of a federal law that prohibits employment discrimination against all members of our community
426276 while marriage and other forms of relationship recognition are a reality for gay and lesbian couples in more and more states federal law continues to deny them access to a myriad of rights and benefits for example these committed couples do not have equal access to social security survivor benefits equitable taxation of their health insurance benefits or the ability to attain permanent legal status for a foreign partner we ask that the platform continue to support equal rights benefits and responsibilities for gay and lesbian couples
426277 while we have worked with national partners to provide testimony to the platform committee we have more importantly encouraged thousands of stonewall democrats across our country to provide similar testimony on behalf of pro equality positions
426278 stonewall democrats is continuing to work with the platform committee national convention delegates and party leaders to ensure that issues important to the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community are advocated within the democratic party

426325 i am delighted to be taking part in climate camp this year and where better to highlight the governments failure to provide leadership on climate change than kingsnorth the proposed location for the first coal fired power station in britain for 30 years
426326 a new coal facility at kingsnorth would emit up to 8 million tonnes of co2 into the atmosphere each year and potentially keep doing so for 50 years that annual emissions figure is as much c02 as the worlds 24 lowest emitting countries combined
426327 despite all its climate rhetoric greenhouse gas emissions have risen under this labour adminstration any government which commits to more coal fired power stations and kingsnorth is only the start then claims to be aiming for a massive reduction in carbon emissions by 2020 is quite simply living in a fantasy land
426328 our political leaders seem unable to grasp a more radical social and environmental agenda they can no longer commit to endless free market economic growth which has played a huge part in the rapid generation of damaging climate emissions and then wring their hands about climate change
426329 the government should be showing real leadership in this debate with measures to tackle rising energy costs and fuel poverty as well as initiating major investment in energy efficiency renewables and decentralised energy

426335 he had an appointment we take people with appointments first
426336 i am really really angry at you you f a
426337 im the stress doc this is stressful deal with it
426338 if i am being absolutely honest i hope the snp would win rather than labour if we are honest we are fighting for third place
426339 were not going to win the election we want to take third but if you put me on the spot and say who would you rather win i would rather gordon brown got a political kicking
426340 solidarity will continue to welcome positive reforms from the snp and say why and when we dont think they go far enough we will criticise the snp when they put the interest of business and the wealthy before the interests of the majority of society and we will point out consistently that it is the left leaning measures of the snp that have so far also proved the most popular
426341 the snp is now the party of protest snp is to the left of labour so is glasgow east
426342 highlighted bad social conditions in glasgow the same conditions hold in london liverpool sheffield newcastle and hartlepool a unified struggle by working class in britain against poverty inequality the consequences of war in iraq the attack on democratic rights and all the policies of the social elite for whom labour and the tories speak is needed in what sense does your proposal of scottish independence advance this
426343 has recently expanded to incorporate 10 new nations with a lower population than scotland scotland has the economic strength to survive
426344 i dont feel british or part of british imperialism labour is a british party
426345 this is a historic victory in glasgow east for the snp and i congratulate john mason let us be clear it is a victory for a left of centre party which carries on glasgows radical tradition
426346 there was not widespread overt explicit talk on the streets of this being a vote on independence
426347 it clearly is a clash of contrasting opinions on the westminster labour government compared to the holyrood snp government and is a massive impetus towards independence
426348 i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure
426349 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today

426354 if any evidence were to be presented against any individual in pakistan or against the interest of pakistans neighbors then the government would certainly act on that evidence
426355 several outstanding problems in the relationship between the united states and pakistan that the elected government inherited from the past are currently being resolved
426356 these include issues of trust between our two intelligence services
426357 if you ask me to describe the state of the dialogue it is in a place where it hasnt been in the last four years
426358 we face a situation where things have happened in the recent past which were unfortunate and which quite frankly have affected the future of the dialogue
426359 if you have this fluid situation you have elements within the army within the isi who have the opportunity to move forward with their own agenda with respect to afghanistan and india
426360 there is no direction this is what has opened up the door to these elements
426361 how can you keep up with her this woman who is always reading another book besides the one before her eyes a book that does not yet exist but which since she wants it cannot fail to exist
426362 she taught me how to love she was always talking about these crazy things and i never understood a word she said all i understood was that she was the girl i sat up every night thinking about
426363 i feel that based on all the attention the hcu was getting people thought i had political threat
426364 also your educational and research institutions and music particularly how through calypso you educate people
426365 since my arrival everywhere i look i saw people i had met somewhere before your people make me and my delegation feel very much at home
426366 there is no time to lose as we strive to cross new frontiers
426367 we have to strengthen our cooperation and resource development in agriculture education tourism and the environment
426368 let us resolve to make what was once our tragedy into a force for development
426369 as our countries put our voices together in order to be heard we must also strengthen our cooperation in resource development especially in education science and technology
426370 when african people elect a black government to do their affairs they should
426371 deal with all the problems of all trinbagonians but do not forget the africans he said the country is at a time when young men in the ghetto are choosing their coffins as maximus dan describes in one of his songs
426372 it seems to me as we look around the state of black trinidad and tobago is not as healthy as it ought to be even the government has acknowledged black youth is in crisis i suggest that the legacy of slavery has left deep scars
426373 we should see bits of sunshine throughout the morning followed by mid morning showers

426376 getting him here excites me and shows the kind of football im looking to play at blackburn
426377 im extremely disappointed that having returned to training i now have to undergo further surgery
426378 however im confident that i can recover from this setback sooner rather than later
426379 this shows that not even that hellish trauma of the middle passage or the leg or neck irons that were put on our ancestors could break the spirits of africa
426380 we are a small country with small resources but a big heart and i wish to share the blessings that almighty god has given us with my african brothers and sisters i come with even a bigger heart for africa what i am saying is that it may be possible for all of us globally to sit together in a forum such as the african union and solve some of our problems together given our countrys technological achievements in the energy sector the government of trinidad and tobago has taken the decision to make our expertise in the sector available free of charge to a number of west african countries the countries involved are chad nigeria cameroon equatorial guinea gabon the republic of congo and angola in this regard trinidad and tobago is punching above its weight in the international community we see this as trinidad and tobagos contribution to africas achievement of the united nations millennium goals

426383 a very sensitive aspect of this relates to the specific institutional accountability of the judiciary as a body in receipt of public money
426384 by far the most generous tax and profit sharing provisions in the region
426385 this is a very humbling experience for me because back home in africa much as we live on the continent we are not celebrating our blackness we are not celebrating them as special we are not relating with our ancestors and all those who were inhumanly treated
426386 i dont think ive ever been to something this big in terms of an emancipation event
426387 i have to emancipate myself therefore i have to be independent all the way
426388 emancipation means freedom and of all people black white all different colours come together and talk interact and to make society better than it is
426389 we are not sure what they are going to do because she did not specify but she spoke about needing a special majority which sounds like they intend to take away peoples fundamental rights
426390 we are not sure whether it is teachers who take their 14 days annual sick leave and their 14 days occasional leave which was granted under the education act more than 40 years ago or it referred to those teachers who take more days than they are entitled
426391 the ministry has been too inefficient ineffective and too slow in dealing with these teachers

426401 schools medical facilities return of all the artifacts removed from african and caribbean territories and taken to europe and other countries setting up of an african museum and the inclusion of african history and culture in the school curriculum from primary to secondary
426402 as far as tertiary education is concerned some aspects of african history are taught at university all that will be needed is to expand the studies
426403 but we are still waiting on some legal advice before we make the formal move
426404 mohlabani died but we intend to keep the struggle alive
426405 it did not mean paying large sums of money to the relatives of the slaves it meant the provision of goods services and monuments to the african community
426406 we also have to take into consideration the return of looted treasures and artifacts and the establishment of a development fund for use in the caribbean
426407 while some african and caribbean leaders argue that a simple sorry from the perpetrators of such crimes would be enough to wipe away 500 years of servitude others reject the idea of financial compensation arguing that no amount of money however large could settle the score
426408 what we need is tangible contributions that we can touch and feel such as schools museums the development of art and culture
426409 there is no limit or statute that debarred the reopening of discussions on the crimes that were committed on humanity
426410 all that is necessary was the setting up of a committee by government to look at the issue and to have the constitution changed to accommodate the idea of historic crimes
426411 reparation is not only a matter of faith in which god alone is the ultimate judge it is one in which the powers that be should exercise a political legal and constitutional and moral manifestation of the thorny issue
426412 the issue of reparation is not new people like miriam makeba and mrs nelson mandela had championed this in many countries it worked in europe and the far east and there is no reason why it cannot work in the caribbean
426413 the government is now considering that all graduates all citizens of trinidad and tobago who graduate from any recognised institution of learning with first class honours will be guaranteed government funding to the phd level

426428 its hard to accept a belated apology for an institution that humiliated and worked my people to the bone
426429 im just not convinced that a federal apology has any weight
426430 yeah im closer to deciding what else do youve got theres got to be something we could talk about that is better than that
426431 ive worked with manion for six years and he was the only guy i worked with
426432 its definitely been different weve been in communication with manion as much as possible between practices and stuff obviously hes the one in charge of getting the car prepared during the week
426433 hes in charge of the setup thats in it when we unload and today we unloaded really good so hes doing a good job its definitely different greci hasnt worked on these cars much
426434 hes doing a good job with the guys keeping things organized
426435 thats kind of why we picked him because the guys know him and they get along well and they have a lot of respect for him hes been able to keep the troops rallied and keep things going smoothly
426436 what i saw last weekend because i watched pretty close and what i saw this weekend the field should be very frightened
426437 i ran that lap and crew chief tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was and everything i said man if jimmie can beat that he can have it
426438 well he not only beat me he humiliated me by 2 tenths of a second those guys are looking pretty potent right now
426439 i think weve gone in the right direction there has been a lot of hard work throughout all of hendrick motorsports and its nice to see it coming together im glad i did my job and hit my marks its a very technical track a lot like indy where its easy to miss one of the corners
426440 right now our first goal is that weve got to make the chase
426441 one thing im proud of this team for is we never want to be fat and happy with six races until the start of the chase theres a lot of time for other guys to figure things out we need to act like a top five team and run like a top five team well reflect on what we accomplished at the end of the year so lets just stay hungry
426442 dont forget just as 48 has risen theres someone else whos going to rise before chase time
426443 n o sei de nada desde 2007 a gente n o fala

426450 whether congress intended that laches as opposed to the statute of limitations be the sole timeliness defense available to 43 a claims
426451 we hold that the presumption of laches is triggered if any part of the claimed wrongful conduct occurred beyond the limitations period
426452 we further hold consistent with our precedent that in determining the presumption for laches the limitations period runs from the time the plaintiff knew or should have known about his 43 a cause of action this principle is grounded in the fact that laches penalizes inexcusable dilatory behavior if the plaintiff legitimately was unaware of the defendants conduct laches is no bar to suit in sum we presume that laches is not a bar to suit if the plaintiff files within the limitations period for the analogous state action the presumption is reversed if the plaintiff files suit after the analogous limitations period has expired for purposes of laches the limitations period may expire even though part of the defendants conduct occurred within the limitations period further the state limitations period runs from the time the plaintiff knew or should have known about his 43 a cause of action

426457 a losing litigant deserves no rematch after a defeat fairly suffered in adversarial proceedings on an issue identical in substance to the one he subsequently seeks to raise
426458 laches may apply whether or not any statutory limitations period runs
426459 o nce the statute of limitations has run the defendant is entitled to a presumption of laches which the plaintiff has to rebut
426460 the circumstances preceding and attending disclosure together with the conduct of the offeree acting with knowledge of the circumstances show a promise to pay of the type usually referred to as implied or implied in fact

426466 the actions taken by the t amp t cricket board is in keeping with our dispensation of not tolerating indiscipline in the sport in this country
426467 we see that indiscipline has been creeping into our game at all levels in the west indies and if the authorities dont take drastic action then the game would suffer as a consequence
426468 ponting was banned by the australian cricket board acb for one year for indiscipline in his early twenties and he came back all the better after this

426486 indeed the question has more often been whether the defense includes other kinds misuse besides antitrust violations and anti competitive conduct
426487 in most cases the moving party must first demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely before the other requirements for the other requirements for the issuance of an injunction will be considered
426488 to justify a temporary injunction it is not necessary that the

426490 no one will deny that the law should in some way effectively use expert knowledge wherever it will aid in settling disputes the question is as to how it can do so
426491 we cannot approve the length of the record which was due chiefly to the use of expert witnesses argument is argument whether in the box or at the bar and its proper place is the last the testimony of an expert upon such issues especially his cross examination greatly extends that trial and contributes nothing which cannot be better heard after the evidence is all submitted it ought not to be allowed at all and while its admission is not a ground for reversal it cumbers the case and tends to confusion for the more the court is led into the intricacies of dramatic craftsmanship the less likely it is to stand upon the firmer if more na ve ground of its considered impressions upon its own perusal we hope that in this class of cases such evidence may in the future be entirely excluded and the case confined to the actual issues that is whether the copyrighted work was original and whether the defendant copied it so far as the supposed infringement is identical
426492 when an expert is on the stand what are the methods resorted to quite the same as when it is a witness he is first examined in chief by the side which calls him assuming he has no direct evidence of facts to give he must be plied with hypothetical questions at as great length and in as great detail as seems necessary he is then handed over to the opposite side for cross examination there are two and only two possible efforts which the cross examiner will make first he may seek to bring out other general propositions favorable to his contention second he may seek to shake the validity of those already testified to similarly when it comes to the turn of the opposite side to submit evidence it has the same two possible objects to introduce evidence showing the invalidity of what the opposite experts have said or to bring out other general truths favorable to them the trouble with all this is that it is setting the jury to decide where doctor disagree the whole object of the expert is to tell the jury not facts as we have seen but general truths derived from his specialized experienced but how can the jury judge between two statements each founded upon an experience confessedly foreign in kind to their own it is just because they are incompetent for such a task that the expert is necessary at all what hope have the jury or some other layman of a rational decision between two such conflicting statements each based on such experience

426525 he evans is portraying me as mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant in my humble opinion i am none of those things
426526 the simple fact of the matter is that nothing of this sort happened my relationship with my protection team was always cordial certainly entirely professional this kind of absurd behaviour never occurred there are three references in his article to drinking on duty it is absolutely forbidden for police officers particularly in possession of firearms to drink on duty they did not do so
426527 the idea of them raiding my friends wine cellars then me asking them to pay for this is completely fictitious it is absurd the idea that they would lock me in a cupboard and go to the pub
426528 this is not a free speech issue this is libel there is a difference between those two things i can defend the truth i will not have my character destroyed and presented to the world as something that it is not i am not trying to prevent him from publishing his stupid book but if they publish it as it is there will be consequences and there will be a libel action

426624 patients in england shouldnt be treated as second class citizens they deserve fairer treatment and the phasing out of prescription charges in scotland and wales shows that this can be done by the government
426625 it is a shocking proposal and an attack on all local senior citizens and it has to be reversed
426626 pride is just simply the best event of its kind in the country and means a great day out for everyone its a highlight of the year for so many and thats why it attacts so many thousands of people to brighton each year as well as being enjoyed by local people of all ages
426627 im proud to have been a councillor in brighton in the 1980s when we decided that as a council we would not be bound by the tories discriminatory section 28 which caused such misery for many young gay and lesbian people
426628 while there is still a lot to do to combat inequlality and discrimination much has been achieved since those dark days
426629 same sex couples can adopt the ban on lesbian and gay people in the armed forces has been removed we have reformed the sexual offences act so that it is gender and sexuality neutral and invested in work at the local level to fight homophobia and hate crime

426635 there have been many rites of passage this week and most of them have been through the vaginal vault
426636 many of the domestic policy plans of john mccain have been notably short on details analysts caution that both mccain and barack obama have produced policy pronouncements that are just as much election documents as workable proposals after all that is what presidential candidates do but when it comes to the metric of paper produced mccain trails obama in spelling out the nitty gritty
426637 the obama people are much more detailed on budget matters the mccain goal is quite responsible but i cant see any way he could get there under the policies theyve been proposing theres a disconnect there
426638 mccain has not offered very much in specifics that i have seen
426639 republican faithful have grumbled in recent weeks about the lack of a consistent message from john mccains campaign on key issues leading observers to wonder what mccains top advisers are thinking
426640 some of mccains most visible and engaged advisers have advanced positions that appear to conflict with the arizona senators stances the ideological mishmash in mccains kitchen cabinet lends itself to questions about whos crafting the campaigns message mccain has staked out an eclectic and occasionally politically inconvenient hodgepodge of policy positions that has bucked the republican line on some issues backed it on others and on still others gone from bucking it to backing it
426641 mccains campaign has been sensitive to perceptions of conflicting agendas
426642 but many enjoyed the return of german pride and many more were too busy to care i was one of those who just thought the nazis were a bunch of fools so the majority just sat back and let it all happen then before we knew it they owned us and we had lost control and the end of the world had come my family lost everything i ended up in a concentration camp and the allies destroyed my factories

426649 the growth in the activities and membership of the harrisburg masonic shriners had by the end of the 1920s resulted in the demand for a grand new facility
426650 to punctuate this beauty would be the rise of the zembo shrine temple between 1928 and 1930 the design of which would represent the culmination of the career of harrisburg architect charles howard lloyd 1873 1937
426651 although the harrisburg masons were originally headquartered in the grand opera house at third and walnut streets which was destroyed by fire in 1907 and later at the masonic temple at third and state streets now the barto building the masons zembo temple chapter which was established in 1905 would ultimately seek its own building expressing its own identity the mid eastern themes traditionally associated with the shriners since their founding in new york city in 1872 were captured by lloyd within the context of art deco styling in the new facility adorned by a minaret tower elaborate tile work and dazzling interior spaces opening to a majestic auditorium the temple has long been the stage for famous personalities events and performances of national and international acclaim

426702 we got out muscled last week so the boys really wanted to put in a good performance we got the first couple of line outs then scored a couple of tries one anyway from a good set move

426709 what were the odds that florida was going to be within a thousandth of one percent
426710 its going to be close enough that a tie is definitely possible if its close its possible it becomes closer to 2 percent
426711 new mexico tends to mirror the national polls so when you see a national poll showing obama up 4 to 6 points thats a pretty good indicator
426712 the question is can obama resonate among hispanic democrats and rural democrats can he be seen as a regular guy
426713 if you go to a supermarket here theres a decent chance an obama worker is going to ask you to register to vote i think obama has a lead but i wouldnt bet a lot of money on it
426714 its something to almost prepare for and think through because it would really be a disaster

426729 i have resigned because the government has failed to implement its programmes and has gone against the charter
426730 the somali people knew there would be challenges on the path to peace and they should not be discouraged
426731 the authorities should remain focused on peace and i hope to see them shortly we must keep moving forward to ensure the agreement is fully implemented as soon as possible
426732 if the tfg is shared commodity between the various somali clans then the power of this tribalist man yeey and his bunch of ex ssdf clansmen should be curtailed
426733 the agreement will result according to my prognosis in the rupture or disintegration of one of these entities that signed it either further subdivision in the ranks of ars leadership which had already occurred or in the tfg which is in the offing it will definitely not make both of them laugh all the way to the bank
426734 the authorities should remain focused on peace and i hope to see them shortly i call on the president the speaker the prime minister and all members of the parliament to move forward i also call on the ars to continue to encourage reconciliation
426735 i welcome this important step by the transitional federal government and the for the re liberation of somalia and their continuing commitment to the agreement
426736 we must keep moving forward to ensure the agreement is fully implemented as soon as possible
426737 we were elected by the residents of the region lower shabelles regional authorities have no connection with the somali transitional federal government
426738 they have tried to force people to leave the region we have lost our confidence in the government
426739 the authorities should remain focused on peace and i hope to see them shortly i call on the president the speaker the prime minister and all members of the parliament to move forward i also call on the opposition ars alliance for the re liberation of somalia to continue to encourage reconciliation
426740 the somali people knew there would be challenges on the path to peace and they should not be discouraged
426741 as the end of the transition period is less than a year away i call on the somali people to remain united and solve their political problems
426742 i welcome this important step by the transitional federal government and the alliance for the re liberation of somalia and their continuing commitment to the agreement
426743 we must keep moving forward to ensure the agreement is fully implemented as soon as possible
426744 portraying me as mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant in my humble opinion i am none of those things
426745 got so fed up with his attitude that they locked him in a cupboard under the stairs and all went to the local pub for a pint or two
426746 when they were suitably refreshed they came back and let him out
426747 there are british passport holders who live in the uk who are being found in places like kandahar
426748 while my troops have not actually found british passports on enemy dead there has been a suspicion that with the high number of taliban casualties they have needed to recruit a lot of foreign fighters and some of these are likely to be of british muslim descent
426749 at least forty quid a night for special branch officers who were risking their lives to stop him being taken out by followers of the fatwa announced by irans ayatollah khomenei
426750 got so fed up with his attitude that they locked him in a cupboard under the stairs and then went to the local pub for a pint or two when they were suitably refreshed they came back and let him out
426751 he evans is portraying me as mean nasty tight fisted arrogant and extremely unpleasant in my humble opinion i am none of those things
426752 the simple fact of the matter is that nothing of this sort happened my relationship with my protection team was always cordial certainly entirely professional this kind of absurd behaviour never occurred there are three references in his article to drinking on duty it is absolutely forbidden for police officers particularly in possession of firearms to drink on duty they did not do so
426753 the idea of them raiding my friends wine cellars then me asking them to pay for this is completely fictitious it is absurd the idea that they would lock me in a cupboard and go to the pub
426754 this is not a free speech issue this is libel there is a difference between those two things i can defend the truth i will not have my character destroyed and presented to the world as something that it is not i am not trying to prevent him from publishing his stupid book but if they publish it as it is there will be consequences and there will be a libel action
426755 it is not our intention to comment on ron evans recollection and interpretation of specific events we regret that he chooses to publish this book there were a number of passages within the draft which caused us concern following legal advice we negotiated with the publishers to make some alterations
426756 you wont say anything when marios here but youll say it when hes not here youre a bully and you know it and you get away with murder but you wont get away with it with me
426757 what i was saying is you shouldnt have accepted my apology yesterday
426758 you said you accepted it and you shouldnt have if you didnt agree with what i was saying
426759 youre just sarcastic all the time i have a joke with you and you dont like it thats the point
426760 the cooking oh the food wont be as good cause im not cooking
426761 shut up dont talk to me rex youre a bully and youre an ass who dyou think you are
426762 theres a lot of attention today on global food shortages
426763 please someone shoot me right now so this horrible suffering may end
426764 new orleans is known for having a problem with lead paint
426765 some researchers even believe that lead poisoning is tied to the high rates of violence in the city so it seemed to me to be a good idea to find out about our house
426766 i considered a couple of testing options and then i found out about a free program offered by the non profit acorn association of community organizations for reform now
426767 they came out with a 30 000 piece of equipment that shoots gamma rays into the walls its something you could never afford to buy and couldnt rent either they also swabbed down surfaces
426768 i think a lot of people dont test because they are afraid of the answer they are worried they wont be able to sell their house if they know there is lead paint present
426769 it turns out we qualified to have the lead paint abated and our house painted for free
426770 all we would have to do was buy the paint i am not sure what it takes to qualify maybe it was the fact that we were about to have a child but whatever the reason its a great program
426771 but then i came home one day for lunch and there they were just as they had promised
426772 it turns out that a new coordinator had been assigned to the project and that i had been calling the wrong one
426773 scraping removes some but not all of the lead paint
426774 the idea is that its the paint that is flaking that can be hazardous because it can be ingested did you know that ingesting a flake of paint the size of a postage stamp can put lead levels over the limit in a young child
426775 the experience of having volunteers work on our house was humbling
426776 there was a group of unitarians from ohio another group of evangelical teenagers from around the country and even a guy from massachusetts who felt bad about the bush administrations response to katrina and just wanted to do something to help they came with no expectations of reward
426777 the wet scraping was almost done by the time they came back so it wasnt too bad
426778 we decided to go with his suggestions rather than agonize over colors
426779 so now the siding is light green some might say pistachio the trim and railings are all a pale yellow louis recommended cobalt blue for the steps and kind of a periwinkle for the lattice work and a sky blue for the ceiling of the porch
426780 the only thing im not sure about is that when you put these all together the house looks a bit like a pastel mardi gras i might have to get rid of the periwinkle
426781 first of all do you know how many windows we have
426782 we had at least 30 at last count there seems to be one more every time i count them and painting the sash a different color from the trim would have been a little too much detail for the volunteers plus christy and i think the plum window sash might be a little too fancy for us
426783 i got out the ladder and tried to unstick them and though i managed not to kill myself i did not manage to un stick the windows
426784 n o quero pagar o valor integral e n o ficar fidelizado a nada
426785 its about time that airport security is used on other forms of commercial travel like trains and buses yes its going to cost money but how much is your life worth
426786 i think toc h will be good for bristol they will build capacity at easton community centre and be beneficial for the residents of easton i was happy to be part of the process and think we made the right decision
426787 and since we have the same spirit of faith according to what is written i believed and therefore i spoke we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he who raised up the lord jesus will also raise us up with jesus and will present us with you for all things are for your sakes that grace having spread through the many may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of god
426788 then i will give them one heart and i will put a new spirit within them and they shall be my people and i will be their god
426789 but what does its say the word is near you in your mouth and in your heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if you confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that god has raised him from the dead you will be saved
426790 we may never know for sure whether he did it or not
426791 from the very beginning there has been speculation that the attacks were carried out by a biodefense zealot who wanted to prove that bioterrorism was a serious problem
426792 it would be unfortunate if the message people take away from this is that the only individuals we should be concerned about are deranged biodefense scientists

426899 tremendamente riguroso y se deniega una gran parte de ellas en la mayor a de los casos sin raz n suficiente
426900 en otro acto de autoritarismo insensibilidad y absoluto desconocimiento del funcionamiento del sistema educativo
426901 sino un acercamiento del puesto de trabajo al lugar que por razones de enfermedad resulta m s apropiado para el profesorado cercan a a un centro hospitalario evitar largos y penosos traslados diariamente poder asistir con regularidad a la debida atenci n m dica
426902 un beneficio para la ense anza al atender m s adecuadamente las necesidades de salud del profesorado o de sus familiares en primer grado dependientes en muchos casos y hacerlo sin p rdida de d as de clase
426903 va a incrementar necesariamente el n mero de bajas por enfermedad ya que es la nica salida que esta irracional e insensible consejera les est dando como respuesta a una humanitaria petici n de comisi n de salud que durante todos estos cursos y con gobiernos de todos los colores se han venido autorizando
426904 la visi n pesimista y negativa que este gobierno tiene sobre los trabajadores de la ense anza parece que se traduce en un ensa amiento en empeorar las condiciones de vida y de trabajo de estos servidores p blicos en castigo por no ser sumisos y obedientes acatando el preacuerdo de sexenios sometido a referendum
426905 parece que sta es una m s de una serie de venganzas que el gobierno de paulino rivero se ha propuesto llevar a cabo con el profesorado
426906 nunca se hab a visto en el gobierno de canarias una gente tan desconocedora de la educaci n tan autoritaria ni tan insensible pero todo puede ser a n susceptible de empeorar
426907 gran n mero de personas a los que se les ha denegado un derecho y un beneficio tanto para el profesor como para la ense anza

426910 cambian seg n el cristal con el que mira ruym n garc a
426911 ante los desaciertos aparecidos en prensa el pasado d a 31 de julio sobre el estado de las cuentas municipales en el ayuntamiento de valle gran rey el grupo municipal de coalici n canaria desea aclarar una serie de calumnias que han sido lanzadas por ruym n garc a
426912 el tr nsfuga pretende pasar por alto su etapa de m s de un a o como concejal de coalici n canaria en el ayuntamiento de valle gran rey es por ello que no se debe olvidar que se present a las elecciones por este partido
426913 en esa etapa ostent el cargo de primer teniente de alcalde con las facultades propias de alcalde de forma frecuente adem s fue concejal responsable de hacienda personal y planificaci n actuando con plenas capacidades para decidir y firmar todo
426914 por qu se empe a ruym n garc a en dar a entender que est llegando al ayuntamiento por primera vez y por qu hace tantos esfuerzos para decir que se est enterando del estado de las cuentas municipales y de la situaci n del personal en estos momentos
426915 ah est la clave afirman fue un aut ntico desastre gestionando los fondos del ayuntamiento y ahora pretende esconder sus errores denunci ndolos como si le fueran ajenos
426916 al seguir enga ando descaradamente a sus socios en el equipo de gobierno a los trabajadores del ayuntamiento y al pueblo que no le vot para un cargo que ya le queda grande ruym n garc a sigue demostrando que no sabe gestionar el ayuntamiento
426917 ruym n garc a deber a decirle de una vez a sus actuales socios de gobierno que form parte activa en el anterior equipo de gobierno de coalici n canaria y que fue el nico firmante y responsable de todo lo relacionado con la hacienda y el personal del ayuntamiento por tanto responsable absoluto de todo lo que hoy critica
426918 el tr nsfuga quiere hacer borr n y cuenta nueva pero eso es imposible ya que ruym n garc a no llega al ayuntamiento por primera vez su espejismo personal es fruto de su doble personalidad ya lo hab amos advertido dice las mentiras y encima se las cree
426919 los d as 6 y 7 de mayo se celebraron largas reuniones en el sal n de plenos del ayuntamiento en las que estuvieron presentes los concejales del equipo de gobierno incluido el ahora flamante alcalde y responsables de los distintos departamentos administrativos que tienen que ver con hacienda y personal
426920 en esa ocasi n se le manifest que estaba gestionando muy mal estas reas ya que todo lo hizo de forma unipersonal y caprichosa hipotecando al ayuntamiento a la carrera ten a contratados 119 trabajadores lo que supon a una sobrefacturaci n en gastos que el ayuntamiento no pod a asumir en ese momento se pararon dos contrataciones que ten a en marcha
426921 fue el inicio de su v a crucis para abandonar dos meses despu s nuestro grupo y caer en manos del psoe
426922 ellos dejaron legalmente resuelta una modificaci n de cr dito para pagar la n mina de todo el personal del ayuntamiento hasta el 31 de diciembre de 2008 siendo la cifra de 140 trabajadores otra de las mentiras del se or garc a
426923 si los considera elevados la culpa es exclusivamente suya los servicios de asesoramiento laboral pueden corroborar que las rdenes sal an de su departamento
426924 ruym n garc a ha pretendido falsear la realidad sembrando la alarma en el personal para tapar su incapacidad a la hora de propiciar soluciones adecuadas
426925 el ayuntamiento cuenta con determinados ingresos que se gestionan cotidianamente en base a la legalidad presupuestaria y cuenta tambi n con un techo crediticio en base a su capacidad presupuestaria que permite a acceder a planes de obras en colaboraci n con otras administraciones p blicas redundando en un beneficio del municipio

426991 did they throw away the locked doors from the triangle shirtwaist fire did they throw away the gas can used at the happy land social club fire thats what theyre doing at the world trade center the destruction and removal of evidence must stop immediately
426992 this is almost the dream team of engineers in the country working on this and our hands are tied
426993 i find the speed with which important evidence has been removed and recycled to be appalling
426994 officials in the mayors office declined to reply to written and oral requests for comment over a three day period about who decided to recycle the steel and the concern that the decision might be handicapping the investigation
426995 when we watched the pictures we felt so lucky our entire us operations were run out of the 16th floor

426999 in our investigation we have not uncovered a single piece of paper either here or in the treasure trove of information that has turned up in afghanistan and elsewhere that mentioned any aspect of the september 11 plot
427000 lawmakers leading the investigation of intelligence failures surrounding the 9 11 attacks are increasingly concerned that the cia and justice department are actively impeding their efforts the flare up centers on obstacles congressional investigators say the agencies have strewn in their path
427001 i have long admired and respected the work of adl and i appreciate your longstanding support of the fbi i know that under my predecessor louis freeh this partnership reached new heights i am absolutely committed to building on that relationship we in the fbi tremendously value your perspectives and your partnership your insights and research into extremism are particularly helpful to us shedding light on the changing nature of the terrorist threats facing america your support of hate crime and terrorist investigations which are now front and center in the work of the fbi is essential to us and the training and education you provide for the fbi and for law enforcement have never been more relevant that includes the conference on extremist and terrorist threats you are sponsoring later this month at the fbi academy
427002 you cannot stop us we have this anthrax you die now are you afraid death to america death to israel allah is great
427003 this is next take penacilin now death to america death to israel allah is great
427004 evidence linking these israelis to 9 11 is classified i cannot tell you about the evidence that has been gathered it is classified information
427005 could federal buildings in houston and other cities be under surveillance by foreign groups thats what some experts are asking after federal law enforcement and security officials nationally and in houston described for the 11 news defenders a curious pattern of behavior by a group of people claiming to be israeli art students
427006 hatchett says they could be doing what he would be doing if he were a terrorist sizing up the situation
427007 a former defense department analyst hatchett believes groups may be gathering intelligence for possible future attacks
427008 some organization thinking in terms of a potential retaliation against the u s government could be scouting out potential targets and looking for targets that would be vulnerable
427009 well that was just a serendipitous thirty six thats a pattern
427010 investigators within the dea ins and fbi have all told fox news that to pursue or even suggest israeli spying is considered career suicide
427011 a new middle east war of the general type and implications indicated will occur if certain specified incidents materialize
427012 contrary to widespread childish opinion most of the important things that happen in the world happen because powerful forces intend them to happen not because of some so called
427013 the terror attacks on sept 11 and extreme turmoil in the middle east point to one thing world war iii weve been fighting a war for the past 18 months which is the harbinger of world war iii the world is going to fight whether they like it or not im sure
427014 quite dangerous but postponing it would be more dangerous the problem today is not if but when
427015 what is at stake today is nothing less than the survival of civilization i have absolute confidence that if we the citizens of the free world led by president bush will marshal the enormous reserves of power at our disposal harness the steely resolve of a free people and mobilize our collective will to eradicate this evil from the face of the earth the international terrorist network is thus based on regimes iran iraq syria taleban afghanistan yasser arafats palestinian authority and several other arab regimes such as the sudan for the bin ladens of the world israel is merely a sideshow america is the target
427016 we are israelis we are not your problem your problems are our problems the palestinians are your problem
427017 spilled blood is seen as bond that draws 2 nations closer
427018 there is a moral equivalency and direct connection between americas continuous operations against al qaeda in afghanistan and any other israel defense forces operation to defeat terrorism
427019 they are acts of self defense against the same forces of evil and darkness bent on destroying civilized society
427020 i dont think palestinians celebrating the death of thousands of americans should go unchallenged
427021 neither the president nor the british prime minister will be deflected by saddams diplomatic charm offensive the feckless moralizing of peace lobbies or the unsolicited advice of retired generals
427022 getting ready for a vacation can be so hectic it certainly was for george w bush last week while laura bush left the white house early to get the ranch in crawford texas ready for a month long holiday one of the longest in presidential history the president rushed through some last minute errands
427023 this war which the bush government is a planning does not serve the basic interest in the long run of the american nation it serves the imperialistic interest of israel and the zionist groups who have now a great say in the american policy
427024 the world trade center will have to wait until im done reading about the little goat
427025 a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils sympathy for the favorite nation facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists and infusing into one nation the enmities of the other betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without justification it leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained and by exciting jealousy ill will and a disposition to retaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld and it gives to ambitious corrupted or deluded citizens who devote themselves to the favorite nation facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country without odium sometimes even with popularity gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation a commendable deference for public opinion or a laudable zeal for public good the foolish compliances of ambition corruption or infatuation
427026 we are israelis we are not your problem your problems are our problems the palestinians are your problem
427027 already there is near consensus as to the sequence of events that led to the collapse of the world trade center
427028 the project is in pre production stages and will go on floors later this year or early 2009 the casting is still in the initial stages and nothing has been finalised
427029 this individual for the public and this prime minister has generated an uproara which is perfectly understandable but we must respect the law
427030 im getting a little tired of that tag around our neck
427031 we are a lot more competitive than people give us credit for we challenge anyone on like items

427040 i was in union mo which is 98 percent white a rural conservative and what i said was what i think everyone knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
427041 there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this

427052 its very very helpful to have a student in the class who along with me remembers lyndon johnson and his presidency who remembers nixon who remembers jimmy carter
427053 younger students have read about and heard about it but they havent lived through those administrations and all the things that occurred then joann offers a very welcome perspective shes lived long enough to see a great deal
427054 i dont have that many more years to live and i want to do good for humanity while im here
427055 i was just trying to tell them but being circumspect on it
427056 i had no intent to mislead them and i never asked anyone to mislead them
427057 went out for drinks and there was a flirtation and you know something about dating quote unquote and text messages

427059 an attempt to influence the statements and testimony of potential witnesses in a commission proceeding

427071 i didnt set out to write an album i just wrote tracks when i was in different moods hence each track having different types of genres different influences
427072 this is the album i wanted to make it has a warm sound its very sexy and really tells a story
427073 guy j has emerged over the last couple of years with every production getting better and better i realised that guy had a great ear for making club tracks but with this album project guy has really pushed himself further musically delivering an album full of diversity with a warm melodic contemporary sound i feel this album would sit well setting you up for a night out helping you wind down at an after party or even just lazing by the pool the crisp beats and beautiful melodies lock you in from start to finish

427085 with the three other groups of bishops from your country i will have the occasion to continue my reflection on important topics for the churchs mission in canadian society marked by pluralism subjectivism and increasing secularism
427086 like many countries however canada is today suffering from the pervasive effects of secularism one of the more dramatic symptoms of this mentality clearly evident in your own region is the plummeting birth rate
427087 false dichotomies are not unknown within the christian community itself they are particularly damaging when christian civic leaders sacrifice the unity of faith and sanction the disintegration of reason and the principles of natural ethics by yielding to ephemeral social trends and the spurious demands of opinion polls democracy succeeds only to the extent that it is based on truth and a correct understanding of the human person catholic involvement in political life cannot compromise on this principle otherwise christian witness to the splendor of truth in the public sphere would be silenced and an autonomy from morality proclaimed
427088 while manifestations of sin abound greed and corruption betrayed relationships and exploitation of persons the recognition of individual sinfulness has waned
427089 not surprising this phenomenon is particularly pronounced in societies marked by secularist post enlightenment ideology where god is excluded from the public forum the sense of offence against god the true sense of sin dissipates just as when the absolute value of moral norms is relativized the categories of good or evil vanish along with individual responsibility
427090 within the context of the evangelization of culture i wish to mention the fine network of catholic schools at the heart of ecclesial life in your province
427091 a particularly insidious obstacle to education today which your own reports attests is the marked presence in society of that relativism which recognizing nothing as definitive leaves as the ultimate criterion only the self with its desires
427092 on february 26 1989 a few days before the coming into force of
427093 the church is isolating itself from its people its language and demeanor are causing it to distance itself from where life is happening in the world we need to be there and allow the gospel to transform our words and actions
427094 to help consecrated people live their specific vocation in authentic fidelity to the church and to her magisterium i therefore ask you to pay special attention to strengthening relations of trust with them and with their institutes

427110 hes not on our side anymore hes on washingtons side
427111 theres a certain arrogance about longevity up there with all the ability to raise money from special interest groups and the ability to use the federal budget to hand out earmarks they really do believe once there theyre there for good i dont think thats right

427127 me sorprende la asiduidad con la que el ex presidente del gobierno de espa a don felipe gonz lez trata los temas energ ticos en estos ltimos tiempos sobre todo lo referido a la energ a nuclear por supuesto es muy bueno que una persona de su nivel opine sobre el sistema energ tico y utilice su gran poder de convencimiento en lo que quiera pero me preocupa que lo haga tergiversando algunos datos que est n a disposici n de todos en las p ginas web de las instituciones del estado espa ol ministerio de industria turismo y comercio www mityc es red el ctrica espa ola www ree es y otros me refiero en concreto a que seg n se extrae de la prensa opina que la electricidad que consumimos los espa oles procede en gran medida de las nucleares francesas me apetece aclarar que no es as el sistema el ctrico espa ol datos de 2007 es del orden de 287 twh teravatios hora de los que aproximadamente 55 el 19 proceden de las nucleares espa olas y 5 3 1 8 vienen de los intercambios el ctricos con francia por otro lado tambi n ser bueno saber que ese mismo a o 2007 espa a envi 7 4 twh a portugal y 3 5 a marruecos con lo cual el saldo final fue de 5 8 twh netos que exportamos a nuestros pa ses vecinos me parece que de esos datos no se pueden sacar las conclusiones que algunos pol ticos periodistas e incluso sindicalistas han extra do de que los espa oles somos muy hip critas porque nos oponemos a la nuclear y no nos importa consumir electricidad nuclear procedente de francia al margen de esto desde luego creo firmemente que seguimos sin tener una pol tica energ tica en espa a y en europa que se corresponda con las dificultades que tenemos en el horizonte inmediato y que ya se dejan ver

427172 significant numbers appear to hold beliefs which contravene democratic values
427173 these results are deeply embarrassing for those who have said there is no extremism in british universities
427174 our researchers found a ghettoized mentality among muslim students at queen mary college
427175 also we found the segregation between muslim men and women at events more visible at queen mary
427176 clearly we in no way associate ourselves with these views however also integral to the spirit of university life is free speech and debate and on occasion speakers will make statements that are deemed offensive
427177 this disgusting report is a reflection of the biases and prejudices of a right wing think tank not the views of muslim students across britain only 632 muslim students were asked vague and misleading questions and their answers were willfully misinterpreted

427278 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
427279 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined
427280 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
427281 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
427282 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
427283 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
427284 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
427285 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
427286 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
427287 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
427288 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
427289 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
427290 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
427291 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
427292 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
427293 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
427294 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

427309 and i watch my words from a long way off they are more yours than mine
427310 and let me talk to you with your silence that is bright as a lamp simple as a ring you are like the night with its stillness and constellations your silence is that of a star as remote and candid
427311 you are taken in the net of my music my love and my nets of music are wide as the sky my soul is born on the shore of your eyes of mourning in your eyes of mourning the land of dreams begins
427312 between the lips and the voice something goes dying something with the wings of a bird something of anguish and oblivion the way nets cannot hold water my toy doll only a few drops are left trembling even so something sings in these fugitive words something sings something climbs to my ravenous mouth oh to be able to celebrate you with all the words of joy
427313 in you the rivers sing and my soul flees in them as you desire and you send it where you will aim my road on your bow of hope and in a frenzy i will free my flock of arrows
427314 i feel your eyes traveling and the autumn is far off grey beret voice of a bird heart like a house towards which my deep longings migrated and my kisses fell happy as embers
427315 the moon turns its clockwork dream the biggest stars look at me with your eyes and as i love you the pines in the wind want to sing your name with their leaves of wire
427316 how i love to see my dear indolent one the skin of your body so beautiful shimmering like an undulating fabric your dark hair with acrid perfumes is a vagabond and odiferous sea of brown and blue waves like a ship awakening to the morning wind my dreaming soul sets sail for a distant land your eyes which reveal nothing whether sweet or bitter are two jewels in which iron and gold are mixed to see you walk in that swaying rhythm one would think of a snake dancing to the end of a stick of a snake charmer under the burden of your laziness your childs head lolls with the softness of a young elephant and your body lists and lengthens like a light narrow sailboat which rolls from side to side until the sails dip into the water like a stream fattened by the melting of grinding glaciers when the saliva rises to the edge of your teeth i think im drinking a bohemian wine sharp and overpowering a liquid sky which sprinkles my heart with stars

427560 since my mother mistook me for my younger brother william i have had recurring dreams nightmares from my youth
427561 i am on a ship on the journey that took me and my brother abroad to these dry lands there is a plague and soon everyone onboard becomes afflicted by it many people die painfully and loudly it is terrible
427562 with the few that remain i help to heap the dead and we soak them with a liquid as i throw in a flame and watch the fire rise i hear my brothers call from within i try to get closer but i am pulled back by a stranger in my struggle i see a face within the fire but it is not my brothers face in the fire it is me who is dead i abandon the ship leaving it to burn
427563 my recovery was a long time ago and i dont recall knowing much at all from before i woke in the infirmary at the institute the magic of a magus had cured my sickness but the plague had already dislocated my memory names faces places all known to me even then but none correlated
427564 i was found wearing this coat and it was inside a pocket that the magus discovered the letter of acceptance to study at their institute a letter addressed to joseph so they had called me joseph and i assumed them correct so joseph is who i became i doubt that now
427565 i remember the coat never fitting me it was too big then and i dont know why i kept it for so long there was no sense too you know its too hot here for such a heavy garment
427566 by the time i fully recovered the lessons had started even though i had retained my thinking ability it was grueling for me to write that first letter home with aid i finally wrote to my parents and told them about the tragic death of their son william
427567 oh how i feared to meet my parents i feared i would not recognize them and so i told them not to worry of me they wanted to come to me but i told them not to giving false but convincing excuses about the demands of my study when our son was born they insisted and i did not withstand
427568 reuniting with them on the docks my plagued memory started its resurface you remember how elated i was i recognized them it felt astonishing to believe but when mother called me william i did not at first make the connection i corrected her and now even she believes i am the older brother
427569 i have been the man joseph for longer than i remember being the boy william if i am william again do i rob joseph of his accomplishments
427570 if i stay as joseph then is william truly dead it was joseph who was to attend the institute and i was intended only to accompany him for a short time until he settled is a name only a name if my family also believe i am joseph then are our old and forgotten memories worthy of consideration

427578 we are firmly convinced and we act on that conviction that with nations as with individuals our interests soundly calculated will ever be found inseparable from our moral duties and history bears witness to the fact that a just nation is trusted on its word when recourse is had to armaments and wars to bridle others
427579 i was against the surge before i was for it
427580 yea verily i am a citizen of the milky way
427581 ive uh been in guant namo bay for two years
427582 stripping off in front of them rubbing their breasts in their faces not all the guys would speak theyd come back from the brown block the interrogation block and be quiet for days and cry to themselves so you know something went on but you dont know what but for the guys who did speak thats what we heard
427583 screeches and bangs these would be played across the brown block into all the interrogation rooms you cant describe it screeches bangs compressed gas all sorts of things jumbled noises
427584 not computer generated industrial strange noises and mixed in with it would be something like an electronic piano not as in music because there was no rhythm to it
427585 yes a synthesiser mixed in with industrial noises all a jumble and a mishmash
427586 did you ever ask them why are you blasting these strange noises at us
427587 when the cd was finished he came back into the room and said you might like this
427588 just playing me a cd see if i like music or not now ive heard this im thinking there must have been something else going on now im thinking why did they play that same cd to me as well theyre playing this cd in iraq and theyre playing the same cd in cuba it means to me there is a programme theyre not playing music because they think people like or dislike matchbox twenty more than other music or kris kristofferson more than other music there is a reason theres something else going on obviously i dont know what it is but there must be some other intent
427589 you dont know how deep the rabbit hole goes do you but you know it is deep you know it is deep
427590 you mean they did it just because it seemed so weird
427591 i can imagine that might work on a devout muslim from an arab country but jamal is british he was raised in manchester he knows all about ghetto blasters and fleetwood mac and country and western music
427592 on a surface level that would be ridiculous but guant namo and abu ghraib were anything but surface
427593 most interesting but i havent a clue i know that subliminal messages can be incorporated and that they have a powerful influence there are laws prohibiting it in the us but im not aware of any uses like you describe i would imagine however that it would be classified and no one without a need to know would be aware anyway if it were frequencies it would probably need to be in the audible range or they wouldnt need to mask them with other sounds
427594 you can bet this activity was purposeful if you can get anybody to talk to you about this it would be interesting to know the success rate of this technique
427595 strikes me the story you tell is just plain kindness which still exists
427596 re your assertion he was innocent if so how did he get captured in afghanistan dont think there were many british tourists who happened to be travelling there when our forces arrived or maybe he was a cultural anthropologist studying the progressive social order of the taliban as part of his doctoral dissertation and was mistakenly detained from his education perhaps if you believe this mans story youd also be interested in buying a bridge from me as for the music i have no idea what that might be about guess hard rockers might take that as cruel and unusual punishment and want to report it to amnesty international as proof of torture
427597 is there anything you can tell me about the use of subliminal sounds and frequencies in the militarys arsenal if anyone alive today is equipped to answer that question surely you are
427598 i dont know much about this subject but im sure ive seen your name linked with something called a psycho correction device
427599 how would you do that blast someone with silent sounds without it affecting us anybody whos out there would hear it
427600 very low frequency sound which can travel long distances and easily penetrate most buildings and vehicles biophysical effects nausea loss of bowels disorientation vomiting potential internal organ damage or death may occur
427601 involves influencing subjects visually or aurally with embedded subliminal messages
427602 these people are despairing because they are being held lawlessly
427603 theres no end in sight theyre not being brought before any independent judges theyre not being charged and convicted for any crime
427604 theyre in a worse situation than convicted criminals and its an act of desperation
427605 they have no regard for life either ours or their own i believe this was not an act of desperation but an act of asymmetrical warfare waged against us
427606 if its perfectly legal and theres nothing going wrong there well why dont they have it in america and then the american court system can supervise it

427611 i thought he was a very inconsiderate person he never picked up the mess when his dog crapped on my lawn

427623 i never hire a copywriter who says they can write about anything

427625 you can get the answers to these questions very quickly with a few key strokes

427665 saarc must make its voice heard in the councils of the world to ensure that there is an effective global response that protects the interests of oil consuming countries
427666 the unprecedented increase in oil and food prices risks jeopardising our developmental gains
427667 im disappointed it is just a feeble excuse for doing nothing about salt levels they dont want to lower salt levels because they are nervous about consumer reaction and people not liking the taste with less salt
427668 if you have not got sufficient preservative in a product like ham you get pockets where the salt levels are too low to prevent the formation of the botulism toxin
427669 this will force us to reduce it the shelf life further and with that come serious food safety concerns not least the risk of botulism
427670 we are very worried about the stricter targets and believe that reducing salt further has implications for food safety and shelf life of products
427671 we are already getting complaints from retailers that consumers dont like the blandness of many sandwiches to meet existing salt targets sandwich makers dont add salt to sandwiches at all but it is in products such as cheese bacon and ham well soon be at a point where people stop buying sandwiches and make them at home where they add as much salt as they want this would affect an important industry we sell 2 8 billion packs of sandwiches a year with a market value of 5 25 billion pounds
427672 we are already reformulating many recipes but we have got reports that consumers dont like the taste especially in some healthy ranges of meals such as lasagne where there has been a decline in sales
427673 peter sherratt the general secretary of the salt association said that feed back from its members suggested that the agency targets had gone too far
427674 the federal government welcomes the decision of the iaea board of governors and the indian government to further efforts to bring india into the system of nuclear non proliferation
427675 india has taken an important step towards the global non proliferation regime thus in the future more civilian nuclear facilities will be under the control and safeguards system of iaea
427676 meets the standards of the iaea and thus contributes to enhancing the international non proliferation system
427677 this assessment carries particular weight as the iaea is the guardian of the non proliferation regime
427678 at the same time we hope to see further progress in the area of nuclear non proliferation india for example is one of a group of countries whose ratification is essential for the nuclear test ban treaty to take effect a moratorium on the production of fissile material for military purposes would also be desirable
427679 there is anger among people over the death of two children in the town most people have kept their establishments closed following a call given by the gondwana republican party and the samajwadi party
427680 the hostel management says that the boys died because of a fall in the toilet but the people suspect some foul play we are however investigating the matter security all over the town mainly around the ashram and the hostel run by it has been beefed up to avoid any untoward incident
427681 only the parents and the guardians interested to see their children or who want to take them back are being allowed entry inside the premises no untoward incident has been reported since morning
427682 this has to be looked at now against the background of an unprecedented rise in the prices of hydrocarbon fuels and food
427683 our vulnerability to these shocks is more than that of many other countries
427684 these daunting challenges demand that poverty reduction efforts in south asia should have a comprehensive approach and be focused and result oriented

427688 we welcome dots decision to open internationally harmonised bands namely 450 1900 amp 2100 mhz bands for 3g services cdg also hopes that the dot will make spectrum available in the 450 amp 1900 mhz bands for auction at the earliest
427689 the indian governments 3g policy is a fair and transparent way of allocating additional spectrum amongst the indian service providers furthermore the automatic extension of the underlying 2g licences will ensure continuity and stability of service and is in the interest of indian consumers
427690 in pakistan terrorism and its sanctuaries are gaining a deeper grip as demonstrated by the tragic assassination of benazir bhutto
427691 while existing on the absolute fringes of our tolerant and peace loving societies terrorists in our region receive institutional nurturing and support it is this embedded nature of terrorists that make it a much more sinister threat
427692 while the people of afghanistan today are bearing the brunt of international terrorism on a daily basis it is with tremendous trepidation that we are watching the wild fire of terrorism spreading across the region

427695 the odd numbered arrangement will always look better than two or four or six pots together no one knows why

427708 it is an exciting signing everyone is talking about him
427709 hes a talented kid hes a skilful player im sure hell excite the fans
427710 getting him here excites me and shows the kind of football im looking to play at blackburn
427711 hes not only good on the basketball court but also off it hes a good person not just a good player
427712 in the last two years hes started to look like a great player he is the first of the really big guys who could really play
427713 the others couldnt really move certainly his height is pretty incredible but he is very skilful so i dont think it is his height alone if yao was a little shorter i think he would still be a great player
427714 yao is just tremendous i think every sports league in the world would dream of having him
427715 i think its a win win situation the nba has yao ming there and that draws more attention from china
427716 and yao ming playing at the highest level can help raise the standard of chinese basketball and maybe make a breakthrough in olympic results
427717 i think being as big as he is pretty clearly does put unusual stress on his feet

427723 there has been a lot of interest in scaling down optical devices
427724 its really a very simple geometry and i was surprised that no one had come up with it before
427725 previously if you wanted to transmit light at a smaller scale you would lose a lot of energy along the path to retain more energy youd have to make the scale bigger these two things always went against each other
427726 now this work shows there is the possibility to gain both of them
427727 we are pulling optics down to the length scales of electrons
427728 and that means we can potentially do some things we have never done before

427760 why him out of everyone what makes him so fucking special
427761 a mere ten minutes could determine everything from the fate of a simple individual to that of an entire empire you are not a guardian quencus and you therefore are connected to the space time continuum in a way that virtually all things in the multiverse are despite the powers i have given you and even i as a guardian have certain limits when it comes to time
427762 quencus you have been my service for two years in terms of your life yet you somehow havent refrained from calling me either master or sir you are no longer a student scholar of the yuxurian academy and i am not a chief scholar i am the white guardian and you may refer to me as simply the guardian you should not refer to me in the manner as a private would to his superior or a slave to his master
427763 now on to the reason of why i have summoned you as i have just said quencus my relationship with time itself is very different to yours and to the vast majority of beings within the cosmos because of this i am able to detect changes in it that you cannot for this reason i can detect when the key to time must be reassembled and other such cosmic events and very recently i have felt a terrible change within the space time continuum
427764 no but something just as serious indeed it concerns the fate of an individual and if his destiny is changed then the impact upon reality could be truly devastating tell me quencus do you know of brigadier sir alistair gordon lethbridge stewart
427765 the british contingent to be precise running it from 1968 till 1976 anno domini before taking charge of it again in 2008 anno domini spends half of his time out of britain though so that colonel mace often has to take charge
427766 the brigadier practically founded unit his experience in the london underground previously that year giving the united nations the proof that such an organisation was required as well as that he has shown much courage through his lifetime and has saved the earth many times now let me show you what this change i am envisioning could do to all of reality
427767 yes they are tobias vaughn and the second incarnation of the doctor
427768 vaughn as you know was the head of international electromatics during the years known as the 60s and collaborated with the cybermen in their invasion attempt of earth he being the chairman of the worlds biggest manufacturer of electrical appliances was therefore able to put emotional circuits in to all of his products which when set off would bring virtually all of the population of the planet under cyber control vaughn was then planning to double cross the cybermen by using machines built by professor watkins which would use emotion against the cybermen this then would leave him in charge of the populace of earth thankfully for the planet the doctor and his companions with help from the brigadier and unit managed to defeat both vaughn and the cybermen but in the new timeline well see for yourself quencus
427769 even if you do manage to get watkins to produce these machines the cybermen would have long betrayed you before then cant you see you cant possibly trust them
427770 oh doctor you dont appear to still understand i run this invasion without me it cannot possibly be completed and if the cybermen do turn on me it will be at a time when i am ready for them and then doctor i shall have power dont you see the world is weak vulnerable a mess of uncoordinated and impossible ideals it needs a strong man a single mind a leader
427771 we no longer need you we will now take full control over the invasion
427772 our invasion fleet is approaching the planet once it arrives all human beings will be converted into cybermen you will become like us
427773 for the entire human race to be converted into them the cybermen cold brutal emotionless beings
427774 you think youre indestructible well i can destroy all of you
427775 vaughn now listen to me vaughn were on the same side now we must rescue jamie zoe isobel and the professor from your factory and then we must stop the cybermen
427776 then we must find a way to destroy them these depolarizers were wearing the very things stopping us from going under cyber control right now youve got some more obviously
427777 we must find a military base put depolarizers on the soldiers we have no choice but to destroy the cybermen utterly
427778 and if i survive what will the world do with me then doctor
427779 stop thinking about yourself think about the billions of lives at stake
427780 appealing to my better nature i see no if i help you it will be because i hate them the cybermen my allies the destroyers of my dream
427781 yes ill help you doctor ill help you because i hate them
427782 vaughn what have you done to us all what have you done
427783 we have just a single machine theyre just too strong and powerful
427784 despite your victory over this planet today despite converting my companions into cybermen despite my death you will still face the inevitability of your destruction one day a race powerful enough one whom opposes your evil will destroy you and then the universe will be forever free of you then no more will races have to fear their planets being invaded they will no longer fear their families being converted into you the entire universe will be rid of you and good riddance i say
427785 this is a new timeline a timeline in which the doctor unfortunately perishes
427786 what did you notice different about the events shown to the events which have played out in this timeline
427787 yes well done the timeline in which i foresee the brigadier is never born and because of it there was nobody who could assist the doctor and his companions against vaughn and the cybermen and this time he couldnt do it alone im afraid now what enemies of the doctor would benefit the most out of his premature death
427788 with nobody to stop them at their creation the daleks advanced a thousand years sooner then they should have they utterly exterminated the entire thal race there were no defeats which slowed them such as the movellan war no force in the cosmos could stop them not even the time lords in the timeline i foresee quencus not only the universe but all of reality itself will be under their control
427789 we must indeed quencus this is the very reason as to which i have brought you here we must secure the existence of brigadier sir alistair gordon lethbridge stewart

428071 we were able to image dark energy in action as it stretches huge supervoids and superclusters of galaxies
428072 when a microwave enters a supercluster it gains some gravitational energy and therefore vibrates slightly faster
428073 later as it leaves the supercluster it should lose exactly the same amount of energy but if dark energy causes the universe to stretch out at a faster rate the supercluster flattens out in the half billion years it takes the microwave to cross it thus the wave gets to keep some of the energy it gained as it entered the supercluster
428074 dark energy sort of gives microwaves a memory of where theyve been recently
428075 with this method for the first time we can actually see what supervoids and superclusters do to microwaves passing through them
428076 this is the first observation that really pins down that titan has a surface lake filled with liquid
428077 detection of liquid ethane confirms a long held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on titan
428078 the fact we could detect the ethane spectral signatures of the lake even when it was so dimly illuminated and at a slanted viewing path through titans atmosphere raises expectations for exciting future lake discoveries by our instrument
428079 on this moon clouds with convective movements are formed and therefore static electrical fields and stormy conditions can be produced this also considerably increases the possibility of organic and prebiotic molecules being formed according to the theory of the russian biochemist alexander i opar n and the experiment of stanley l miller who managed to synthesise organic compounds from inorganic compounds through electrical discharges that is why titan has been one of the main objectives of the cassini huygens joint mission of nasa and the european space agency
428080 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
428081 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
428082 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars

428161 despite themselves washington decision makers actually used history in their decisions whether they knew it or not
428162 build the channels through which relevant and relevantly packaged research results of historians philosophers and sociologists of science and technology may flow to policy makers let us come to the aid of our perplexed bretheren in the sciences
428163 opportunities for direct involvement in science policy have remained scarce experience further suggests that historians who have taken up the demand have struggled to balance subtlety with clarity nuanced appraisal with straight talk authentic policy relevant history is not an oxymoron but it is a challenge

428167 every incident has to be seen within its proper framework you study an incident as an incident
428168 an incident is an incident and a crime is a crime
428169 it is as if there is a struggle each against the other and it creates a sectarian atmosphere
428170 this tense atmosphere makes people ready to explode at any point if they are subjected to any amount of instigation or incitement
428171 muslims cant say it but its clear they dont accept us here no one can speak the truth on this issue so everybodys feelings are kept inside
428172 when something happens it always comes back to muslim and christian
428173 if someone cant resolve it they go to the police station
428174 we feel pressure maybe not all the time but we do
428175 we have liberty of speech and religion but its as if somebody was telling us at the same time dont speak and dont practice your religion
428176 me i try to keep a certain distance from muslims
428177 we have simple relations i give you this you give me this thats it they dont want more than that either
428178 only content to send security forces after clashes catch fire
428179 the religious discourse has to change from both sides because it incites hatred even if it does so indirectly increasing fanaticism from both sides
428180 for us to learn how to safely grow our food inside in environmentally controlled multistory buildings within urban centers if we do not then in just another 50 years the next 3 billion people will surely go hungry
428181 is sustainably harvested and carefully controlled by the malaysian government to insure the long term biodiversity of its rain forests while providing an economic resource for its industries and people
428182 he was trying to make a statement to the american people that the government took conservation of resources seriously
428183 and were at a very challenging moment in american history and global history
428184 the first thing id like to do is remove the airport property
428185 working with the feds the federal aviation administration that kind of overwhelms me
428186 if we ever wanted to come back and use it we cant fill that hole
428187 what troubles me is when we adopt something its going to be more restrictive were going to immediately be challenged in two arenas one of them is in court one of them is in the legislature
428188 i think the large landowners will defend themselves if their property rights have been infringed
428189 thats why we have courts thats why we have a legislature
428190 where does it leave families and their children who are stuck in failing schools
428191 thats not john mccain hes just a guy who wouldnt pander to anyone
428192 he will tell you whats on his mind i would consider it one of his strengths
428193 if he says he will help you he will do it
428194 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
428195 claro lo sigue haciendo porque miguel todav a est peque o
428196 look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
428197 he brought up the issue i responded to it because im disappointed and i dont want the issue to be part of this campaign
428198 were going to display a sense of humor in this campaign
428199 the panhandle will matter let me just say i need your support ive always put my country first
428200 im excited about the republican party not john mccain but hes better than a democrat
428201 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
428202 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
428203 her current doctors felt like it would interfere with her progress
428204 and that she would not be able to overcome that she would lose ground so we made a call on familys behalf
428205 we are extremely pleased that she will be able to stay in her facility
428206 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
428207 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
428208 if senator obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
428209 with that kind of track record senator mccain should be the last person lecturing senator obama about a commitment to quality education for our nations children
428210 i think the united states of america has reached the point where we should provide equal economic opportunity for all americans
428211 that frankly is something that i dont think helps anyone
428212 he handled himself very well given the crowd and his positions
428213 it would have been nice to see him compare and contrast himself less with obama but focus more on his positions
428214 still needs to go to school on affirmative action and the real impact
428215 i do not think this country is in a place where we all have an equal opportunity
428216 hopefully when we get there we wont need the programs but we arent there yet
428217 i can hear and listen to the passion caring and concern involved that you have expressed so eloquently
428218 i do have an idea what its like to be deprived of your rights
428219 i learned to love america when i was deprived of its company
428220 what you did not hear in there was the usual run of the mill political rhetoric
428221 if your concern is if this is going to help or hurt a campaign youre thinking the wrong considerations
428222 for the soldiers the pleasure for them is to have you
428223 last week senator obama skipped a visit with wounded u s troops at landstuhl regional medical center in germany because the pentagon would not allow campaign staff or media to accompany him into the hospital i served as director of trauma surgery at that hospital for nearly four years and saw the effect that a visit from a celebrity like senator obama could have on morale during that time i do not recall a single member of congress canceling a visit with the troops despite being just a few hours away but senator obama seems to have been more concerned with how the visit would affect him than how it would affect the soldiers recovering from wounds received in the service of their country
428224 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
428225 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
428226 its also important to recognize if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for ten years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices every expert agrees on that
428227 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
428228 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
428229 why is it that you have not had the ability to speak to the interests or even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community the black community in this country
428230 the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a simple question
428231 if we want to create jobs we should do more to make work pay for ordinary americans
428232 across this country americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face
428233 i do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems there is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses
428234 i may not have spoken out the way you would have wanted me to speak out
428235 which gives you the option of voting for somebody else
428236 my attitude is that we can find some sort of compromise
428237 if it is part of an overarching package then i am not going to be rigid in preventing an energy package that goes forward that is really thoughtful and is going to really solve the problem
428238 no plan for addressing the energy challenges that we face
428239 we decided there were certain issues that were not going to get us to 60 votes
428240 why should we put something in the package that was going to be a lightning rod
428241 unfortunately the proposal would eliminate floridas 2006 gulf protections and give floridians absolutely no voice in determining where exploration could occur
428242 fifty miles off the coast would cut the heart and the lungs out of the united states military because the largest testing and training area for the department of defense in the world is the gulf of mexico off of florida thats something he needs to know
428243 we are not going to drill our way out of this problem we have 3 percent of the worlds oil reserves we use 25 percent of the worlds oil
428244 and when i am president i will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
428245 we have to win florida there is no doubt about that
428246 we need to drill more drill now and pay less at the pump
428247 they obamas campaign have a problem with older women voters
428248 i welcome todays bipartisan effort as an important step in the process of reducing our dangerous dependence on foreign oil
428249 includes steps that i havent always supported i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
428250 youll hear from my opponent sen obama tomorrow and if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
428251 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric and this is especially true in the case of the urban leagues agenda of opportunity
428252 charter schools are not the answer but they are part of the answer
428253 dont you also feel an obligation to the next generation of young americans who are growing up in poverty and do not have access to a quality education
428254 why in an america where there are disparities alarming disparities would you want to eliminate programs that document that so we understand where we are and where we need to go
428255 affirmative action is in the eye of the beholder we should provide equal economic opportunities for all americans
428256 our ability to assist small businesses the economically disadvantaged and others
428257 i find it interesting that mccain would address a group full of african americans obviously appealing to a particular race but when obama addresses anything to do with race hes playing the race card there seems to be a conflict
428258 although i found there were some disconnects i have to admit that i was able to at least connect with him a little bit simply because he came and addressed us
428259 i think thats the first step in building a relationship
428260 we need oil drilling and we need it now we need it offshore the only thing ive heard him say is we should inflate our tires
428261 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together black white hispanic asian native american young old disabled gay straight
428262 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago
428263 do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
428264 oil companies have made not because of their investments not because of their ingenuity and skill but just because of the increase in gas prices
428265 falls entirely on a windfall then it wont have any economic distortions associated with it
428266 there were mistakes made in the way this was done in 1980
428267 brings in fresh ideas to a certain extent the republican party has failed young people when i look at my granddaughter with all the debt we have we need some fresh ideas and new concepts
428268 i saw him being honest i saw him being sincere
428269 the average net profit margin for the s amp p energy sector according to figures from thomson baseline is 9 7 the average for the s amp p 500 is 8 5 so yes energy companies are more profitable than many others but not by an inordinate amount
428270 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
428271 if senator obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
428272 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
428273 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
428274 he doesnt look like those other presidents on those dollar bills
428275 to stay focused on creating jobs for our people and protecting paychecks from the rising costs of food gasoline and most everything else
428276 whos counting theres 95 days we need your help florida will be a battleground state so we are going to need all your help
428277 said lina reyes a resident of nearby azalea park when she tried to talk to the senator outside
428278 i couldnt even finish the sentence but i know how these things are
428279 everybody was saying how humble he is how personable he is and he made a very positive impression to everyone who was there
428280 many of his answers showed me that he was not in touch with his audience
428281 he did a good job of standing in there and taking the punches
428282 but i cant say i was satisfied with his answers
428283 tendr narices lo que nos est costando la guerra de irak
428284 i believe i can win it but i have a lot of work to do
428285 i think its long overdue that sen obama acknowledge that the surge succeeded

428289 one in eight nhs hospital patients still has to wait more than a year for treatment the government acknowledged yesterday in its first attempt to tell the full truth about health service queues in england
428290 q2 overall how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the running of the national health service nowadays
428291 an elderly iraqi woman shows two bullets which she says hit her house following an early coalition forces raid in the predominantly shiite baghdad suburb of sadr city
428292 the democratic debate over the future of new orleans somehow passed over the instructive example of valmeyer ill in 1993 the town of 900 was swamped not for the first time by a rain swollen mississippi river it hasnt been swamped since because its not there anymore rather than remain in a vulnerable spot the residents voted to relocate their village to a bluff 400 feet above the river
428293 new orleans like valmeyer had long been a natural disaster waiting to happen most of the city lies below sea level surrounded by water on three sides and its sinking on top of that its steadily grown more exposed to hurricanes thanks to the loss of coastal wetlands that once served as a buffer its a bathtub waiting to be filled
428294 the cost of the levee system envisioned by sen clinton is tabbed at 40 billion restoring other infrastructure would increase the cost the question is whether thats the best use of our resources for 40 billion you could give more than 61 000 to every louisianan displaced by katrina nearly a quarter of a million dollars for a family of four
428295 many if not most would choose the cash that option may be especially appealing since the new levee system cant be completed before 2015
428296 i believe i can win it but i have a lot of work to do
428297 we were looking for something to do and this is the hottest ticket in town
428298 i need your support i will put my country first as president of the united states
428299 i think its long overdue that sen obama acknowledge that the surge succeeded
428300 maybe heaven is being buried underground and being eaten by a maggot and that maggot turns into a fly and the fly is eaten by something else id be cool with that
428301 but i guess its unavoidable when you play cornerstone youre signed on tooth amp nail and youre lead singer cant stop talking about god on and off the stage
428302 i dont know weve never been clear on that one i have to be afraid of making bold claims of who i am and how faithful i am as little faith as i have in god i have much less faith in this world so i have to go with the lesser of two passions
428303 i dont feel very comfortable in the christian subculture environment
428304 the main reason i can try to justify even being in a band is to communicate to the people who are gonna come to these kinds of gatherings and listen to our band just because we are on tooth and nail records and say to them you know what jesus called us to do is to come and die suffer and sacrifice lay down our lives for other people not try to live the most comfortable life we can or have a whole lot of fun or look a certain way
428305 oh why would i do this tooth amp nail tour that wont help us in the general market
428306 i want to encourage and give hope whether its to people who were born christian or people who never considered god
428307 im not trying to convert anyone but i want to tell people how great i feel
428308 oh my girlfriend broke up with me and im jealous of her new boyfriend
428309 theres only one true motivation behind what i do and thats love for everybody
428310 and its difficult to communicate love through songs you cant give people hugs in a cd so theres a tension there and i feel like thats part of why i do what i do i want to express things that transcend the music
428311 of course if i dont sing about god in a way that christian bookstores want to hear then i dont expect to be embraced by that side of the market and if we dont rock enough we may not be embraced by kids who liked the last record
428312 either way im just trying to find the things that will bring me contentment in my life
428313 talking a bit about faith what are your ideas on the whole christian band thing its become more and more present in the past few years with a lot of mainstream bands saying were not a christian band were just christians who love playing music what are your thoughts on the whole division there
428314 if we did things your way we would be an apologetics and theology store and be closed in a month

428357 about 20 of u s carbon dioxide emissions comes from the burning of gasoline in internal combustion engines of cars and light trucks minivans sport utility vehicles pick up trucks and jeeps vehicles with poor gas mileage contribute the most to global warming for example according to the e p as 2000 fuel economy guide a new dodge durango sports utility vehicle with a 5 9 liter engine that gets 12 miles per gallon in the city will emit an estimated 800 pounds of carbon dioxide over a distance of 500 city miles in other words for each gallon of gas a vehicle consumes 19 6 pounds of carbon dioxide are emitted into the air
428358 e85 is a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent ordinary unleaded gasoline
428359 ethanol is produced by bacteria that ferment and break down carbohydrate sugars such as the starch from corn humans have been fine tuning this process for although mainly to brew alcoholic beverages
428360 situations involving plugged fuel filters are virtually non existent today in the past especially in cars made prior to 1975 switching to ethanol blended gasoline occasionally resulted in the fuel system being scrubbed clean due to the cleansing nature of ethanol the loosened residue would be caught in the fuel filter requiring a filter change once the filter was changed the fuel system remained clean enhancing engine performance some components in gasoline such as olefins which are a waxy substance can cause deposits that foul injectors but since ethanol burns 100 percent and leaves no residue it cannot contribute to the formation of deposits in fact ethanol blends help keep fuel injectors cleaner

428494 we do not have any reason to believe that life exists on that planet
428495 we can only say that we have the temperature to permit the development of life i would say its one very interesting step in a long process going in the direction to having some major discovery related to life in the universe
428496 this seems to be the first discovery of an earth like planet
428497 its not exactly an earth but its close enough that i think it does deserve the title of perhaps the first earth like planet

428544 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
428545 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
428546 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
428547 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
428548 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

428556 its two weeks since i got injured but ive been working hard every day
428557 i did a lot of running last week and my fitness levels are back to where they were before my injury
428558 the pain is going away so it should be fine i twisted my knee and it was my medial ligaments although i did wonder if it might be more serious i now hope to train next week
428559 when it happened i was worried it might be worse than it is its serious enough for me but my knee is healing well and luckily i came back with good fitness levels so that should help
428560 hopefully i will soon be kicking the ball without any problems

428570 it took us some time to find out what happened simply because just after the german race we were not finding anything exceptional with that car at the moment of the failure
428571 we were just finding a load case which was not explaining the failure it took us a long time to find the life of this part and what went wrong we found the cause was in the silverstone race where this rear right suspension corner has seen some outstanding loads
428572 we have obviously a screening procedure to handle parts which may have been damaged by an incident
428573 actually we had detected a problem with the push rod but in a race we run a reduced number of sensors and we had not been able to re estimate the loading of the suspension parts

428585 two years and then i will return to the czech republic you have to understand i cannot play anymore in the nhl anymore you are so much better than me what can i do in a league when ovechkin gets 65 goals and i only can get 25 i was so bad so like a real man i couldnt not leave
428586 if you had hit only 40 goals and i 30 then i might have thought about staying for one more year but now i understand that there is nothing left for me to attain in the nhl ovechkin is there
428587 have you ever been received as warmly as you were today in omsk perhaps in prague after the gold medal in nagano in 98
428588 i was very warmly seen off from new york he laughs they waved actively like this go away they said go away from here

428629 in 1944 when the time came to infuse some life into the struggle to face a brutal regime you played a key role in the formation of the anc youth league
428630 you did the same in 1949 when militancy was required during the defiance campaign you led from the front as you wanted an end to racial domination and hatred
428631 the m plan should serve as an inspiration for anc branches currently we are encouraging them to establish street committees to fight crime in our communities
428632 as the struggle continued waged internally and internationally you represented the undying spirit of a people who would never rest until justice and human dignity were restored the mandela name became synonymous with our struggle for freedom
428633 during your term as the first president of a free south africa you elevated this country from being a pariah to a respected successful modern democracy you served a very short but highly effective term before handing over to your deputy comrade mbeki in a carefully planned succession strategy

428650 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
428651 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
428652 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
428653 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

428656 these females will go on to win more frequently in later interactions and grow more dominant
428657 in groups with more males males are more often defeated by other males consequently high ranking females may be victorious over these losers
428658 also in fiercer cultures we might expect more dominance of women
428659 those are words that ring in the american national anthem on american licence plates in the american declaration of independence
428660 we have let down the constitution the constitution hasnt let us down we have not used our constitutional rights to our advantage we have not seriously tried to avail our legal entitlements
428661 religious education is a must but secular education is equally a must there can be no bigger social service than educating the community
428662 educating our female lot is more important an educated mother means an educated family we must concentrate on educating our community particularly women
428663 instead of depending upon others the community must come forward and do the needful to educate people and help the needy weaker sections need to be helped out
428664 weve helped set up this conference to address the need for continued education in the health industry of al anbar
428665 i would like to see this continue with even more cooperation with american and european hospitals
428666 its a magnificent structure built by local iraqis who tell me theyre very proud to be part of this effort said keith addams gulf region div
428667 as the rule of law reduces the power of selfish men the economical and agricultural capacities of iraq will blossom
428668 i honestly believe that all this and so much more is possible through creating enforcing and obeying fair and just law
428669 its a critical step in helping make iraq a safer place for all who want peace and justice
428670 this building will help the teachers in ramadi become even better at their jobs
428671 its a place where all of the teachers can come for special activities and meetings
428672 this building will put the teachers in the perfect position to be creative in their ways of teaching the students and become better more advanced instructors
428673 when i first arrived one of the lieutenants that worked here told me about the program detainee work program so i spoke to my cmdr and based on my experience i was selected to work on the detainee work program
428674 i am glad to pass on some of the knowledge that i have from my civilian experience to the detainees as well as to the soldiers hopefully this will give them some basic skills to build upon so that when they are released they can contribute to the future of iraq
428675 when i saw the large cement pad within the family visitation area i thought that would be a great place for a gazebo
428676 i also thought that when detainees had their family visitation time they could show off their new skills and take pride in building this structure
428677 its actually been quite rewarding to be in my position said monroe i get to see the final product i have tangible evidence of their learning you can see the pride in their faces because they made it tables benches gazebo and now they get to use it they also get to show off their new skills to their families
428678 he continued to live the lifestyle of a grad student no frills
428679 were looking at a man with a distinguished 30 something year career unparalleled and known around the world
428680 his career and his reputation are trashed and the fbi still hasnt said what they have on him
428681 we are saddened by his death and disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
428682 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation in dr ivins case it led to his untimely death
428683 we knew they were looking at someone we knew that bruce worked at fort detrick we knew he worked with pathogens
428684 its not like you might say the person gave off vibes that they might be a dangerous person
428685 a serious offence and it should be treated with the seriousness it deserves
428686 recent escalation in offences of this kind and the importance for the time being of courts focussing on the purposes of sentencing of reduction of crime including its reduction by deterrence and the protection of the public
428687 we are not fighting for slavery we are fighting for independence
428688 when i looked out in the morning i could not help being struck by an odd and not pleasant coincidence
428689 we came out of prison just as we had gone in holding the same just scorn and detestation for the despotism under which the country was prostrate and with a stronger resolution that ever to oppose it by every means to which as american freemen we had the right to resort

428692 wie wir mit resident evil 4 wii gezeigt haben gibt es nach wie vor einen markt f r erwachsene titel auch auf diesen plattformen
428693 es gibt keinen grund warum ein angemessener titel f r erwachsene nicht produziert werden sollte was ich sehe ist dass publisher sich von titeln wegbewegen die ausschlie lich erwachsene themen behandeln und die lediglich schockieren wollen

428701 we are in detailed discussions with hal to further our relationship and have a bigger role in india in the future
428702 we will be exporting our motorcycles and scooters to sri lanka shortly

428706 we do not want to disclose it now but we have plans
428707 we have targetted to sell 80 000 units of cbf stunner and the total vehicles of 10 lakh units this fiscal
428708 the idea that we can continue to grow briskly with the fewcountries that are ticking along is unrealistic in light of thenumerous countries that are no longer ticking along
428709 for years we had double digit growth rates in exports nowwe are heading towards zero
428710 the downturn will last longer and hit harder than companieshave so far assumed
428711 on the labour market therewill be bad news during the whole of 2009

428727 el acuerdo con los organizadores chinos brinda la posibilidad a los periodistas de hacer libremente reportajes sobre los juegos los chinos fueron incluso m s lejos al autorizarlos a realizar reportajes sobre temas generales
428728 pero ellos siempre emitieron reservas sobre lo que constituye un peligro para la seguridad nacional tienen derecho a hacerlo

428745 at first there were just a few flames coming out from the side but within minutes of us being here the whole lot just went up and the whole building was on fire
428746 there was a huge explosion and then a tremendous tornado of flames we heard all the glass breaking and people rushing out from the building screaming
428747 this was a 100ft high uncompartmented building therefore there were no barriers to stop the fire spreading
428748 it would also appear at this stage that the building material assisted in the spread of the fire
428749 i did not hear an explosion just the crash of the masonry falling and the sound of breaking glass as the ticket window disintegrated
428750 there was blood all over me everyone was running shouting and screaming
428751 people were coming out of the station with blood streaming from their wounds
428752 one middle aged man was carried to an ambulance with blood pouring from a severed leg
428753 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
428754 there is nothing on the record to indicate obama ever withdrew his support from odinga
428755 even after odinga signed the agreement with the muslims in kenya
428756 appears even today to be a direct and active supporter of odinga as odinga himself frequently boasts

428769 in the images i have shown people in their own homes and environments wearing costumes that they would be dressed in to attend events with other like minded individuals the work hints at the depth of peoples fantasies and the methods they employ to adopt this culture as part of their own lifestyle as a means of escapism

428784 with worms theyre kind of mushy but if you put them over a rock on a nice sunny day they dry out and theyll actually almost be like a jerky
428785 worms are one of the highest sources of protein along with ants ants pound for pound have more than most food sources you can find
428786 if you take those and put them right up to your lips if its tingling or it has a bitter taste to it 90 per cent of the time it could be poisonous
428787 if youre in an extreme situation for survival youre better off drinking water even if it potentially might have some parasites in it
428788 less than one per cent of the people i ever send out on a canoe trip in algonquin park even see a bear so if you do see a bear first enjoy the experience bears are really fascinating creatures

428805 our fine arts were developed their types and uses were established in times very different from the present by men whose power of action upon things was insignificant in comparison with ours but the amazing growth of our techniques the adaptability and precision they have attained the ideas and habits they are creating make it a certainty that profound changes are impending in the ancient craft of the beautiful in all the arts there is a physical component which can no longer be considered or treated as it used to be which cannot remain unaffected by our modern knowledge and power for the last twenty years neither matter nor space nor time has been what it was from time immemorial we must expect great innovations to transform the entire technique of the arts thereby affecting artistic invention itself and perhaps even bringing about an amazing change in our very notion of art

428808 here by a remarkable regression we have come back to the level of expression of the egyptians pictorial language has not yet matured because our eyes have not yet adjusted to it there is as yet insufficient respect for insufficient cult of what it expresses
428809 what art has been granted a dream more poetical and more real at the same time approached in this fashion the film might represent an incomparable means of expression only the most high minded persons in the most perfect and mysterious moments of their lives should be allowed to enter its ambience
428810 do not all the bold descriptions we have given amount to the definition of prayer
428811 the film has not yet realized its true meaning its real possibilities these consist in its unique faculty to express by natural means and with incomparable persuasiveness all that is fairylike marvelous supernatural
428812 feels as if in exile exiled not only from the stage but also from himself with a vague sense of discomfort he feels inexplicable emptiness his body loses its corporeality it evaporates it is deprived of reality life voice and the noises caused by his moving about in order to be changed into a mute image flickering an instant on the screen then vanishing into silence the projector will play with his shadow before the public and he himself must be content to play before the camera
428813 the greatest effects are almost always obtained by acting as little as possible
428814 the latest trend in treating the actor as a stage prop chosen for its characteristics and inserted at the proper place
428815 which far from looking like retarded rapid movements give the effect of singularly gliding floating supernatural motions
428816 i can no longer think what i want to think my thoughts have been replaced by moving images

428818 for twenty seven years we futurists have rebelled against the branding of war as anti aesthetic accordingly we state war is beautiful because it establishes mans dominion over the subjugated machinery by means of gas masks terrifying megaphones flame throwers and small tanks war is beautiful because it initiates the dreamt of metalization of the human body war is beautiful because it enriches a flowering meadow with the fiery orchids of machine guns war is beautiful because it combines the gunfire the cannonades the cease fire the scents and the stench of putrefaction into a symphony war is beautiful because it creates new architecture like that of the big tanks the geometrical formation flights the smoke spirals from burning villages and many others poets and artists of futurism remember these principles of an aesthetics of war so that your struggle for a new literature and a new graphic art may be illumined by them

428830 you are awful quiet talk to me while i drive
428831 youll see im going to take of the world of computers ill show them
428832 live your life how you want to not how others want you to
428833 i found that humorous not because im laughing at you but im laughing at the fact that you used downward sprial
428834 youre afraid of stalkers and abuse which i understand and agree with but what i was trying to say is that we like it so much because we are kids
428835 you can leave little comments to friends whenever and just keep in touch i find that most people are more open on the internet then in person or on the phone this is good and bad the social barrier that stops some people from talking much at school is often broken because of a website inbetween them
428836 you can learn a ton about your friends that social mask that we all were can be thrown aside and you can be who you really are so as kids get more into it they like it more and more
428837 we can study vietnam and world war ii but we dont know what it was really like unless we could live the moment again
428838 however what i will argue is the relationship between myspace and assualt stalk killed ect ect compared to the rest of daily activities teens do
428839 when you walk down the street you could get raped ran over killed the whole works
428840 myspace might make it easier for stalkers to find a target but getting to is a different story you give out what city and state you live in and your age and sometimes name ive yet to see a place where you can fill in for street address and house number so far a stalker knows what city you live in and how old you are and what you look like thats it
428841 most users have a thing to where if you arent friends with them then you cant see there profile or anything
428842 even if they did what else is there to do you can message them i suppose and try and become friends with them and then set up a date but thats work
428843 same as if a guy was to sit on a route that school children take home
428844 he could follow them home and get the street address a lot easier than on myspace the feel the risks are the same as if you were to walk home from school
428845 yes i am a target i am a target just as well as anyone else is does being on myspace really increase my chance for being a target
428846 the stalker could browse for teen girls add them all and come back the next day with maybe a few approves and a ton of denied whats the chances that the few people that did approve actually live where he does
428847 lets say the stalker travels okay he travels to st louis now what he looks for a 18 year old teen girl that looks like someone good luck with that hes better off jsut finding someone walking on the street
428848 what youre experiencing is the result of the filter engine searching text or images on the requested website and finding things that fall into pre programmed algorithms exactly pre programmed algorithms history classes anatomy and modern social issues are a few classes that come to mind that make it very difficult to have research projects on topics like world war ii genocide sexually transmitted diseases body parts for anatomy and things like that are all blocked
428849 i know what youre going to say use the library they have filters too
428850 i guess what im saying is that not every site thats blocked is porn myspace facebook and things like that but needed sites for research
428851 there are hundreds of sites out there for aids not everyone is blocked but the ones that have valid information are usually because of the word sexual or and image
428852 however i still argue the fact that its a few peoples opinions to block certain sites
428853 its kind of like our electoral college i think its flawed
428854 and yes most proxy are the same scripts and i assume that your engines block that script and all that who ha theres a will theres a way we will always give you guys a run for your money you wont ever have everyone of them because it would be an impossibility you can get dam close and you guys are doing a good job of it but we still find ways around things like i said a circle
428855 i will say this most of the time parents know alot more than we think and no its never going to happen kids speak up kids fight back
428856 my main arguement is the validaty of saying that myspace xanga facebook actually increases the chances of someone to get raped killed whatever if a stranger asks you where you live and you actually give it to them then whats to say they wouldnt if a guy in a car pulled up and offered a ride if that kid is stupid enough to give it away on myspace then they are on the streets
428857 its english made for kids and they like it a lot
428858 p s i read 3 4 websites that you posted about myspace
428859 i read an interesting quote on one of thsoe sites
428860 my point is this maybe the focus is on the wrong thing
428861 dont talk to strangers dont give out your address to strangers blah blah
428862 stop smoking drinking dont do drugs say no dont have sex wait till your older
428863 be safe use a condem always have a designated driver or something
428864 when you tell kids not to do things they want to do it more
428865 what youre experiencing is the result of the filter engine searching text or images on the requested website and finding things that fall into pre programmed algorithms
428866 agreed heart of the problem children need to listen to their parents teachers administrators never going to happen right try to make it happen maybe you should listen to people who have been alive longer than you
428867 whats ironic is that they do it in order to minimize the
428868 it would be far more reasonable for the district to give time limits or something to students that access the sites but not block them out completely
428869 it is absolutely moronic that they believe that by sheltering us from certain websites they are
428870 i see how adults dont understand why we use it anyway they dont use it so they cant understand it
428871 you want us to turn our eyes away from places like myspace facebook xanga ect ect so we can focus more on learning at school am i right if im not please correct me
428872 who says you cant blog on someone from another state or another country for that matter whats wrong with finding out what some other teen from japan is thinking
428873 what is sad is that people like you no offense harvest urls and deem it
428874 p s we can make them a hell of a lot faster then you can find them i assure you
428875 p s s someone did say this is an on going circle how right they are we make sites you block em we make new sites you block em its kind of like beating around the bush isnt it why not get to the heart of the problem and solve it
428876 its spelt wisdom kinda ruins your attempt at being better than everyone else when your key word is spelt incorrectly oh dear and this isnt because im trying to access myspace at school or i dont agree with you i couldnt give a crap about myspace its because you sound like a moron
428877 i worry about my child and the internet all the time even though shes too young to have logged on yet
428878 hmm well lets try that im grounded at home i cant leave nor talk on the phone untill the school year is over my parents both work for the state of michigan at a juvienille disiplinary center aka im f ed you a hole
428879 obviously you dont understand the addiction to these websites and untill you do you can take your self centeredness and shove it
428880 im so sick of people like you who dont even try to think of
428881 man id have done that differently if i only knew
428882 yeah im female have a problem with that you shovinistic prick

428908 this is great if the context of the blog post suits the need of your situation but what if it doesnt is the arguement that blogs are not trying to be what they cant be vs codified documents that have an intention they cannot meet they are not achieving what they are intending to achieve so nothing can have a constant context blog post or not
428909 i can send back an email in a couple of seconds to someone with whom i share a certain context i can leave out all the details when i reply to him her but when i want to answer him her via my blog i also have to think about all the other people that dont share that context because they dont theyll be frustrated when they read my post writing such a post instead of an email would take more of my time or am i missing something
428910 can you just move an email conversation to a blog without providing more context to other readers

428999 dont push me ill pull you instead and if you push too hard ill pull away
429000 until 5 1 i was doing quite well i was feeling good and hitting the ball well
429001 all of a sudden i got exhausted completely lost my concentration it was hard for me the rest of the match to keep up because the points were quite long the longer they went i felt worse and worse i just couldnt do it
429002 i didnt start very well i was quite nervous and was making a lot of mistakes
429003 but i knew if i started playing my game and started stepping into the court and moving her more i could come back so i was just believing in myself and playing point by point she gave me some chances and i took them
429004 i dont really think about no 1 if its going to happen it will happen but at the moment i dont deserve that spot im not in the best shape and im not at my highest level it will take time for me to get better and better
429005 i think in the first set she was just playing very good tennis i havent spoken with my coaches to see if they think i was doing something wrong
429006 but then she gave some free points that helped me come back after that the match started to be close i would say today the luck was on my side
429007 i took them for the training programme to improve their living conditions but never imagined that this tragedy was waiting to happen

429018 orders you giving me orders amigo the only thing in this world that gives orders is balls you got that
429019 all i have in this world is my balls and my word and i dont break them for no one
429020 in this country you gotta make the money first then when you get the money you get the power then when you get the power then you get the woman thats why you gotta make your own moves
429021 i want whats coming to me the world chico and everything in it
429022 we gonna war thats what we gonna do we gonna eat that sosa for breakfast close that fucker down
429023 you tell your guy in miami your friend itd be a pleasure i kill a communist for fun but for a greencard im gonna carve him up real nice
429024 i know a lot of guys from boston and i dont have any particular fondness for them
429025 i have a fondness for this guy because he wants to get in there and kick your butt hes vicious hes relentless he goes in there to stop guys hes not just fooling around looking to get a check hes going in there to beat the expletive out of you and finish the fight if i have a fondness for him thats why not because hes from boston
429026 the list is long and the line is long and there are a lot of guys out there quality guys who have earned shots
429027 guys have to take a number kenny took his number and got his shot and he came up a little short its time for other guys to get their chance you have to think of the sport and the fans dont want to see the same three four guys always fighting for the title
429028 nobody wanted a kenny florian sean sherk rematch right after that fight
429029 it makes sense to us to go out and fight all the best and beat all the best and then go ahead and fight for the title it doesnt seem right to take one guy out and then get that immediate title shot
429030 i consider roger at the top of the weight class
429031 hes just been tearing through competitors in my opinion this was the best fight that could be put together in this division and im in the ufc to fight the best
429032 he was awesome if i didnt know better i would have thought he had years of experience doing it the hardest part of that is not stepping all over each other and making your points quickly he was so well spoken and he made excellent points and had good timing hell do that again someday im sure
429033 roger is a great fighter and hes a worthy guy but i dont believe hes on the level of a kenny florian
429034 im not sure roger could go five rounds with someone like sean sherk kenny has fought bigger and badder guys and i think that will show on aug 9
429035 roger has a great story and he has his struggle and people can relate to that he was a little kid selling gum on the streets of mexico to help his family kenny comes from a great family from dover and people go come on how can this guy be a fighter but hes a true warrior
429036 the thing i like about kenny is that he knows the way of the samurai
429037 when the samurai fights hes not emotional its an emotionless thing he doesnt use things someone else did to motivate him hes calm and cool and collected when he fights thats kenny too i really believe in this fight that kenny florian is going to be the matador and roger will be the raging bull hes upset at life and with the cards hes been dealt but kenny knows who he is and where he is and what he needs to do to get better he doesnt get emotional about it and i think that gives him an edge when he goes out to do his job
429038 the commissions action marks a significant milestone demonstrating our companys commitment to invest in renewables projects

429046 dealing with the press is something that youve gotta start getting used to
429047 and you know people want something to talk about so theyre going to have the two disney girls or three disney girls kind of feuding
429048 theres no feud theres nothing to feud about so why start a fight
429049 its something that we all have to live with and unfortunately it involves friends
429050 im not interested in being anybody but myself and im not here to replace anyone
429051 i think that shes a wonderful performer and of course its a compliment but i would like to take a different route
429052 i would love to step out of disney and maybe do a couple of roles maybe challenging roles and fun roles new things like that
429053 its instantly putting you in the position of being a foreigner an outsider and a sexual stereotype its an all in one combo
429054 asian women get exotified and hyper sexualized to the point where it really affects our day to day life
429055 a lot of times when people use phrases like that they neglect the background
429056 like sex trafficking so if a guy goes up to someone in a bar and hes using that phrase and hes imagining that scene for some reason im sure they mean it as a fun thing i dont think they mean it to be malicious they know shes not a prostitute but its attached to that its a lot more than a simple phrase
429057 and then i was watching full metal jacket and im going ohhhhhh thats where 2 live crew got it ok but back in the day everybody would be saying that
429058 love you long time comes out of a fairly stereotypical situation and its recycled itself back into the culture
429059 now its being used as an empowerment phrase like to deny it i wont love you long time or women who take the phrase and use it to assert themselves
429060 it came from this cool dark powerful place which all women possess i guess i just took that and ran with it because that phrase just came to mind love you long time it just seemed powerful for a woman to possess that much energy all she has to say is four little words and shes got everybody eating out of the palm of her hand
429061 bitch she started saying shes a bitch im a bitch and she owned the word women should be grateful to her for that shes a modern day feminist

429095 como j tive oportunidade de notar este tratado n o se limita a simplificar as regras de funcionamento da ue mas
429096 a europa n o pode degenerar numa esp cie de despotismo iluminado imposto aos povos por via burocr tica socapa quase s escondidas e a irlanda n o pode ser encarada como uma na o mal comportada que preciso castigar por ter cometido a heresia de dar a palavra ao povo
429097 porque n o h europa sem respeito pela diferen a n o h europa sem democracia
429098 do meu ponto de vista a conclus o pol tica apenas uma ficar se a dever a um governo e maioria do ps e n o esquerda conservadora o maior avan o da legisla o laboral contra a precariedade
429099 no debate h dois campos o campo que defende a concerta o social e o campo que a combate
429100 o pcp critica com grande azedume as propostas de revis o do c digo de trabalho mas ao faz lo est a desprezar os interesses dos trabalhadores essa tamb m a verdade deste debate o pcp sacrifica sua t ctica pol tica os interesses da larga maioria dos trabalhadores
429101 adaptabilidade na vida das empresas com melhores condi es de adapta o ao mercado
429102 com a possibilidade acordarem com os seus trabalhadores a gest o do tempo de trabalho as empresas ficam mais competitivas
429103 as propostas do governo obedecem mesma preocupa o favorecer a moderniza o das empresas porque isso essencial para que cres am a economia e emprego proteger os trabalhadores porque isso essencial para o aumento do bem estar de todos e o combate precariedade e exclus o
429104 aos arautos da desgra a aos advers rios da autonomia do movimento sindical aos inimigos do di logo social e da moderniza o econ mica o governo do ps diz que esse n o o caminho
429105 progressistas rigorosas no combate precariedade amigas da negocia o colectiva e capazes de um equil brio positivo entre as necessidades de adapta o das empresas e os direitos dos trabalhadores
429106 pode haver muitos motivos para censurar o governo mas este o motivo errado
429107 o senhor deputado disse que h motivos de sobra para censurar este governo mas estes s o os motivos errados
429108 se h um ponto de diverg ncia porque s o mais ambiciosas
429109 o ps n o recupera uma proposta dessa discuss o porqu essa mudan a de atitude
429110 t m medo dos trabalhadores e da concerta o social
429111 o prop sito da adse dar a todos os funcion rios p blicos um maior leque de op es
429112 uma ac o pol tica evidente em viola o do regulamento sobre seguran a nos eventos organizados pela len
429113 e se esta gente n o andasse na pol tica apenas por interesses e ao servi o de uns quantos depois de ter escomoteado deliberadamente o direito democr tico aos cidad os de decidir sobre o seu futuro tentando trapass los com uma burla a que chamaram pomposamente
429114 as mexidas no c digo laboral v o mexer com a vida de milh es de trabalhadores
429115 se n o transmitisse as minhas opini es n o era em termos intlectuais s rio
429116 ent o se tu reconheces que assim tamb m tens de reconhecer que s mudando a rigidez da nossa legisla o possivel alterar isto e a altera o do c digo de trabalho pode ser uma grande ajuda ou n o assim
429117 considerando que s se pode fundar uma paz universal e duradoura com base na justi a social
429118 quando os trabalhadores e o povo perceberem e tiverem a coragem de assumir isto como uma tarefa inevit vel para a transforma o do mundo e para uma vida digna quando os trabalhadores e o povo perceberem que s atrav s da luta esse objectivo poder ser alcan ado ent o estar o abertas as portas para um mundo melhor

429121 chairs and tables arranged for patrons to observe the stage presentations
429122 dance and nudity are forms of art and expression that are entitled to some measure of first amendment protection
429123 imagine it has taken almost fifty years for america to catch up with the rest of the world in how the female form is viewed as art and not pornography in europe and japan the female body has been viewed in the way nude portrays it for decades and now finally in america we have a publication that breaks new ground for artistic freedom my grandfather the legendary photographer edward weston had spent his last years attempting but with no success to publish his work in a format similar to carrie leighs nude
429124 ironically it took decades for edwards work to be published by the getty museum and now we have a quarterly fine art magazine that exhibits the finest fine art photographers
429125 i think the nudity just raises it the possibility to another level the cliffs are a national landmark i just dont think theres any need of nude sunbathing

429167 the ad features a man whose appearance and actions speedwalking in an exaggerated manner conjure up stereotypes of gay men

429169 anecdotal evidence suggests that the snickers ad was really well liked by its target market and that most sane people wouldnt have been offended but we are living in a climate where the slightest hint of anyone being offended and the kneejerk response is just to pull it this will probably cause more controversy in the end and it seems a pity that they couldnt have the courage of their convictions and just ride out the storm

429294 ayer la vi por primera vez la tenian vac a los ni os y no tan ni os estaban con sus bicicletas y con sus patines haciendo skateboard dentro de la plaza lo cual me parece lamentable tanto por parte de los padres que se lo permiten como por parte de las autoridades que lo permiten no olviden que se ha construido con dinero p blico es decir de todos por otra parte es tan grande que desde mi punto de vista falta espacio me explico yo tengo un beb para pasar mi carrito para dirigirme hasta la entrada del cabildo he tenido que invadir la calzada donde no paraban de pasar coches ya que junto a la fuentita han construido unos mamotretos que quitan la vista de la plaza e invaden un espacio precioso para pasear la plaza de espa a siempre ha sido un espacio abierto y ahora es cerrado y estrecho cero para los pol tcos que nos han quitado un pulmoncito que tiene esta ciudad que quieren cambiar a golpe de caprichos

429298 could it ever be hazardous and self defeating to try to avoid war
429299 well certainly there was bad juju going down at enron
429300 well like any other country with a history the united states has some moments where its a little tough to be proud
429301 well okay but you asked what my opinion was and that piece of evidence is good enough for me
429302 acknowledges that while the golden dawns sources may be more than a little off it remains an established workable system
429303 the first in a series of occasional articles exploring alternative cultural life around southern california
429304 feeling crafty check out this piece posted in 2006 on the chaos rosary
429305 frank you know all about gardens and nature what in the world is going on down there in the midwest what happened to the dandelions violets thistle and stuff i started eons ago i had a perfect no maintenance garden plan those plants grow in any type of soil withstand drought and multiply with abandon the nectar from the long lasting blossoms attracted butterflies honey bees and flocks of songbirds i expected to see a vast garden of colors by now but all i see are these green rectangles
429306 its the tribes that settled there lord the suburbanites they started calling your flowers weeds and went to great extent to kill them and replace them with grass
429307 grass but its so boring its not colorful it doesnt attract butterflies birds and bees only grubs and sod worms its temperamental with temperatures do these suburbanites really want all that grass growing there
429308 apparently so lord they go to great pains to grow it and keep it green they begin each spring by fertilizing grass and poisoning any other plant that crops up in the lawn
429309 the spring rains and cool weather probably make grass grow really fast that must make the suburbanites happy
429310 apparently not lord as soon as it grows a little they cut it sometimes twice a week
429311 they cut it do they then bale it like hay
429312 not exactly lord most of them rake it up and put it in bags
429313 they bag it why is it a cash crop do they sell it
429314 no sir just the opposite they pay to throw it away
429315 now let me get this straight they fertilize grass so it will grow and when it does grow they cut it off and pay to throw it away
429316 these suburbanites must be relieved in the summer when we cut back on the rain and turn up the heat that surely slows the growth and saves them a lot of work
429317 you arent going believe this lord when the grass stops growing so fast they drag out hoses and pay more money to water it so they can continue to mow it and pay to get rid of it
429318 what nonsense at least they kept some of the trees that was a sheer stroke of genius if i do say so myself the trees grow leaves in the spring to provide beauty and shade in the summer in the autumn they fall to the ground and form a natural blanket to keep moisture in the soil and protect the trees and bushes plus as they rot the leaves form compost to enhance the soil its a natural circle of life
429319 you better sit down lord the suburbanites have drawn a new circle as soon as the leaves fall they rake them into great piles and have them hauled away
429320 no what do they do to protect the shrub and tree roots in the winter and keep the soil moist and loose
429321 after throwing away your leaves they go out and buy something they call mulch they haul it home and spread it around in place of the leaves
429322 enough i dont want to think about this anymore saint catherine youre in charge of the arts what movie have you scheduled for us tonight

429339 the secret of this kind of climbing is like zen dont think just dance along its the easiest thing in the world actually easier than walking on flat ground which is monotonous the cute little problems present themselves at each step and you find yourself on some other boulder you picked out for no special reason at all just like zen
429340 when you get to the top of a mountain keep climbing
429341 its pretty common to hear bad excuses from staffers outside of the gps fort
429342 but to hear so many from the inside well its just changed my whole perspective on the goals of this administration i feel like were just giving lip service to the mountain at this point
429343 it is clear they need to be either tricked taunted or otherwise harassed into climbing this mountain
429344 he came across a naked female on the trail and at 14 degrees he thought that was an issue
429345 he will need regular medical supervision until his doctors clear him to return to work
429346 his doctors remain hopeful that he will fully recover but due to extensive surgery and the nature of the injuries there remains a substantial risk of both infection and other complications
429347 his two fingers are pretty smashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it into the story

429382 major labels arent doing well because they put out terrible records for years and years and kept raising the price of those terrible records and finally people were like screw you
429383 part of it is just being realistic and not putting yourself in the hole
429384 the bands we work with we never recommend that they make videos i like videos but they dont sell a lot of records what really sells records is touring and artists can actually make money on the tour itself if they keep their budgets down
429385 a lot of artists dont realize how much more money they could make by retaining ownership and licensing directly
429386 if its done properly you get paid quickly and you get paid again and again thats a great source of income

429416 ich mein ja nur weil der bohlen jetzt die werbung f r becel macht
429417 normalerweise sieht man in den spots doch immer wie alte menschen mit ihren enkeln spielen und wegen dem becel total fit sind weil ja der cholesterinspiegel so niedrig ist
429418 nun bohlen kam mir nie wirklich alt vor deshalb frag ich mich ob uns der spot entweder sagen will dass der bohlen alt ist oder dass auch j ngere menschen auf ihren cholesterinspiegel achten sollten
429419 der verdammte spot will dass du dir den m ll kaufst
429420 und jetzt sag mir ob der bohlen zwischen 18 und 19 ist
429421 dann ist mir der bohlen mit seinem cholesterinspiegel egal kannst mich in vierzig jahren ja nochmal fragen
429422 hmm im spot spielt bohlen nicht mit kindern sondern einem hund ob das wohl kritik an der niedrigen geburtsrate ist

429424 in line with the state responsibility in safeguarding lebanons sovereignty independence unity and territorial integrity in line with the constitution the government emphasizes on
429425 the right of lebanon its people army and resistance to liberate or recover the occupied shebaa farms kfarshouba hills and the lebanese sector of the ghajar village and defend lebanon against any aggression and adhere to its right in its waters by all legitimate and available means
429426 the government adheres to unscr 1701 and all its requirements
429427 proceeding to work out a comprehensive national strategy to protect lebanon and defend it to be agreed on during dialogue sponsored by the president of the republic with the participation of the arab league after the government wins a vote of confidence
429428 this right is to be practiced under the state wing

429434 serious enough for israeli defense minister ehud barak to repeat three times in as many days that the idf is keeping a close watch on events in the northern front especially the deepening ties between syria and the lebanese hizbullah
429435 takeover on behalf of tehran places israeli security at a grave disadvantage
429436 military movements carried out in the last two weeks by hizbullah can only be interpreted as preparations for war
429437 it will take time before lebanon can attract big arab investors again
429438 we dont have industry that can compete and we dont have agriculture we have services
429439 syrian positions in lebanon appear designed purely as a forward defensive line in the case of any israeli advance and not as conduits for weaponry smuggled from syria to hezbollah
429440 human intelligence verification of the increase in activity is impossible
429441 in late 2005 the lebanese armed forces sealed off the hills to the east of kfar qouk

429443 by radicalising people political factions can guarantee a larger base of supporters in the upcoming 2009 parliamentary elections salafists like many others are lured by false messiahs

429476 eso me hace sentir fuerza y que no estoy sola
429477 creo que a m tambi n me cancelar n la matr cula a fines de este a o
429478 creo que es puro show si a ella le interesa hablar conmigo quiere decir que le interesa la educaci n que est n teniendo los j venes sobre todo los que son pobres entonces que se preocupe por todos los ni os y j venes que pueden ser violentos o no como ministra de educaci n es lamentable que reci n ahora se sienta preocupada a pesar que personas adultas y estudiantes le han dicho lo que pensamos es lamentable que por un jarro de agua quiera hablar con una que hable con todos
429479 no era primera vez el seremi de educaci n invit a la aceus y los compa eros me invitaron a m cuando est bamos ah comenz la manifestaci n de los profesores eramos veinte estudiantes de la aceus dirigentes de universidades de liceos de colegios no sab amos que iban los profesores nos enteramos en el momento en que los vimos dentro de la sala nos miramos y dijimos hay que apa ar hay que ayudarlos acompa arlos no podemos dejarlos solos y empezamos a decir no a la lge
429480 nada la reuni n estaba empezando pero el programa se alaba que se iban a crear grupos de trabajo sobre identidad financiamiento carrera docente y se iba a conversar sobre todo eso pero en realidad no es un di logo iba a ser una conversaci n m s como quien conversa entre amigos no se iba a resolver nada porque el cuento ya lo tienen armado la lge la tienen lista y aprobada
429481 yo estaba s per tranquila dije ya cabros dejen que la ministra responda y que despu s hable la vocera de la aceus tranquilos tranquilos pero me di cuenta que en medio de esa situaci n ca tica no iba a pasar nada de eso porque la ministra se estaba yendo entonces dije voy a contarle lo que est pasando en mi liceo lo que pas conmigo me acerqu corriendo y le dije ministra sabe qu me golpearon me tomaron detenida cuatro veces mojada empapada llena de lacrim genas me han mantenido m s de trece horas en la comisar a a mis compa eros los han golpeado tienen cicatrices enormes tanto f sicas como sicol gicas est n en fiscal a militar por montajes y acusaciones absurdas yo los quiero libres no tiene sentido tener ni os detenidos le dije eso pensando creo que fui un poco fantasiosa que me iba a responder por ltimo con una de sus respuestas ir nicas o que me iba a decir este no es momento de conversar puede ser despu s no me dijo absolutamente nada ni siquiera me mir ordenaba sus papeles despu s dijo que no me hab a visto dudo de eso porque yo estaba al lado de ella y no es muy normal que una estudiante est al lado de una ministra me vio me escuch pero no me quiso prestar atenci n fue como hablarle a una pared me dio pena me sent frustrada no me pesc no le import nada encontr un jarro que estaba all y le lanc el agua fue un impulso
429482 un gran alivio as como cuando uno llora sent como que me hubiera escuchado no es lo mismo obvio pero sal muy tranquila
429483 no para nada eso no es violencia llorar no es violencia
429484 no soy una persona agresiva para nada y mi familia es lo m s pac fica que hay pero tengo ideas claras la m a fue una reacci n natural si a alguien le tiran tanta represi n todos los d as y si ella aparece en la tele diciendo ir nicamente que el movimiento estudiantil no es nada y que s lo est movilizada una m nima parte de los estudiantes a uno le empieza a dar impotencia hay cero respeto por el movimiento estudiantil cero respeto por los ni os en general cuando hablan las personas del gobierno a la gente la dejan con impotencia cuando dicen hay que apretar los dientes por ejemplo claro c mo a ellos les pagan el dentista por eso la gente explota de alguna manera
429485 el 2006 yo no participaba en la asamblea conoc a un poco de la loce pero como toda la gente nada m s el significado de la sigla quien la hab a hecho y m s o menos para qu era particip un par de veces en las marchas sin entender mucho s lo sab a que estaban protestando por algo que encontraban injusto yo dije bueno tendr a que estar toda la gente protestando contra lo que es injusto
429486 llegu hasta la mitad del a o es que all hab an violado a una ni ita en la biblioteca y la ni ita segu a en el colegio y el profesor que la viol tambi n nos pegaban con los libros en la cabeza nos insultaban a los ni os peruanos los discriminaban y a los gorditos tambi n profesores de historia les dec an peruanos ignorantes hab a matones al estilo de las pel culas de estados unidos que amenazaban a mi hermano chico con pegarle si no les daba el almuerzo
429487 alumna significa sin luz as que yo no soy alumna soy estudiante y no s si soy buena depende de cu l es el criterio si usted viera el libro de clases estoy con condicionalidad por llegar tarde a clases con eso me dicen que no soy buena estudiante aunque tenga 5 7 de promedio hasta el momento donde me va mejor es en biolog a pero no s si eso es ser buena estudiante
429488 al principio parec a un imposible cambiar la loce ahora dicen que es imposible crear algo que no sea la lge pero yo creo que en el movimiento se han aprendido muchas cosas y que cada d a est mejor en general los estudiantes los profesores los apoderados saben m s cada d a est n m s cultos

429757 to understand the peoples cultures and politics of the muslim world today especially the young people who are the majority of the citizens we need to follow the musicians and their fans as much as the mullahs and their followers
429758 their imagination and openness to the world and the courage of their convictions remind us that muslim and western cultures are more heterogeneous complex and ultimately alike than the peddlers of the clash of civilizations the war on terror and unending jihad would have us believe
429759 it might seem counterintuitive to americans whose images of islam and the contemporary muslim world come largely from fox or cnn but an eighteen year old from casablanca with spiked hair or a twenty year old from dubai wearing goth makeup is as representative of the world of islam today as the muslims who look and act the way we expect them to

429786 i understand those houses are in the middle of the desert and all these people want to do is have a good life for their families
429787 were visiting and talking to those people because its easy for those smugglers or insurgents to take advantage of them
429788 if the people help us stop the insurgency it will bring stability in the region and build infrastructure for the future
429789 we went from being a security force to being advisors to the isf and now its time to finish the job
429790 in the end it will bring peace to this nation

429806 no me dejaron hablar con un abogado en 24 horas no me dijeron de qu se me acusaba
429807 estoy presa por mi trabajo profesional como cineasta por la informaci n que manejo por interactuar con activistas mapuches que luchan por lo que creen por entrevistar a personas de comunidades mapuches que han sido muy reprimidas y que no se atreven a decir nada porque s muchas cosas tan crueles que me llegan a enfermar el pueblo mapuche ha sido humillado ha sido perseguido he visto tanta gente aplastada emocionalmente siqui tricamente tanta gente que no se atreve a hablar por eso estoy presa

429814 i cant say one way or the other because we are still in discussions with the government
429815 we really do need to run this year and were fighting for it
429816 if the dollars and cents dont make sense then we have to make some hard decisions about its future
429817 it is very difficult to produce an event of this standard on a bare budget were pretty much doing it voluntarily
429818 theres a lot of people working on it for nothing at the moment myself included and theres a point that charity and goodwill starts to wear thin
429819 it would be nice if we had the money to do it like some other events
429820 official research in 2004 showed only 860 interstate and overseas visitors attended the horse trials
429821 the state government provided a lifeline to the adelaide international horse trials in 2003 on the very clear understanding that it was a three year assistance package
429822 im committed now to family first for the rest of my life to building the party
429823 the value the convictions the ethics which family first espouse are very much in line with my own
429824 now that the minor parties have the balance of power in the senate the era of the major parties dictating terms is over people want a third force in politics
429825 i have a track record of getting things done knowing how to get things done comes from experience life experience working your way up
429826 they wanted this candidate mr briggs and they were going to manipulate the circumstances in order to achieve that
429827 the major parties these days think its all about them they just want an outlet for the party in the electorate they are not looking for a peoples representative
429828 had the members of the party been allowed to do their job properly and been allowed to properly consider all the candidates we would have got a different result
429829 no one associated with the liberal party has been happy with what happened these past two weeks
429830 im the absolute underdog this is a classic once in a lifetime opportunity labor is not running a candidate the libs have put in a staffer this is the time for real action and for once to consider the real needs and interests of the people
429831 this is an exciting time for our party to grow into the third force in politics
429832 now bob has joined the party our aim is to win the seat
429833 were not under any illusions its going to be difficult but not impossible
429834 at one stage i was thinking i hope that labor dont run because it would be good for me
429835 and if i dont run all ill be doing is allowing this guy jamie briggs who no one really knows to grab the seat and thats what i dont want to see

429842 we would like to see the implementation in letter and spirit of commitments made to bring to an end terrorist activities originating in pakistan
429843 india seeks to establish peaceful friendly and cooperative ties with pakistan we are committed to addressing all outstanding issues including the issue of jammu and kashmir through bilateral discussions the indian pm said
429844 however improvement in our relations requires an atmosphere that is free from terrorism
429845 the scourge of terrorism must be removed from our midst and criminals and terrorists must never go unpunished
429846 there is nothing india specific in the agreement whatever is written in the preamble is not part of the agreement the operational part has the model which was prepared for non nuclear states and is being applied to us
429847 we are now bound by the iaea safeguard agreement in perpetuity whether we get uranium or not whether we get the material or not we have lost all rights to prevent iaea inspections of our institutions for all times and it will always be in their hands
429848 the bjp has always said it wanted a strategic partnership with the us but not strategic subservience yesterdays agreement is a testimony of our strategic subservience
429849 there is anger among people over the death of two children in the town most people have kept their establishments closed following a call given by the gondwana republican party and the samajwadi party
429850 the hostel management says that the boys died because of a fall in the toilet but the people suspect some foul play we are however investigating the matter security all over the town mainly around the ashram and the hostel run by it has been beefed up to avoid any untoward incident
429851 only the parents and the guardians interested to see their children or who want to take them back are being allowed entry inside the premises no untoward incident has been reported since morning
429852 geez what do you make with knitting needles that big
429853 el avance de un proceso en condiciones tales que afectar a fatalmente las garant as constitucionales vinculadas con las formas del enjuiciamiento criminal por lo que a mi criterio resultar a tard o atender esos agravios en ocasi n del fallo final de la causa ya que aunque la sentencia fuese absolutoria el perjuicio que el apelante hubiera querido evitar ya se habr a soportado
429854 no concierta con el r gimen imperante el hecho de que un tema en el que se encuentre planteada una cuesti n federal no merezca por limitaciones de fuente local el conocimiento del rgano m ximo de una provincia y s que sea propio de la corte suprema de la naci n
429855 las provincias son libres para crear las instancias judiciales que estimen apropiadas pero no pueden vedar a ninguna de ellas y menos a las m s altas la aplicaci n preferente de la constituci n nacional
429856 el recurso extraordinario cuya denegaci n dio origen a esta queja no se dirige contra una sentencia definitiva o equiparable a tal
429857 wenn man damit symbolisieren will dass man ab 2009 zusammenarbeitet

429861 cabe recordar que dicha acusaci n corresponde a la formulada por el ex director de conadi jaime andrade qui n habr a concurrido a participar de una reuni n en la comunidad el d a 29 de agosto del 2006 informando posteriormente por medio de una conferencia de prensa que habr a sido objeto de agresiones por parte de nuestra gente
429862 son candidaturas que han contado con un gran respaldo de firmas patrocinadoras y eso nos tiene contentos en algunos casos la ley nos exig a reunir 70 firmas y se juntaron m s de 100 eso habla de un respaldo creciente
429863 penchuleo representa para nosotros un nuevo tipo de liderazgo es un joven mapuche de la zona que ha destacado como dirigente universitario y cuya elecci n como candidato fue producto de un proceso de primarias in dito entre las comunidades de la zona
429864 podemos hacer historia en lautaro existen all cerca de 300 comunidades y los avances que hemos logrado como partido nos tienen optimistas sabemos que tenemos que trabajar duro y el mandato que la gente a entregado a luis es competir para ganar
429865 el pe i mario es un lider tradicional respetado y querido por las comunidades en la zona de freire su trayectoria habla por l y estamos orgullosos de que nos represente en la contienda electoral de octubre
429866 ambas candidaturas se han formalizado bajo la modalidad de independientes y eso nos exige trabajar el doble
429867 lamentablemente el servel aun no nos autoriza iniciar la campa a de firmas para legalizarnos y esto nos ha perjudicado sin embargo estas municipales nos dar n la oportunidad de seguir socializando nuestra propuesta pol tica a nivel de base y preparando el terreno para cuando demos el vamos a la campa a que esperamos sea el segundo semestre
429868 lautaro y freire son comunas de alta poblaci n mapuche y donde est n las bases fundadoras del partido lo que esperamos con estas candidaturas es acrecentar adem s nuestra base de militantes y posicionar a wallmapuwen de cara a nuestra campa a de legalizaci n ambas comunas son emblem ticas para nosotros y esperamos que al igual como sucede hoy con luis penchuleo en lautaro sigan surgiendo desde las comunidades liderazgos j venes que refresquen la pol tica mapuche y constituyan un real aporte a nuestro pueblo

429883 las llamadas entidades del campo s lo pronuncian los dictados de los agronegocios su s mbolo actual es la soja transg nica que ha devastado bosques desalojado comunidades contaminado suelos y aumentado los precios de los alimentos en el mercado interno el avance del modelo sojero iniciado durante el menemismo y acentuado en esta d cada significa un desierto verde y contaminado sin agricultores y ciudades saturadas de familias expulsadas de las zonas rurales
429884 el gobierno provincial alienta cuatro polos productivos la industria del az car y el tabaco el turismo y la miner a todas ellas atentan contra nuestros territorios y nuestra forma de vida
429885 repudiamos las pol ticas de exclusi n y saqueo de los territorios en que vivimos pol ticas promovidas por los grupos econ micos que tienen como c mplices a los gobiernos de turno
429886 el campo profundo reclama tierra que no se destruya m s el medio ambiente agua y reclama pol ticas para frenar el xodo hacia las ciudades y todo esto no depende de las retenciones depende de pol ticas reales que ning n gobierno impulsa
429887 la faa no dice que sus afiliados con la complicidad del sistema pol tico y jur dico desalojan campesinos y sinceremos que esos productores no cosechan alimentos en beneficio del pueblo producen forrajes para la especulaci n en el mercado externo

429920 once it finds the content it documents everything that a lawyer needs to prove that the thief was in fact using stolen content
429921 the big problem i see right now is not outsiders doing this rather it is people who purport to be contributing members in our industry
429922 this means when we come for you we know how to get you to the thieves that laugh about this remember that we are coordinated we are your affiliates we are the guys you sit next to at industry dinners and the people that bump your posts on boards hiding is hard to do when we know what you look like bro

429962 we will use the strong headwinds as an opportunity for change and continue the process of renovating and optimising our business in conjunction with strategy number one we must and we will intensify our efforts on both the cost and revenues side even further
429963 we assume that 2009 will be another difficult year full of challenges
429964 the increasing challenges clearly show that our strategy number one which we continue to implement rigorously is an essential part of the process to safeguard the bmw groups future and increase its value
429965 we have therefore decided to construct a vehicle equipped with an electro engine
429966 the current situation does not only represent a challenge we see it primarily as an opportunity for the bmw group the measures we are implementing are aimed at a significantly more demanding environment than one to two years ago our company will become even more efficient and we will continue to invest in our future

429971 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
429972 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
429973 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
429974 detected an apparent anthrax leak in december 2001 at the height of the anthrax mailings investigation but did not report it
429975 the political and journalistic establishment suddenly seems united in wanting to attack iraq
429976 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
429977 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
429978 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab

429983 while adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media are rare they are encountered regularly by all physicians who administer contrast material to patients and some of these reactions will require treatment
429984 we reviewed our experience to determine how often we encountered these reactions in our practice and how often the reactions required treatment we also wanted to know what happened to those patients who required treatment particularly when they had reactions that were moderate or severe
429985 commonly used medications can be administered safely however treatment errors are not uncommon and in a few instances can lead to patient morbidity
429986 in our study we found a number of instances in which non recommended treatment was provided these cases included the administration of oxygen by nasal cannula rather than mask and at lower than recommended doses over utilization of diphenhydramine including to a few patients who were hypotensive and the administration of higher than recommended doses of epinephrine as well as occasional confusion about which concentrations of epinephrine should be injected in which manner subcutaneously or intravenously in our study the most striking example of patient morbidity from non recommended treatment occurred in the two patients who received doses of 1 mg of epinephrine in the absence of cardiopulmonary arrest who both had cardiac complications fortunately these complications were mild and transient and caused no serious morbidity
429987 we hope that after reading our study radiologists nurses and technologists will agree that they must review the algorithms for treating contrast reactions on a regular basis particularly issues related to diphenhydramine oxygen and epinephrine administration
429988 in fact we would suggest that such a review should probably occur at least twice a year however it is also consoling to know that even when patients have moderate or severe contrast reactions the vast majority recover promptly and without any long term complications
