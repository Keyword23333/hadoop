8660234 she actually started counting then and said howd you get that many bruises and i didnt even realize i had some of those bruises
8660235 the first thing that came to mind was that i had a cancer or leukemia
8660236 i dont know how much you can trust this card
8660237 i dont know who makes it or if a doctor is saying they have no stds if theyve actually been tested i dont know how fake or real it is
8660238 me personally i would just want to tell the person just straight up i wouldnt want them to have to go through a whole system on the computer
8660239 i avoid it all just kind of waiting i think its the safest way to be sure about staying std free
8660240 i think its the most ridiculous idea thats ever been conceived it would say you know what they got the card they got the clean i can be unprotected no big deal so i think it makes having unsafe sex yeah more appealing
8660241 its trusting that the person hasnt had sex since they were tested its trusting that they are being honest with you because an std can show up within 24 hours
8660242 protection every time 100 percent no matter how long youve known your partner regardless of a card you have or anything like that

8660246 the association between magnesium sulfate and a lower incidence of cerebral palsy has biologic plausibility because magnesium stabilizes blood vessels protects against damage from oxygen depletion and protects against injury from swelling and inflammation all of which threaten the vulnerable preterm brain
8660247 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to evaluate the effect of magnesium sulfate on the incidence of cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8660248 our finding that magnesium sulfate protects against cerebral palsy is consistent with two previous randomized trials both of which were well done and which in total enrolled over 1 600 women our trial and the two others show that magnesium sulfate can reduce the risk of this devastating condition in preterm infants until we can prevent early preterm birth the best that we obstetricians can do is to improve the prospects for infants who are born very early i think that our study says that magnesium sulfate can help us do that

8660255 were not going to turn our backs on our friends because they have become successful
8660256 so for example we wouldnt not play feist because shes had humongous hits because her music is a perfect fit for our show that having been said theres a lot of stuff on our show that otherwise doesnt really get played on the radio at all
8660257 we never want it to seem like we know so much about this great music and here it is to be know y is not our goal we want to share music with people just like a friend who always seems to know everything about music but doesnt do it in a snobby way

8660262 i want to do a story on the rising india but also stories on the rest of the country that isnt rising so quickly and having trouble with globalization
8660263 western media have not handled india very well especially in television news where the focus is on tragedy poverty and natural disasters

8660266 you want to drive people to the internet and give them more information on the internet and then bring them back to the network
8660267 i think it shows that viewers want to be able to access content where and when they want it and that wont hurt television numbers
8660268 i think the 2008 summer olympics is certainly the first games in canada anyhow that we were able to really take advantage of mobile television
8660269 its also the type of event thats perfect for this platform it goes on all day and you may have a particular sport that you follow and you can pop in and get what you need and pull back out again its great to have this on demand or a live broadcast streaming this kind of content
8660270 i think we were able to take the olympic viewing out of your home and you could take it with you
8660271 the evidence is mostly indicative of what your canadian broadcasting company found is that it does help rather cannibalize the tv audience
8660272 i dont think the technology is ready i dont think consumers are aware of it either
8660273 from what weve seen were pleased to see the consumer enthusiasm for mobile olympic coverage
8660274 were sharing the data with clients to reveal just how those consumers leveraged mobile this games
8660275 the urban affair reflects the growing amount of activity and energy in downtown phoenix and so this years event will be even bigger and better
8660276 because we have more people living downtown and more arts and cultural options in our urban core than ever before

8660345 this was caused by a misunderstanding of our policy on using racial identification the copy editor took out the racial description supplied by the reporter thinking that there were not enough other descriptive elements to leave it in in fact the policy states that its all or nothing either theres enough information to make for a meaningful description which should include race or theres not enough of a description and all the elements of the description should be taken out of the story ive talked to the copy editor and slot on the story to make sure they understand the policy
8660346 wtf i got an active and i shot you and you didnt go down wtf you cheater stop glitching
8660347 i couldnt figure out why all of these kept flashing their lights at us as they passed us but now i know why were running dark we dont have any tail lights or running lights
8660348 do your hazards work you know your four way flashers do they work
8660349 yeah they work fine what the hell is that gonna do for our running lights and tail lights
8660350 you dont need running lights or tail lights if your four way flashers work just leave those on and get your ass to bristol the other vehicles on the road will be able to see you and youll be safe fix the lights tomorrow when you wake up and its daylight and you can see what you are working on goodnight and dont call me this late again im going back to bed love you son
8660351 your not gonna believe this but the brake pedal is lying on the floor it fell off dude
8660352 the way that i did it i think was better than the way its done today
8660353 me having time to grow up as a racecar driver but more importantly as a person i think was better than throwing a kid 19 20 years old into this im not saying its wrong doing that i just think it served me personally fine to do it the way i did it
8660354 i thought running the nationwide series allowed me a chance to mature i ran it full time for like four or five years and that was a great experience i learned a lot it enabled me to mature and made me a better racecar driver it made me a more mature person before i moved up into this then when i moved up into this i drove for a team that really didnt expect to win they were very happy running 15th 20th was a good day its a whole other criteria that i was doing compared to what theyre doing today to me i think the way i did it was in some ways better in other ways it was harder but it allowed me to grow and get a better understanding of what goes on here
8660355 i had no business driving stock cars at that age i was lucky to do it at that age i didnt drive go karts and legends cars and all those little things when i was a kid i didnt really start racing full time full sized cars until i was 16 or 17 and i shared my ride with my brother every other week
8660356 we werent winning and i didnt know what the future held for me i felt lucky to get in and be able to keep a job and afford to live the way that i do its exciting to see these young guys come in so much talent at such a young age i remember how i was at 18 i didnt have the mentality and the maturity to handle all the things that theyll face in the garage in and outside the car i think thats really where the owners and the mentors can be most careful is how this guy is affected by the attention outside the car i wish joey and those guys the best because theyre coming up and hopefully theyll have a lot of respect for the guys that have been here for a while and well all have a lot of fun out there racing and have some good close hard racing
8660357 its a lot different now than it was obviously with the younger drivers coming in you used to have to kind of prove yourself through the short tracks and do all that stuff and its not that drivers dont prove themselves now but people start racing at 5 years old now when i started racing most people started at 16 some kids were doing go karts i guess but all big bodied stock car stuff up in wisconsin you couldnt drive them until you had a drivers license so you couldnt really start any younger i think thats a big reason for it the kids can get experience a lot sooner than we used to be able to
8660358 hes a full time nationwide driver and with that expertise winning a race already this year and doing everything hes done in the nationwide series i believe hell be fine
8660359 theres not a whole lot of media hoopla over there on that side i feel like hes got the talent if he gets good communication with his crew chief which hes already worked on and done well with hell be fine
8660360 its not like when i first started in winston cup i was in the same boat as a lot of guys when they first get in
8660361 you do anything and drive anything to get in all youre looking for is seat time you dont think about winning races you think about making races now these guys are climbing into cars with winning experienced teams you put a really good driver into a really good car and they are going to get to the front
8660362 hes going to have a great advantage getting into equipment that is really really competitive right now
8660363 theyre not going to have to be searching for something as hes learning and dont forget i dont know how many laps that kid has in the new car but its a lot everywhere i go to test hes there hes got a lot of laps in these cars the biggest adjustment is going to be how competitive it is when you run 18th in a cup race youre in the middle of a dogfight when you run 18th in a nationwide race youre running really poorly its a whole other world the competition from top to bottom is just so much more competitive adjusting to that is going to be the biggest thing
8660364 i think for him the way things are hes more mature than most guys out there
8660365 from an experience standpoint we were real careful from day one and we didnt want to rush him hes been here three years if it took him three more years to get to cup that would be fine the reality of it is we watched everything he did really watching him last year in the camping world series and watching him test with our guys i think what you saw is a guy who the talent is there now well have to work with him theres a lot of stuff im not worried about the on track stuff as much as the off track stuff thats a lot required of him to be doing all that with his family surrounding him and our guys well be in good shape
8660366 i couldnt figure out why all of these kept flashing their lights at us as they passed us but now i know why were running dark we dont have any tail lights or running lights
8660367 do your hazards work you know your four way flashers do they work
8660368 yeah they work fine what the hell is that gonna do for our running lights and tail lights
8660369 you dont need running lights or tail lights if your four way flashers work just leave those on and get your ass to bristol the other vehicles on the road will be able to see you and youll be safe fix the lights tomorrow when you wake up and its daylight and you can see what you are working on goodnight and dont call me this late again im going back to bed love you son

8660395 that is the mandate that he mugabe was given by the sadc southern african development community regional bloc and he is not going to stop forming that new cabinet the mdc are not serious at all
8660396 you will be killing the talks once you form a government forget about talks it is a disaster and an act of insanity to think that mugabe can go it alone
8660397 formally we are going to write a letter to the facilitator south african president thabo mbeki about the breaches that have occurred
8660398 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government
8660399 there is some doubt whether it will start the production in the nankai trough on a commercial basis if we get only two year gas needs after spending eight years for production
8660400 we confirmed that the huge amount of gas is buried shallower in the sea of japan and that it is more concentrated in one spot so i think that extracting it in the sea of japan is easier and cheaper than that in the pacific ocean although the technology is still not established it is almost sure to start commercial production in or around ten years if we get a budget from the government
8660401 some deposits which taiwan found in its southern ocean are believed to be richer than that of japans eastern nankai trough china and taiwan might engage in disputes over the gas in the future
8660402 japanese officials are anxious that initiatives in the sea of japan might be taken away if the united states cooperates with china or south korea on developing the drilling technology such an anxiety might push the government to have technical cooperation with the united states rather promptly
8660403 violating team regulations concerning commercial activities and producing a negative influence on the preparations for the 2008 olympics

8660410 i remember myself and matt knocking down a rough instrumental version of this track on a day off in germany
8660411 it was only really a couple of riffs a sampled beat and the synth in the chorus but even then there was a wealth of melody going on its basically a pop song played loud hard and turned up to 11
8660412 i was offered playboy last year and again a couple of months ago and i did turn them down but thats not to say i wouldnt consider it in the future
8660413 i have no problems walking around the house naked or anything
8660414 ella jane you know you arent allowed to do that wheres mummy
8660415 sally anne let me show you how to wash your lunch box what did you do at school
8660416 ella jane tripped over molly rose in her eagerness to be first i tried to carry molly rose now clean and combed but she was too heavy for me and ella jane had monopolised dads attention

8660421 tell mummy to send you over at five o clock on friday sixty six blender street old swan liverpool love you all until then
8660422 daddy loves another lady now perhaps hell be happier now hes gone to live with her
8660423 girls i want you to meet your new stepmother this is cressida
8660424 how can she be my stepmother when you havent married her
8660425 and this is cecilia who is five like sally anne
8660426 this is sally anne and ella jane and darling little molly rose
8660427 ella jane thats rude merlin didnt that mother of yours teach you any manners
8660428 i thought theyd be prettier flavian is handsome but his daughters are plain
8660429 thats because of their clothes sally anne and ella jane dress like boys
8660430 perhaps she goes to a muggle school muggle playgrounds are supposed to be rude places
8660431 rude and rough our mummy wouldnt let us go to a muggle school
8660432 but i bet it isnt just the school i bet that girl learned her bad manners from her mummy i bet her mummy told her that the divorce was all our mummys fault because rude ugly people never admit that the divorce was their own fault
8660433 let them play their divvy snakes and lions if they want to ive had a much better idea
8660434 sally anne and ella jane did it it was idea
8660435 relax theres a little cash flow problem this end but youll have the money by the end of the week
8660436 julia you need to stop and smell the roses make time for bubble baths and art galleries play your piano take a holiday marry again its all in your attitude
8660437 i sent those connect a hex blocks for birthday as well as the tickets for dudley zoo and the crate of easter eggs you know i dont neglect my children and of course there will be gold in your account just as soon as gringotts has processed my royalties oh cressida wants a word something about arrangements for next weekend well im busy recording a new album so must dash
8660438 julia how dare you slander flavian to your children it doesnt matter how inadequate you feel about your failed marriage talking about infidelity in front of the girls is instructing them to take sides
8660439 it was ursula who told sally anne that flavian had been unfaithful sally anne only asked me if it was true was i supposed to lie
8660440 you were supposed to tell her not to poke her nose where it doesnt belong you certainly have no right to use judgmental words like adultery you are ruining this family with your spiteful gossip have you considered how it damages your children to be turned against their father like that if any more psychological abuse occurs flavian will apply for custody
8660441 mum if they thought we didnt love dad why would they make us live with him wouldnt it be more sensible to stop us visiting him at all mum are they going to stop us visiting dad
8660442 as long as you love both of us youll carry on living with me and visiting dad its only if the wizengamot thinks that somethings gone wrong well the wizengamot doesnt seem to understand how real families work
8660443 sally anne dont ever let anyone hear you say that we could all be in serious trouble if they thought you didnt like your stepmother tell yourself you love her as much as an aunt and everything will be fine for all of us
8660444 you can all have your new shoes next week isnt that worth it
8660445 do you want mum to have to do the jobs this evening
8660446 we nearly reached the end of the earths crust i bet we go through the mantle tomorrow and we climbed the next door tree and dropped water bombs youll never guess who walked past it was teacher mrs prunefrown we dropped a big one on her it serves her right for being mean to sally anne at school
8660447 sally anne is this true what did mrs prunefrown do
8660448 she shouted at me in p e because i couldnt climb the rope i was trying mum but im not good at p e mrs prunefrown shouts at everyone equally
8660449 i hope im never in her class shes nearly as mean as cressida no she isnt no one in the world could be as mean as cressida
8660450 shut your mouth its the truth the only people who are nearly as mean as cressida are ursula and cecilia they shout at us more than mrs prunefrown shouts at her class
8660451 everyone was christened then i think its a nice idea it welcomes the baby and everyone had a mangle too they didnt have another way of drying their clothes
8660452 because that would make creases in the clothes yes we do it that way nowadays but nowadays the ironing is much easier
8660453 nicola is not the most striking one out of girls aloud unless by striking you mean ginger
8660454 its nothing to do with her hair or the way her face or body is its that the sour faced old cow never smiles ever
8660455 she always looks peed off like she doesnt want to be in the band someone should show her the girls aloud bank account because if she worked at tescos and it would take a few years to build up to that level for her she wouldnt be making the money shes making now
8660456 shes got a great life flying all over the world yet her face looks like she works at netto
8660457 i cant stand him its no surprise i look miserable with him on my case and hes such a good looking bloke himself isnt he
8660458 im a personal friend of his guitarist and he put the message in and hes up for it
8660459 well just get in the studio have a few wines eat some cake and go for it

8660464 how do you manage to keep your bag so neat after a long day at school
8660465 did you notice her trunk everything folded up and colour coded sally anne doesnt anything jumble your stuff around
8660466 it helps me not to lose things heres a quill sophie
8660467 the house elves will re make it for you anyway because theyll think you cant have done it properly
8660468 sally anne would obey a notice to keep off the grass even if that did mean leaving a toddler to drown in the lake
8660469 okay im not trying to make trouble just send the younger ones around when they do break up
8660470 flavian are you barmy if you start sacrificing your access rights now youll never see your children again
8660471 we cant take the girls in august weve booked a boarding house in blackpool just flavian xavier and me were even sending ursula and cecilia to their father its time he took some responsibility our holiday is not going to be cancelled just because you choose to be awkward besides were not beginning the habit of separating your little trio and seeing them in ones and twos none of us will ever manage to keep track of that kind of arrangement so we need to access ella jane and molly rose in july thats flavians right under the wizengamot ruling the first half of each school holiday
8660472 youve learned a few tricks from your mother i see
8660473 i cook most evenings at mums where does cressida keep the flour
8660474 merlin knows here let me look in the larder why do you need to mix flour with the beef dont answer i can see its one of the great secrets of womankind flour coming up
8660475 turning into a proper little tomboy isnt she i hope shell agree to grow her hair out in time for aunt odettes next wedding i told you that odette had found her number four didnt i
8660476 well if she isnt she can always get divorced again she isnt having bridesmaids or anything its just a register office affair but shed like you all to dress up a bit ursula wants to wear black but that doesnt seem quite right for the occasion i think ursula will be the family beauty still we never really know do we i wonder what young xaviers up to too quiet is a bad sign put that casserole in the oven quickly and well go and look for them all
8660477 that pumpkin gold is gorgeous on both of you come on ursula it will look hideous on those pasty pale perks girls youll outshine them without needing to lift a wand
8660478 shes too busy playing dress ups with ursula and cecilia isnt she xavy
8660479 do you really want cressida to know what youve just been doing
8660480 well have to move some of cecilias stuff if im to put mine away
8660481 shes been monopolising flavian this evening she wants him all to herself
8660482 im going to go and stay with him next month
8660483 i dont want to see him do i have to go mummy i dont like my father
8660484 he wont belt girls of your age and im sure youre old enough by now to stay out of trouble if you try pass the salt molly rose
8660485 im glad i only have one mummy and one daddy in one house
8660486 daddy said our old school trunks were a disgrace so he donated them to a second hand shop and bought us these new ones theyre of dragon hide and my new flute case matches them exactly its a sterling silver flute too
8660487 does the silver flute sound better than the steel one
8660488 well it must mustnt it its pure silver daddy also bought me a new moggy shes a pedigree chinchilla and she cost forty five galleons
8660489 but only a little hes a bossy boots with his wife and he belts their daughters and he never lets ursula or me do anything
8660490 flavian is a poor man daddys one good point is that he has splosh and he does like his family to display it
8660491 he might have galleons but hes mingy about how he shares them out
8660492 he spends them all on that ambassadress for fashion deregulation natalie
8660493 and her brats primula cant wipe her own nose and marcellas barely bog trained but daddy bought them make overs at madam primpernelles
8660494 he thinks of them as his real family were just a nuisance to him
8660495 he doesnt listen to wheedling but he might cough up the goods on a really special occasion
8660496 no silly at christmas its a great secret but daddy heard about it at the ministry we shall need new dress robes
8660497 thats lucky since you always look gopping in dress robes
8660498 but whod invite you after all youre in gryffindor oh mummy did you hear any of that theres going to be a ball next term and well need new dress robes
8660499 its no good asking me for sickles perhaps odette has something you can borrow or cut down
8660500 not odette mummy you know she wears all that muggle stuff
8660501 dress robes is it well you certainly reward good dressing but we do have to be realistic i didnt get that muggle contract with my new album i can give you ten galleons each
8660502 thank you so much flavian we do understand that money is tight but youll be proud to see how far we make that ten galleons stretch
8660503 you didnt hear what they were saying before you came in their own father has already given them twenty galleons each they only pretend that hes mean
8660504 granny could you think about giving us our christmas presents in advance
8660505 because we cant go to the ball unless we have dress robes
8660506 we wouldnt ask you grandad but it would be unfair of us to ask flavian for he has his own children to consider
8660507 and daddy doesnt give us a knut we cant think why
8660508 ive no money but i can give you something better
8660509 you know that your late great grandfather was banished from his ancestral home that his niece burned his very name off the family tapestry
8660510 and pearls we could always ask aunt odette shes muggle loving and mingy but we could still ask what a pity aunt messalinas living in brazil
8660511 but only a small one and itll be twelve months before i see any money
8660512 that frown will spoil your pretty face sally anne dont worry about all that grown up stuff your dad can take care of it whats up with you
8660513 yes it is who can you tell your problems to if not to your own dad
8660514 its just that my hogwarts letter came today and it says i need dress robes
8660515 sally anne there just isnt money for luxuries like dress robes couldnt you wear whatever you wore to odettes last wedding
8660516 that was two years ago dad ive long since outgrown it
8660517 thats it you girls grow accio there you are sally anne this one will never fit ursula again
8660518 todo es tiempo me refiero a este suicidio que busca sus ra ces en mis d as

8660524 why does it have to be anybodys fault it was right and good for a while and now its not
8660525 travel is fatal to prejudice bigotry and narrow mindedness all foes to real understanding
8660526 i have been crucified with christ it is no longer i who live but christ who lives in me and the life i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
8660527 we were buried therefore with him by baptism into death
8660528 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation 6 the old has passed away behold the new has come
8660529 if you are a christian god created a union between you and christ as verse 5 says because of this union you died with christ when he died because you died you are now free from the guilt and power of sin in your fullest and truest identity that is in your union with christ and because of this unshakable position and identity you are already justified and you are most certainly being sanctified but you are not yet perfected therefore confirm this great transaction by reckoning yourself to be what you really are in christ
8660530 i said no to ha to him because neville had just asked me before lunch
8660531 so i said yes thinking that nevilles my friend and at least this way id get to go to the ball
8660532 and harry didnt really even ask ron suggested it because harry still didnt have a dance partner
8660533 why does this happen to me hermione why cant he even think of me that way
8660534 i need to stop liking him hermione hes never going to like me so why should i keep trying so hard to make it happen
8660535 if he cant see whats right in front of his face then its all the worst for him
8660536 theres nothing else to it hermione i have to stop i know that its not going to be easy not at all and i know that its probably going to take a very long time for me but i need you to help me is that okay
8660537 yesterday well that is i i was in the girls loo on the fifth floor and i heard nadia watson and chelsea hendricks from ravenclaw talking about a third year gryffindor
8660538 i was just about to leave when i heard well what i really heard was michael really likes the weasley girl from gryffindor
8660539 and then they said he was going to ask you to the ball but he heard someone else ask you before and that he well they said he was quite obviously crushed that someone else had done it before him ginny michael corner fancies you
8660540 ginny theres a fourth year ravenclaw in my muggle studies class whose name is michael corner do you know him
8660541 if other boys can like me then then that means that i am likeable
8660542 harry cant see whats right in front of him if he cant see you
8660543 well viktor krums no troll either i cant wait to see what his little fans are going to do when they see you with him bookish little hermione granger with the worlds best seeker
8660544 i can imagine rons face now hell be so stunned
8660545 i dont think ill really get over him though hermione
8660546 i dont think its possible ginny he was your first crush those are the hardest ones to let go of
8660547 is it okay to just give up though just stop trying
8660548 ginny you very well know that your brother is the thickest of the lot harrys a dense boy but once he sees how you really are ginny he wont be able to stop himself
8660549 ginny i thought you were going to spend some time with your dorm mates before we had to leave
8660550 hermione do you feel the same for me as i do for you
8660551 how do you feel about me what am i to you
8660552 what i meant to ask was do you find me as your friend a close friend or what anything platonic
8660553 i i think of you as a sister too hermione
8660554 i want to know what it is that you three are planning to do
8660555 whatever it is you three are going to do i want in
8660556 you said yourself that you care about me as if i were your sister would you really leave your sister in the dark about wherever it is that youre going off to because you know as well as i do that i may well just follow you wherever you go anyway
8660557 i need to know i need to know that even if youre not going to let me come that youre at least going to let me know what youre doing
8660558 if harry hasnt told you then i cant ginny please dont be angry with me
8660559 but just so i know just so that i can be sure can you answer one question just one without thinking of anyone but me
8660560 youre leaving arent you youre not coming back to hogwarts next year
8660561 just promise me hermione that youll stay safe and come back to me all three of you
8660562 source name may leak at 6 pm et with some sort of confirmation at 8 pm
8660563 an historic ad i think this is the first of its kind
8660564 sen mccain is going to have an ad thats going to air in battleground states around the time that sen obama is speaking tonight
8660565 hes going to be talking directly to his opponent so im going to leave it there but its going be very exciting i think that a lot of people are going to focus on it
8660566 i am going to sit back and create limited edition lingerie part 2 niki loveletter collection with matching lockets gallery
8660567 this means that partitions that are almost invisible by day can provide a pleasant diffused light
8660568 the new drink came after years of consumer research that showed customers wanted the occasional flavored drink for special occasions
8660569 maybe that decision by the philadelphia inquirer to hold back most of the newspapers copy from its website
8660570 dedicated to the spiritual and educational aspects of the labor movement
8660571 i think hell grow up to be an actor like me look sally anne isnt your little brother bursting with talent look at that yawn i think he has the plumpton nose
8660572 hands off flavian you might remember that newborns are fragile and keep the little ragamuffins away from him
8660573 im sure they didnt mean any harm be careful girls isnt it amazing to have a boy at last after all those girls
8660574 this is the second time shes hurt the baby she must be jealous
8660575 clothes youll all need new dress robes for the christening mummy and i thought it would be nice if our five daughters were dressed alike madam twilfitt has designed a special velvet robe just for our family but we still havent chosen the colour what do you think
8660576 and perhaps a special cake for molly rose when we go back to mums house
8660577 dont make mummy or flavian sound tight remember that theyve had to fork out for this expensive christening with no help from their exes daddy was so mingy he wouldnt pay a knut not even for these dress robes
8660578 hes now lord of all muck in the ministry but does that give him a sickle extra for his own daughters no all he cares about is throwing galleons at the debt on his fancy wedding and our new stepmother is gopping
8660579 you shouldnt say bad things about your stepmother or they might make you go and live with her
8660580 give your chin a rest ella jane what do you know about it
8660581 i wanted to name him after someone in the theatre
8660582 just grown up stuff darling lets light the candles for molly rose
8660583 did your stepmother give you new dresses this weekend that was sweet of her but i do wish shed told me the plan before she sent me the bill come on candles
8660584 mum i think theyre trying to make you pay for ursula and cecilia as well as for ella jane molly rose and me and theyre making you pay all not just half even though weve had to leave the robes behind in liverpool mum i think they i mean cressidas cheating
8660585 sally anne do you know how difficult it will be to challenge this bill if we request a wizengamot hearing it will cost us more than five hundred galleons anyway
8660586 we could try but then your father will take it to the wizengamot and well probably end up paying the court costs after all as well as the cost of the robes
8660587 well can we sell the robes i hated mine it was all scratchy
8660588 darling this is my problem not yours just just go to bed so that youll be ready for school tomorrow oh dear oh dear and i had only just managed to clear the last lot of debts that they dumped on me if we want to stay in this house ill be charring for a long time yet
8660589 and i will be faithful to you as long as we both shall live
8660590 sally anne dont worry this is different so different from when i married your father
8660591 lets be honest i married your dad for his looks and because the theatre life seemed exciting im marrying raymond because hes truly a friend he was loyal to his first wife so he has a good track record
8660592 it was she who left him she fell in love with someone else six or seven years ago raymonds been on his own all that time and hes a very good father
8660593 this time its step brothers jeremy is ten and christopher is eight do try not to let magic happen around them girls they still believe it doesnt exist well have to tell them eventually of course but let them get used to us as human beings before they think about us as witches now what colour shall we choose for the bridesmaids dresses
8660594 they allow for human nature they deliver food parcels to unemployed people and theres a sunday school programme why dont we try it out sometime
8660595 it is so unfair that you ask flavian to pay for their school excursions and new shoes
8660596 why do they want to go on those muggle excursions anyway you know very well that flavian has xavier and my girls to support now he shouldnt have to maintain two homes get your new fellow to pay for something for a change
8660597 you cant expect clinton to support them hes already putting their food on the table six days out of seven and we have two children of our own to consider and it would be wrong of me to go out to work while nathan and adam are so young yes yes i know youve acquired three stepdaughters but youve also acquired a working wife cant she support her own children what about her ex let him pay for something for a change
8660598 i spend as much on my sons food and clothes as you do on your daughters
8660599 and i have only two if the money isnt lasting am i subsidising the buftons mortgage
8660600 could you offer to pay goods in kind instead of cash thats what flavian offered me although in his case the only goods that arrived were those party dresses three years ago for which i ended up paying oh dear i only asked him to pay for half of the girls expenses but cressida seems to think i want him to pay for everything
8660601 cressida came right into the lounge after you were in bed she said i had to pay my share of the trip to cornwall that youll all be taking over the easter holidays what could i do i couldnt let her start a figh i mean the argument might have been loud and raymond might have tried to intervene so i gave her the money i hope i can sort it out with your father next weekend
8660602 mum let me see your bills i think i should be managing the money in this family and if we cant afford extra holidays we just wont go
8660603 jeremy and christopher are mine and i wont neglect sally anne ella jane or molly rose but it isnt my job to support adam nathan xavier ursula and cecilia as well well show them numbers and pay only whats fair
8660604 odette has finally hit the zenith of her career she is dancing swan lake tomorrow night
8660605 shes finally a prima donna were taking the children to the premi re performance tomorrow night im sure youll appreciate what an important family occasion this is cultural experiences aside so weve booked dress circle seats
8660606 youre lucky to be able to afford it cressida for we certainly cant
8660607 if odette cant supply her nearest relations with free tickets then im sure she understands that the children cant watch her dance until they are old enough to earn their own spending money i actually believe that its quite good for children not to have luxuries before theyve learned to work for them
8660608 i cant imagine what you must have done to deserve this punishment
8660609 y eso que lo dice un diario de izquierda as que imag nese
8660610 valign center height 57 gt i have a new email address
8660611 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8660612 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8660613 regardless of the mechanism or explanation physicians should be careful when assessing each patients medication needs
8660614 patients also need to take their medications exactly as prescribed after an ami statins in particular should only be withdrawn after an ami under close clinical supervision
8660615 yeah its made ginnys day really im glad hes back with them
8660616 i cant believe you kept it a secret for six weeks dad
8660617 well it was hard not to say anything to your mum it was even harder not to tell you but knowing ginny would almost certainly find out if i did i had to we needed to keep him safe for a while longer
8660618 did he apologize for what happened last summer with that idiotic pamphlet
8660619 i forgave him for it when i was assured by albus that he was truly sorry of course that was after i did something to him now dont look at me like that lily it wasnt anything bad i just turned his hair green for a full day dont worry he was in my office the whole day so no one saw him
8660620 at least you had the sense to keep him out of sight then i dont know what the people would say if they knew their new minister pranked an employee
8660621 i cant believe no one told arthur that percy was still the ministers secretary
8660622 oh albus cast a spell that altered his features while in the ministry
8660623 only albus and i could see what he really looked like we even gave him a false name parker williams same initials but totally different names
8660624 let the weasleys have some privacy to enjoy their reunion with percy
8660625 thanks so much for coming thank you james for helping percy
8660626 i wouldnt be as good at being minister if your brother and his organizational skills werent helping me
8660627 happy birthday ginny only two more years til were of age i cant wait see you tomorrow
8660628 fleur will be coming back in a few days to spend two weeks here getting to know mum she hopes to see you
8660629 youve all improved immensely with your wandless and wordless magic
8660630 im so proud of you now well take a break from that and concentrate on something both old and new you all have experience with the patronus charm there is another use for the charm aside from chasing off dementors and lethifolds it can also be used as a means of communication
8660631 now its your turn first id like you to take a few minutes to review casting the patronus
8660632 now i want the eight of you to pair off each pair will stand at opposite ends of the room and attempt to send messages to each other im sure you will all master it within the next two hours
8660633 sirius gave his word that he would be waiting here
8660634 thank merlin i was afraid for a moment that you werent coming
8660635 we will side along apparate you to your new home
8660636 you will understand in a moment why i need to be here narcissa
8660637 now i will go with you sirius will take draco
8660638 are we staying in one of those looks like a muggle area
8660639 yes it is but i think your mother would know where we are
8660640 no i dont sirius well not exactly it all seems familiar but i cant quite place where we are
8660641 now think about what i have told you and look over to your right
8660642 your old home it looks cleaner now than i remember it why couldnt i remember earlier
8660643 and what was that thing about the order of the phoenix
8660644 it used to be in the shape of a serpent
8660645 theres no way i would have my family here if i hadnt given it a good refurnishing and renovation wait until you see what ive done to the place
8660646 welcome to the new and improved ancient and noble house of black
8660647 do you really think id live here with my family if it still had all the original furnishings and d cor actually i had it all changed when i knew ti would be living with me at that time only the basement and my old room didnt have the old classic d cor but with ti moving in i decided he wouldnt need to endure the dark and oppressive atmosphere i grew up in after all hes a gryffindor just like me so i had the whole house renovated and cleaned up
8660648 oh everything shaped like serpents the doors knocker the chandelier a candelabrum on that table by the door and some old fashioned gas lamps the wallpaper was dirty and peeling off the floor had a threadbare carpet there were house elf heads mounted on that wall over there really dark and dismal
8660649 i really hated it when i lived here before so i had it all changed to this a lot brighter and cheerful dont you think
8660650 no need to antagonize your guests over the houses look however id like to lay down some rules while you are here for your safety of course
8660651 please come this way and ill explain everything you need to know
8660652 this house is under the fidelius charm which is why i had to whisper that phrase into your ears to reveal the house for your information draco the fidelius charm is a spell that hides the knowledge of something or some place inside another person who is called the keeper only the keeper may reveal the secret to those he or she wishes to tell
8660653 isnt that how the potters hid from the dark lord all those years ago
8660654 unfortunately their keeper betrayed them im sure you know who that was at any rate i am the keeper of this houses location that is because sirius has graciously allowed it to serve as the headquarters of the order of the phoenix this is a group of wizards and witches dedicated to fighting voldemort and his minions which i formed during the first war and reformed recently when voldemort became active again
8660655 are you asking us to become part of this order of the phoenix
8660656 though id like you to think about it in the meantime i must ask you to remain in your rooms whenever we have meetings of the order which we hold at night to protect both yourself and the members whose identities beyond that of sirius and i you must not know
8660657 if their identities are supposed to be secret then why did you bring me and draco here headmaster
8660658 you can call me by my first name its been many years since i have been your teacher
8660659 now to answer your question because at the moment this is the safest place aside from hogwarts for you both once the term starts draco will be at hogwarts where he will be equally safe from his father during the day you may go anywhere in the house but you must not leave the house under any circumstances unless accompanied by sirius or me do you both understand all that i have said
8660660 we will try to make your stay here as comfortable as we can
8660661 why dont you show them to their rooms sirius im sure theyd like to settle in
8660662 our guests have arrived please show them to the rooms we have prepared for them
8660663 im sorry for all those years we mistreated you i never wanted to treat you like that but lucius insisted on it
8660664 i is liking it here master ti treats dobby well
8660665 i guess we can wait for morning to see him please show us to our rooms good night albus good night sirius
8660666 i think narcissa is sincere in her desire to be away from her husband
8660667 as to young mr malfoy i am not as sure
8660668 i must be on my way there is still much to do before the term begins on september first
8660669 i dont know never noticed before what with sirius and sam being so tall when did you get here is draco with you
8660670 i usually read or play with lizzie of course during the week im usually with harry and the others at the burrow or potter manor
8660671 do you think i could go over there some time
8660672 um ill have to ask harry rose or their dad theres some kind of security on it that allows only people they allow to go there or even to find the place i think youd have better luck going over to the burrow of course i dont think ron will let you he just doesnt trust you sorry about that
8660673 its understandable considering our past it may take a while for them to get used to the new me so what do you guys do at those places
8660674 both the burrow and potter manor have an open area for that sometimes we get to practice spells especially the ones we learned in the dueling club
8660675 its a pity i didnt join the club last year id like to learn some of those spells
8660676 i guess i could ask harry about it ill go over later and ask him
8660677 its great to see you you only come over for dumbledores lessons nowadays
8660678 youre our friend youre always welcome here you can come over anytime even if we didnt have the wandless and wordless magic lessons
8660679 well i only came over today because i wanted to ask you guys something
8660680 you see my mother and brother finally decided to leave malfoy manor and get away from father sirius and professor dumbledore brought them to our home last night
8660681 im so happy to have them both with us i got talking with draco and hed really like to learn some of the spells we learned in the dueling club and i thought he could also learn wandless and wordless magic though i havent told him about that part yet i was wondering if i could bring him over on monday when we have our lessons with professor dumbledore
8660682 bring the ferret over here then teach him what were learning hell just tell voldieshorts what were doing well lose our advantage
8660683 look ti its not our decision youll have to ask professor dumbledore if draco could join our lessons and my dad will have to add his name to the floo network so he could get here
8660684 but cant you tell professor dumbledore that you dont mind if draco joins us
8660685 im sure if you dont give any objections professor dumbledore will let him join us
8660686 you can ask sirius to contact him so you can ask him
8660687 your idea has merit ti maybe some positive interaction with harry and the others will convince draco to stay on our side you have not told him about your animagus training or the wandless and wordless magic lessons have you
8660688 i think that should continue to remain hidden from him for the moment
8660689 the fewer people know that the less chance it will become known to voldemort
8660690 im not saying he will run off and tell voldemort but if he were to fall into the hands of a death eater it will be easy to get whatever he knows about harrys abilities from him we must minimize any chances of that happening
8660691 dont sulk its already a big thing for draco to be allowed to go to potter manor i dont think james will be happy to allow that but if albus says it would be a good idea hell add draco to the people allowed to floo into the manor
8660692 on monday we will review the spells you learned in the dueling club and have some dueling sessions i will go to potter manor to talk to james and explain things to harry and your other friends
8660693 this will be of great help in turning draco towards us
8660694 im sorry albus i refuse to let a death eaters son enter this house
8660695 ti is nothing like his father youve seen that from the first day he arrived at hogwarts ive seen it every time i see him with sirius draco on the other hand is too much like his father ive seen that last year when i taught defense at hogwarts i do not believe he can change and be brought out of the darkness
8660696 he seems to think his brother is becoming a better person
8660697 at this time i dont want to risk my familys safety for the small benefit dracos presence here and closer interaction with harry and his group might bring at least sirius home is protected by a fidelius charm but this place is just too big for that being unplottable is our best defense so no i do not want to add draco malfoy to the safe list he will not come here i also think its a bad idea for him to learn everything harry and his friends know
8660698 very well james i will tell ti of your decision i daresay that he will be very angry and hurt by it
8660699 well then i bid you good day i will be off to grimmauld place harry rose good day to you
8660700 i hope so too but im just not convinced draco is turning away from his father and voldemort
8660701 hey its not my fault if you guys cant strategize
8660702 it looks like your mum was right that day they first did magic harry
8660703 those three will be as close as the three of you
8660704 not as close as the two of us are right gin
8660705 you suddenly fell over and looked dazed did you have another vision
8660706 i dont know but its safer to assume it for now
8660707 i just talked to harry and told him what rose saw
8660708 i hope its not a coincidence the order is meeting and we dont know where i knew i should have at least insisted that we know where headquarters is well the first thing we do is send a patronus message to professor dumbledore im not sure how long it will take for the message to get to him then we head over to your house by floo we can at least delay whoever is attacking your home until the order gets there
8660709 ginny why did you have to teach that to her all right all right maggie you can come now get these off of me
8660710 i happen to agree with her she won her year level in the dueling tournament didnt she well be there anyway with her
8660711 nev you should know by now that these girls are just as stubborn as we are ive sent the patronus message to professor dumbledore while you and maggie were messing about wed better get to hermiones home come on
8660712 much different from ma barker no hint of criminality ever was suggested against philomena gotti
8660713 what weve learned by watching how the product is used and through user feedback is that skypecasts is not quite measuring up to our high standards and expectations for connecting and delighting our users
8660714 we dont ever cheer for the phillies eagles or flyers do we
8660715 fly eagles fly uh i mean we are penn state
8660716 i dont read blogs i dont have time for blogs i dont have time for that stuff ill talk to you on the phone ill talk to you in person i dont care to talk to nobody on the internet better watch out that internet will ruin your life

8660719 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8660720 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8660721 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
8660722 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8660723 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
8660724 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
8660725 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
8660726 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
8660727 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
8660728 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
8660729 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
8660730 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
8660731 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
8660732 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
8660733 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
8660734 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
8660735 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
8660736 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
8660737 aint it funny how the money makes the honey taste like nothing financial planning for tough times
8660738 he has called us with strange calls this is kenny chesney
8660739 he had a thing for chelsea clinton i dont know how he had expressed his infatuation with her but apparently it was enough for the secret service to come and look at it
8660740 if i was voting tonight on the requested zoning i would probably still vote no
8660741 but i dont mind them starting the process next month instead of next year
8660742 yeah i need to do that but really start making decisions to follow what hes revealing to me

8660749 as for celebrities john mccain talks out of both sides of his mouth he happily accepts heidi montags support and campaigns with daddy yankee if were going head to head on celebrities whose support would you rather have theirs or george clooneys and brad pittss and bruce springsteens
8660750 john mccain mocks me all the time he has nothing positive to say because he has

8660752 my dads a retired firefighter lewis winter i grew up around here in the old stations
8660753 i was coaching baseball at hendrix i would stand over there at the baseball fields and watch the fire trucks go by something in me said i had to pursue that
8660754 if you talk to a lot of firefighters firefighting is in your blood its who you are
8660755 it just felt like this is my calling and i was lucky enough to get hired i never looked back and its a great job
8660756 we dont necessarily do it for the honor we dont do it to be looked upon in any different manner its just what we do it personifies who we are almost
8660757 i spent several years in the training division thats a monday through friday job
8660758 you deal with a budget the administrative aspects of the department when i was promoted to district chief i went back to shift work
8660759 in a way its not that big a change but the duties and responsibilities that come with this job have kept me very busy
8660760 in a word yes it was such big shoes to fill i dont know if ill ever be able to really fill his shoes
8660761 thirteen years ago when chief bart castleberry interviewed me he asked me where do you see yourself in 20 years
8660762 sometimes i miss being on the nozzle being in with the guys but in this position i have more of an impact on the fire department
8660763 represents the next generation of firefighters theyre all very comfortable in their firefighting capabilities but they also represent a new generation in that youre seeing more education for them in hazardous chemicals and even ems this represents a new generation that are not only good at what they do on the fire grounds but are also continuing their education
8660764 talking helps our minds to organize what happened it lets us put away things that have happened to us so they arent in the way every time we are thinking
8660765 we talk about them until our mind gets organized about what happened then theyre not such a big deal anymore finally they start to feel like ordinary memories and we can stop thinking about them all the time
8660766 we dont forget them but they stop taking up all our thinking so we can get on with whats happening now in our lives and not worry any more about it
8660767 but just the opposite happens if we have to keep something big a secret first of all we have to create a special place in our minds to keep it chock full of all the stuff we cant tell
8660768 you have to lock it up really tight so even you cant get there very easily and if you dont then you dont have any room in your mind for other thinking
8660769 when you first do it first create a troubled place and manage to get it locked up its easy to think youve made it go away
8660770 but the fact is just the opposite is true everything you put in there it keeps really fresh like its just happened so if you accidentally crack open the door everything will hurt horribly all over again
8660771 what happened to you didnt happen to you because you are a bad person it didnt make you a bad person because it happened it just happened
8660772 and now its time for it to be over its time to open the door on the troubled place and clean all that junk out not to throw it away because those memories are a part of your memories part of what makes you you
8660773 but its time to make them ordinary to talk about them until you understand how you felt what you feel did what other people did

8660907 last seasons runner up villarreal travels to osasuna on sunday without injured midfielder robert pires together with strikers nihat kahveci and giuseppi rossi the absence of the attacking duo who scored 29 of the teams 63 goals last season may mean a spanish league debut for united states striker jozy altidore who joined the club from new york
8660908 obviously there is some relief with the result we knew it would be a difficult game against a quick well organised team
8660909 the positive was that we played a little better than recently we want to win trophies but we also understand the need for money

8660923 wie kann es eigentlich sein dass auf dem karton nicht klausur mit f nf ausrufezeichen stand

8660962 there were two players luiz felipe scolari identified one was deco and one was robinho and we have already seen the impact deco has made on the premier league
8660963 i think the squad is strong and capable of competing in all competitions without robinho but with him it is an added dimension
8660964 thats an awful lot of money for just one player but you cannot accuse chelsea or roman abramovich of not dishing out the big money when they are after a player they really want
8660965 addressing the issue of knife and other violent crime it emphasises that what is really needed are long term strategic partnerships between churches community groups the police criminal justice partners and local authorities
8660966 we are asked whether we are paid for the work we are doing and when told that we are not there is an acceptance that we are there in good faith
8660967 when we tell somebody to just take it down and theres no penalty theres no arrest theres no fine its very easy for them to continue to do it

8660971 today the challenges of seeking visible unity appear to be even stronger but we nevertheless look to the next sixty years with hope and confidence as we are inspired by the spirit of our ecumenical ancestors who made amsterdam 1948 possible
8660972 a serious and equitable response to climate change will require rich countries to pay billions in public funds to help poor countries develop in a sustainable low carbon manner so why have the eu which like to claim global leadership in the response to climate change turned up with empty pockets again
8660973 we have already invested a lot in bins for dog waste and our wardens patrol the area regularly but obviously people are not getting the message
8660974 i want to remind people that although they are welcome to take their dogs onto the green we will not tolerate them making a mess that everyone else has to put up with
8660975 roberts was in a position of trust and his actions have had devastating consequences for the charities and people involved
8660976 he was regarded as a family friend by two of the victims which has made his deceit even harder for them to bear
8660977 roberts not only used the cash he had stolen to pay his business debts he also used it to fund his own lifestyle owning two properties and putting his children through university
8660978 the future of some of the charities is under threat as a result and i only hope they are able to get some of their money back now this case is over

8660992 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8660993 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8660994 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8660995 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8660996 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8660997 i would say this is the biggest response weve ever got from a campaign or a candidate
8660998 this is really unprecedented with the show the way that people are flooding the calls and our email boxes
8660999 but do you think that most the delegates on the floor really understand that president kerry is not going to pursue a policy in iraq that is essentially different from the one that george bush is pursuing

8661012 no other book teaches so much so fast or so thoroughly
8661013 this book is by far the best computer programming book i have ever bought you can go into my upstairs closet and find 20 30 books that i have purchased since the days of vb6 all together they could not add up to as much information as you have given me in the first 11 chapters of this book
8661014 i want to start today by congratulating senator obama and senator biden on their nominations and we look forward to a robust campaign
8661015 just because hes not ready to be president doesnt mean we wont see a lot of glitz and glamour tonight
8661016 we already know hes a rock star and can bring 85 000 people to the stadium but what happens about the shows over
8661017 our question for obama is what have you done and what have you run
8661018 barack obamas response was to urge caution whos experience in judgment was best in that situation
8661019 we conclude that reversal of clarks conviction is necessary in the case to ensure fairness and integrity of the judicial process
8661020 accordingly we hold that the court committed plain error when it failed to give the accomplice jury instruction and that clarks convictions must therefore be reversed on this basis
8661021 i would reverse clarks conviction outright and not remand for a new trial
8661022 theres hp theres sony theres toshiba i have no idea what to do
8661023 were a mac family but microsoft is cheaper and i dont know im torn

8661025 theres a lot more variety in pcs but i believe with macs you kind of keep it simple
8661026 the key to proper snacking is a nice balance of protein fiber and good fats to keep blood sugar levels stable and the kids satisfied
8661027 a cheese stick or a string cheese pairs perfectly with a piece of fruit an apple banana pear or whatever your kid likes
8661028 its a great combination of calcium and protein from the cheese and vitamins and fiber from the fruit
8661029 whether its cereal crackers or granola bars you always want the first ingredient listed to be whole grains and for each serving to contain four grams of fiber or more
8661030 this will generally ensure that the snack is not too high in sugar and will help keep your child or yourself satisfied longer

8661038 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this
8661039 i think its a kind of personal touch its nice maybe every phone that gets a full quality test should have its testers picture taken and left on there and the working conditions look pretty good

8661047 california and michigan are probably the two toughest places on engines
8661048 the race is 500 miles so it creates a challenge for the engine builders you have to get your car handling good but the power of the car is very important and you have to weigh in the reliability factor when we run our engines on the reliability dyno michigan is where we run it which is very similar to california
8661049 its not a track with a tremendous amount of grip

8661051 california has a lot more grip in the spring because its cooler
8661052 now that its hotter its a good bet that the tracks going to be slick on race day which is good thats why the groove will widen out and thats why guys can move around on the race track the way they can
8661053 this new car has less downforce than the other car so handling is even more important
8661054 every team is trying something and this is one of our latest pieces to try to get the car to turn a little better without being so loose off the corners
8661055 if your car is driving well one that keeps you up toward the front all day because its fast then just two tires can keep you pretty quick
8661056 in that situation you could make a big gain at the end by just taking on two tires and maintaining your track position even some guys who are behind and dont have their car the way they want by taking on two tires the track position they gain helps out more than four tires would
8661057 but when you get right down to it i think california is a track where if your cars good then it doesnt matter whether you take two tires or four

8661106 come nel caso del primo congresso continentale svoltosi a citt del messico nel novembre del 2005 per il continente americano e del secondo tenutosi nel gennaio del 2007 a bangkok in thailandia per lasia anche questo terzo incontro sar dedicato alla presentazione del compendio della dottrina sociale della chiesa cattolica pubblicato nel 2004
8661107 al servo di dio giovanni paolo ii che ha affermato ha sostenuto con coraggio la pubblicazione del compendio e a papa benedetto xvi che nella sua prima lettera enciclica deus caritas est parla del compendium come lo strumento di riferimento pi autorevole per ispirare lopera volta a ottenere un ordine sociale pi giusto
8661108 se lannuncio della giustizia e della pace parte integrante del compito di evangelizzazione ne deriva che la promozione di questi valori dovr anche far parte del programma pastorale di ciascuna comunit cristiana ecco perch insisto sulla necessit di formare tutti gli operatori pastorali in modo adeguato in vista di tale apostolato
8661109 come corpo organizzato allinterno della comunit e della nazione la chiesa ha il diritto e il dovere di partecipare pienamente alledificazione di una societ giusta e pacifica con tutti i mezzi a sua disposizione nella misura in cui con queste sue attivit contribuisce a ridurre lignoranza a migliorare la salute pubblica e a favorire una maggiore partecipazione di tutti ai problemi della societ in spirito di libert e di corresponsabilit la chiesa crea le condizioni per il progresso della giustizia e della pace
8661110 indica la strada che luomo deve seguire in questo mondo per entrare nel regno di dio il suo insegnamento quindi si estende a tutto lordine morale e soprattutto alla giustizia che deve regolare le relazioni umane ci parte della predicazione del vangelo
8661111 il soggetto adeguato alla dottrina sociale non nientaltro che tutta la comunit ecclesiale
8661112 la dottrina sociale della chiesa perch la chiesa il soggetto che la elabora la diffonde e la insegna
8661113 tutta la comunit ecclesiale sacerdoti religiosi e laici concorre a costituire la dottrina sociale la diversit di compiti carismi e ministeri al suo interno
8661114 la chiesa vede nelluomo in ogni uomo limmagine vivente di dio stesso
8661115 uomini e donne che nelle circostanze concrete della storia sono il cuore e lanima del pensiero sociale cattolico e tutta la dottrina sociale della chiesa infatti si sviluppa a partire dal principio che afferma la dignit inviolabile della persona umana
8661116 annunciare cristo dunque rivelare alluomo la sua dignit inalienabile che dio ha riscattato mediante lincarnazione del suo unico figlio
8661117 luomo non pu vivere in condizioni di vita sociale economica culturale e politica infra umane ecco il fondamento teologico delle lotta per la difesa della dignit personale per la giustizia e la pace sociale per la promozione umana la liberazione e lo sviluppo integrale delluomo e di ogni uomo
8661118 questo principio deve essere il soggetto il fondamento e il fine ultimo di tutta lazione sociale e di ogni progetto di sviluppo
8661119 il principio personalista deve trovare espressione concreta nella promozione della dignit umana a ogni livello contro ogni tipo di discriminazione sia essa economica politica linguistica razziale religiosa o di qualsiasi altro tipo
8661120 non un sentimento di vaga compassione o di vacua angoscia per le disgrazie di cos tante persone sia vicine sia lontane ma al contrario si tratta di una determinazione ferma e perseverante a impegnarsi per il bene comune ovvero per il bene di tutti e di ciascuno perch siamo tutti realmente responsabili di chiunque altro

8661218 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embaressment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8661219 he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame
8661220 samantha has not and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful

8661243 this is an important day for the state of california and its infrastructure development and we applaud the governor for signing ab 3034 and putting the decision of high speed rail into the hands of the voters
8661244 investment in high speed rail will help bring california on par with other states and nations that have invested in high speed trains and goods movement systems
8661245 in addition high speed rail will also help create thousands of jobs and assure california maintains its place as a major player in the global economy

8661257 when i dressed him for the street he was one of the three best dressed men internationally along with prince rainier
8661258 when he stepped out i did not want him to look like a rock n roll or an r amp b singer i wanted him to look like gq
8661259 i met him before he was a prominent figure he was very poor and unknown
8661260 i met him in west memphis arkansas he was playing with a band and nobody was talking to him so i began to strike up a conversation with him
8661261 he did not have a lot but he was intellectual
8661262 he told me that if he ever became famous or rich that he would take care of me because i had been kind to him
8661263 he called to tell me that he wanted me to come over and celebrate with them
8661264 i saw how the audience went wild over him and i was awed by that
8661265 i had never seen him in a format like this i had only seen him as a poor person
8661266 i said that you are too big to be going to a regular barber shop you need to hire your own barber
8661267 he started saying dee youre right you can come to my studio and do my hair
8661268 his office was red black and white so i would buy the towels and chair cloths to match and i had his initials engraved in them i would make him feel like somebody
8661269 he would call me over while he was conducting his big business meetings and i would give him a manicure
8661270 we were on our way to new york and when we arrived i asked our banker the guy who handled the money to give me 500 and i went to saks fifth avenue
8661271 his stuff was raggedy and a star doesnt dress like that
8661272 when he saw it he was like a kid in a candy store
8661273 while in new york my brother came to see us and he brought a friend along who wore a chain to honor isaac
8661274 hot buttered soul we designed them and he made them
8661275 isaac loved music many times he would be out there jiving and enjoying the music of the opening acts the movement which was the band
8661276 i never missed an opening and i never missed a closing
8661277 the opening was to see the way people received him and the closing was to see how well they enjoyed him
8661278 isaac was helping people that could not find jobs those were a lot of his old friends
8661279 we played at mostly black colleges and there was not a time that he did not donate something to the student union
8661280 i miss isaac his music was tremendous most people do not know that a lot of the music that we did was done with a live symphony not the synthesizer this was the sound that he wanted
8661281 he was a musical genius i love classical music today
8661282 the camaraderie we shared he was mischievous and he was funny we kicked it like that
8661283 i have had such a good life that sometimes i had to pinch myself
8661284 we just thought that we could kick it forever but we can not

8661293 we will appeal the case we are going to be vindicated on appeal
8661294 its a finding that they failed to meet the basic essential needs of an inmate
8661295 using their jail to incarcerate those with outstanding traffic fines

8661301 the basement will allow us to eliminate the need for a new pump house
8661302 we can then use that building for new storage the new design will also feature a party room game area and locker rooms
8661303 i still think we have some questions that need to be answered

8661311 a integra o dos jogadores novos est a decorrer bem e nada nos diz que temos de fazer altera es de fundo na nossa forma de jogar
8661312 um jogo que vai acarretar sempre riscos para as duas partes
8661313 os campeonatos n o se ganham nos jogos entre as grandes equipas mas sim nos outros
8661314 os cl ssicos s o jogos especiais para toda a gente como atestam os cerca de 3 300 adeptos portistas garantidos na luz que podem influenciar pontualmente mas nunca s o decisivos
8661315 o envolvimento diferente e s vezes o comportamento dos jogadores tamb m diferente
8661316 o empate do benfica a n s n o nos afectou nada
8661317 apesar de n o ter sido uma exibi o de top foi boa e segura
8661318 nestes jogos n o h favoritos cada uma das equipas procura ser melhor do que a outra em momentos mas ningu m sabe quem vai ganhar
8661319 ainda ontem quarta feira vimos o vit ria de guimar es ser eliminado da fase de grupos da liga dos campe es por um auxiliar
8661320 surge a suspeita de que algu m nos estados unidos possa ter provocado intencionalmente este conflito para agravar a situa o e dar prefer ncia na luta competitiva a um dos candidatos pelo posto de presidente dos estados unidos
8661321 para que realizar durante anos dif ceis negocia es e buscar solu es de compromisso para os conflitos tnicos mais f cil armar uma das partes e empurr la para matar a outra parte
8661322 lets hope we do not see any direct confrontation in that
8661323 uma s rie de tremores foram registrados desde o dia 25 de agosto numa regi o sismicamente sens vel a 200 km a oeste da ilha de vancouver

8661326 unless the state of texas violates its own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot
8661327 we are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation when we miss deadlines we get no second chances this is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy
8661328 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable
8661329 therefore republicans and democrats should be held to the same standards
8661330 rabi juan manuel hola candy pues s te perdiste de algo jeje en esta clase expl

8661332 as ansf e as for as da coaliz o realizavam patrulhas de seguran a na prov ncia quando foram atacadas v rias vezes por insurgentes portando armas de pequeno calibre granadas lan adas por foguete e morteiros
8661333 um grande n mero de baixas produziu se durante os combates entre soldados afeg os e insurgentes mas n o se conhece o n mero exato de mortes
8661334 no campo de batalha foram deixados 12 corpos de insurgentes mortos
8661335 i thought if i dont get out of here im done i opened the door and jumped out
8661336 i had about two or three seconds to do what i did
8661337 did we overspend there yes but i think every one of those is for the benefit of the child
8661338 you can have a big balance in that fund if you have a big project
8661339 first of all we are profitable the bank is still strong the loan quality is good and this doesnt impact trust company customers at all
8661340 the fdic was not happy with the extent to which we did that
8661341 its a strategy that got pushed too far magnitude is the issue
8661342 i think we will have fixed things pretty closely in six to 12 months
8661343 our plan is to have cured everything in a year
8661344 an inordinate volume of brokered deposits that jeopardize the financial condition of the bank
8661345 they have increased the capital requirements over the normal capital requirements
8661346 operating with management whose policies and practices are detrimental to the bank and jeopardize the safety of its deposits
8661347 operating with a board of directors that does not provide adequate supervision over and direction to the management of the bank to prevent unsafe and unsound banking practices
8661348 if they would want to go through the process of wanting us to give that money back
8661349 the department of revenue did a thorough and complete job and followed the law in making its decision
8661350 is they decided to apply a standard of review that is very favorable to the department of revenue essentially they went down a path that requires them to uphold the departments decision unless they find it very erroneous thats a tough standard to overcome for the hospital
8661351 cumulatively as the village of homer looks at this process its a very long process
8661352 and there are different reasons for it but now were down to the illinois environmental protection agency not providing these permits the net of this is its been eight years in the making and people are getting weary and want to see some progress and now were up against a bureaucratic wall
8661353 and it definitely has taken longer due to iepa staffing reductions
8661354 due to that the current window for financing is closed and that has shoved homer off till the next window april 1 2009
8661355 staff cuts and bleeding these agencies to death is starting to take its toll
8661356 i dont have a problem with being lean and mean but you have to have enough people to get your workload done
8661357 its admittedly a process with a lot of steps and it has been a challenge with our shrinking staff numbers to keep up with the number of requests coming in
8661358 i dont want to sound critical of the iepa since i think i know what theyre up against
8661359 but the permits need to be provided in a timely manner delays cost everyone money
8661360 im not going to put it all on the iepa because we lost some points on some funding and then i believe we lost points because we didnt have a construction permit
8661361 it takes some of the obstacles out of the way to talk about kids
8661362 youre surrounded by all the people that you remember from school
8661363 if you are really struggling in that first three or four weeks get some help from us
8661364 in less than four years you will be high school seniors
8661365 we have had people in this high school who have gone on to great things
8661366 you really need to start off at a good point
8661367 you have to start figuring some of those things out
8661368 im worried about the classes and all the detentions im going to get from being late

8661374 we are thrilled to have mytoons as a new partner
8661375 almost everyone has childhood memories of these great cartoons we look forward to sharing these classics and other quality animated videos from mytoons with the vuze community and introducing mytoons content to a new generation of online viewers
8661376 with the recent rise of cg animation the mytoons cartoon classics channel is a great way to look back at the hand drawn origins of animation and appreciate how the art has evolved
8661377 we recognize the vast creative talent that went into these classic animations and hope that they will not only entertain but will also inspire the vuze audience to create compelling new high resolution content
8661378 in case you missed the photo above the final tennessee tally was obama 51 v clinton 32 if im not mistaken this means two delegates did not vote also if im not mistaken clinton came out of the primary with 40 pledged district delegates this means only eight delegates changed their vote every clinton delegate i spoke to said they would vote for clinton because thats what voters in their district elected them to do but they would support obama in the general election
8661379 obviously the functional purpose of it is still important and we ought to watch that we get whats going on there as quickly as possible get it moving
8661380 if theres a reasonable balance between aesthetics and cost we will take a look at it as a community and hopefully be able to discuss it and move it ahead
8661381 nice of you to stop by its only been what about a year since you took me out of your nintendo ds and stuck me in your games drawer to play

8661411 after their triumphant dramatic success with no country for old men the coen brothers revert to sophomoric snarky mode in burn after reading a dark goofball comedy about assorted doofuses in washington d c only some of whom work for the government the short snappy picture tries to mate sex farce with a satire of a paranoid political thriller with arch and ungainly results
8661412 had been asked to act like cartoon characters in this tale of desperation mutual suspicion and vigorous musical beds all in the name of laughs that only sporadically ensue

8661421 calls on the indian authorities and in particular security forces to respect the right to freedom of assembly and expression and comply with international human rights principles in controlling the demonstrators
8661422 the use of force should be proportionate to the threat posed and firearms must only be used in dispersing a violent assembly to protect individuals against an imminent threat of death or serious injury
8661423 the acting high commissioner calls for thorough and independent investigations into all killings that have occurred so far
8661424 leaders of the different protesting groups have a responsibility to ensure that demonstrations are peaceful and that the demonstrators are not carrying sticks guns or other weapons and refrain from intimidation
8661425 hey aaron love your project im working hard on my own project so wish me luck too
8661426 yes i have the characteristics needed as qualifiers to the industry
8661427 thats what we are expecting and we are planning to give passage a safe area for them to come out of that
8661428 i read in a forum that someone else had the problem too
8661429 no i have not managed to reproduce it in safe mode
8661430 have you ever seen the problem when all firefox extensions have been turned off
8661431 i encounter it only after ff has been running for a while gt 60 min
8661432 can we at least call this windows only i havent seen any reports of it happening in other oses
8661433 both mozilla and adobe have been aware of the issue since late may but as yet no solution has been found
8661434 one workaround solution is to install the flash 10 player which is still in beta
8661435 ah if only all player code were published then the problem would be easy to solve
8661436 he also took a minute to trumpet mozillas open source philosophy since firefoxs code is open adobe can look at it to try to determine what is going on but mozillas team cant look into flash beltzner didnt blame adobe for the bug itself but he did say that adobes traditional closed software architecture is slowing down their investigation we hit a wall when its a closed source solution he said
8661437 oh i saw someone on a forum describe a similar thing
8661438 finger pointing is common in software troubleshooting and i give both mozilla and adobe credit for only generally waving not pointing their fingers at each other unfortunately neither team seems to have developers who can reproduce this issue which just keeps the ping pong game going
8661439 what i find most interesting is the way the differing philosophies of mozilla and adobe are slowing down resolution of this issue if both companies were open then any developer at mozilla adobe or elsewhere could get into things and start experimenting to find a fix if both companies had closed philosophies then their engineers could swear each other to the secrecy swap source code and together fix the issue

8661456 i know all about the highs and lows when it comes to england
8661457 so im trying to maintain a consistent level so that i enjoy the successes like this but make sure that i turn up at the oval ready to secure the series
8661458 it was very tough to take when i was dropped but there are two ways you can take something like that either moan about it and blame everyone else or dust yourself down and get on with the business of trying to come back
8661459 one of the big things ive learned is that in the past when ive been left out ive chased playing for england
8661460 all i wanted was to play for england and so i looked too far ahead this time i kept it simple test cricket is fantastic and the time i had playing it was awesome
8661461 so of course ill be looking to get back in but i dont want to get too far ahead of myself and im being strict on myself the oval is what im focused on
8661462 he was brilliant but the thing im trying to tell matty and drum into him and the young players is that its great to be on top of a wave but youve got to try to get to that level where youre cool calm and responsible and you deliver day in and day out
8661463 its brilliant because it has been a headache for however long with our wicketkeeper but lets hope it stays good because hes a hell of a batsman
8661464 he has said well done weve played well once now lets do it twice okay weve done it twice now lets do it three times in a row and so on
8661465 the energy the buzz the skill levels and the fitness of the guys has been increased since i was last involved and it is fantastic to be a part of it now
8661466 i dont think it happens overnight i think it is down to a lot of hard work
8661467 tendo em vista a situa o criada a r ssia n o teve outra op o moral sen o apoiar a demanda dos povos da oss tia do sul e da abkh zia
8661468 no que diz respeito ao apoio somos aliados da r ssia isso diz tudo haver uma declara o do presidente lukashenko e a tudo ser dito
8661469 segundo a avalia o comum de karadzic e de sua equipe de assessores n o conv m pronunciar se sobre uma acusa o que ser emendada em breve
8661470 you cant tell me that any terrorist is going to make anything out of the fact you issued nsls to at amp t and verizon
8661471 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8661472 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8661473 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8661474 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin heres guessing the irony of that expression is lost on the morons running os campaign ed like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8661475 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8661476 he got into the files just yesterday so we wanted to have him on to find out what he found and if at all possible we wanted to get the obama campaign to get their side of the story
8661477 thats why the uproar is kind of amazing because we wanted the obama campaigns take as well
8661478 from where the chinese restaurant used to be two blocks down half a block toward the lake next door to the house where the yellow car is parked managua nicaragua
8661479 so we have an amusing little system that no one from anywhere else can understand
8661480 theres no way on gods earth that theyd know what youre talking about
8661481 from the little tree two blocks to the south 50 varas to the east
8661482 i made it one semester in college and then failed out i had my professor tell me that he could give me an a but that he wasnt really helping me by doing that i wanted to teach special ed kids like myself down the road but that wouldnt happen if i didnt learn how to read and write so i told him to fail me
8661483 it puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again
8661484 the remedy to high food prices is to increase supply the most realistic way is to replicate the brazilian model of large technologically sophisticated agro companies that supply the world market there are still many areas of the world including large swaths of africa that have good land that could be used far more productively if it were properly managed by large companies to contain the rise in food prices we need more globalisation not less unfortunately large scale commercial agriculture is deeply perhaps irredeemably unromantic we laud the production style of the peasant environmentally sustainable and human in scale in respect of manufacturing we grew out of this fantasy years ago but in agriculture it continues to contaminate our policies in europe and japan huge public resources have been devoted to propping up small farms the best that can be said for these policies is that we can afford them in africa which cannot afford such policies the world bank and the department for international development have orientated their entire efforts on agricultural development to peasant style production africa has less large scale commercial agriculture than it had 60 years ago unfortunately peasant farming is not well suited to innovation and investment the result has been that african agriculture has fallen farther and farther behind
8661485 starvation is the characteristic of some people not having enough to eat it is not the characteristic of there not being enough to eat
8661486 its hard for me not to put academics at the top of the list
8661487 needs to be a team builder needs to bring a lot of constituents to the table
8661488 all of those folks need to come to the table
8661489 weve done too much in richmond in my view from the pulpit
8661490 dr jewell sherman was a pretty good instructional person and they just beat her to death
8661491 there is a need for a singular individual who is recognized as the voice of the school system
8661492 sure they report to the board but that individual in my opinion should be bigger than the board
8661493 its only in richmond where when there is a fight at a school you see board members on tv if a bus driver is found to have a suspended license you see a board member on tv if work permits arent going in fast enough you see board members quoted in the paper you never see that anywhere else
8661494 needs to be just very in tune with the pulse of the community
8661495 not that dr jewell sherman was not out there dealing with that but i think that is just paramount because of where things have gone and how hyper political things have gotten of late
8661496 needs to have the unfettered support of the business community
8661497 i would say everyone over 50 thinks they understand poverty particularly african americans who think they understand poverty because they all say oh we were poor too
8661498 they dont understand what it is and they dont understand the challenges these children face and the walls they have to climb just to be there
8661499 people talk about truancy and graduation rates and those things
8661500 you know the two biggest factors affecting graduation rates in richmond public schools are incarceration and pregnancy
8661501 we need to move from a culture of blame to a culture of learning i dont know if the people in this city are quite ready for that it seems to me that the culture of blame works just fine for them thats unfortunate but i can definitely say i feel that the board and whoever the next superintendent is will have to embrace that culture of learning in order to make a better school system for us all
8661502 the market is quite active the entire property market is built on confidence and people have to decide whether to borrow or use their own capital that confidence is knocked at the moment
8661503 we like to provide as many services as possible for free
8661504 they are mutually claiming the other side started it at the moment its very difficult to confirm who has started it
8661505 we explained that we want dialogue to end this fight
8661506 its not true that were breaking the ceasefire theyre trying to lie because they want war when theyre fighting us how can we disarm
8661507 prescheduled meeting aimed at discussing security matters at strategic level the discussion was held in an open and cordial manner
8661508 im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8661509 thats not the question on voters minds i think theyre much more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives
8661510 sinto me dignificada por terminar a minha carreira ao servi o da l ngua e da cultura portuguesa numa institui o de reconhecido renome com uma rela o pr xima com as diversas inst ncias nacionais e internacionais e com uma equipa de grande compet ncia e dedica o
8661511 but at the end of the day it s a business and sometimes you ve gotta go in there and you shake hands they ve been on each other for free in training i can just tell you that it would really have to be something that makes sense for both guys
8661512 it is appropriate given abramoffs extraordinary cooperation to date cooperation which can be wholly or partially credited for the convictions of a member of congress five high level legislative branch officials one high level executive branch official and two other mid to low level public officials
8661513 assisted with the governments investigation of scores of other persons who have not yet been charged
8661514 hoy nos ha recibido en su suite del hyatt el ex presidente jimmy carter

8661516 helped make personal computers as easy to use as telephones changed the way animated films are made persuaded consumers to tune into digital music and refashioned the mobile phone
8661517 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
8661518 we are close to a serious conflict u s and nato preparations on a strategic scale are ongoing in the operation the west conducted on georgian soil against russia south ossetians were the victims or hostages of it we can see a rehearsal for an attack on iran
8661519 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8661520 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8661521 in light of the build up of nato naval forces in the black sea our fleet has also taken on the task of monitoring their activities
8661522 can nato indefinitely build up its forces and means there it turns out it cannot
8661523 if i leave georgia the russians will close our airspace and prevent me from returning home
8661524 we are close to a serious conflict u s and nato preparations on a strategic scale are ongoing in the operation the west conducted on georgian soil against russia south ossetians were the victims or hostages of it we can see a rehearsal for an attack on iran
8661525 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8661526 dinesh dsouza on atheism his debate with christopher hitchens and his book whats so great about christianity
8661527 i got a call from the minister of defense that russian tanks some 200 were massing to enter tskhinvali from north ossetia
8661528 i ignored it at first but reports kept coming in that they had begun to move forward in fact they had mobilized reserves several days ahead of time
8661529 that theyd been called up three days before from places like moscow we had intelligence coming in ahead of time but we just couldnt believe it also in recent weeks the separatists had intensified artillery barrages and were shooting our soldiers id kept telling our guys to stay calm actually we had most of our troops down near abkhazia where we expected the real trouble to start i can tell you that if wed intended to attack wed have withdrawn our best trained forces from iraq up front
8661530 los argentinos sufrimos el asalto de los subversivos marxistas por orden y cuenta de la uni n sovi tica

8661535 while were not out of the woods yet maybe were beginning to see some sunlight
8661536 at some point the market will begin to look through the trough and gauge the strength of the coming upturn
8661537 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8661538 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas
8661539 but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8661540 lo que cambia la historia son los hechos las obras esa es la verdadera pol tica
8661541 el car cter y el impacto econ mico para la calidad de vida de la gente y el car cter federal que tiene

8661554 le tengo que agradecer a todos por tanto cari o por tanto afecto
8661555 no debe caer en la responsabilidad de reemplazarme a m
8661556 eso no lo tiene que sentir hay que dejarlo que haga las cosas como las viene haciendo lo mismo que ricardo noir si le toca a l pero creo que las condiciones las tiene
8661557 pero hoy por hoy las chances las tienen los chicos que est n ac sabiendo que yo no les voy a exigir nada
8661558 quiero que jueguen con mucha tranquilidad que lo disfruten porque es muy lindo ponerse la camiseta de boca y salir a una bombonera como salieron anoche y festejar un t tulo entonces deseo que disfruten mucho este momento
8661559 este es el momento para ellos no tienen que desaprovechar esta circunstancia y si no trajeron ning n jugador es porque conf an plenamente en ellos y tenemos que apoyarlos
8661560 tomen con tranquilidad la oportunidad que tienen y sepan aprovecharla y saben que si est n dentro del plantel de boca es por algo

8661564 people are trying to understand a game thats inherently interactive by watching a video all i can say is try the demo
8661565 theres glitches in all games its really interesting to me because as an example theres gonna be things you can always improve to me framerates not really that essential in cutscenes and it never has been for us i dont think too humans inconsistent from any of our previous games so theres clipping oh noes bottom line is does it affect gameplay and by how much are there ways to improve too human for sure but the overall big picture happy extremely happy
8661566 if its a sign that people love the game so much that they just want to get back in and play could we make it skippable sure its an easy change is it something we ever would have anticipated since we thought it was faster than going to get your body or losing experience which does not happen in too human is that a change we can make in the future sure
8661567 has refused to cooperate with the government and recall the products
8661568 sfca maintains that it is not responsible for products previously manufactured by simplicity inc
8661569 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8661570 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity
8661571 relying exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts
8661572 the appropriate sides to resolve the existing problems through peaceful dialogue and apply efforts to reconciliation and promotion of negotiations
8661573 the sco member states welcome the adoption in moscow on aug 12 2008 of the six principles of resolving the conflict in south ossetia and support the active role of russia in promoting peace and cooperation in the given region
8661574 serious signal for those are trying to justify the aggression
8661575 the soviet union was not so alone even in 1968
8661576 as of now we can say with confidence that in both regions abkhazia and ossetia ethnic cleansing is fully completed
8661577 theyve expelled from all villages remnants of the georgian population theyve destroyed their houses theyve looted their property theyve burned down their fields forests
8661578 its a huge issue its at least as big an issue as the dns issue if not bigger everyone has assumed until now that you have to break something for a hijack to be useful
8661579 when you look at the other strikers who have been moving around you are talking about gorka being worth between 4million 5million 6million and 7million
8661580 gorka is the type of striker that is the hardest to find and thats the value in the british market
8661581 rob edwards will be captain for the rest of the season now when he plays and shaun will be the vice captain and club captain
8661582 i am delighted to get it all sorted and get it out of the way
8661583 if anyone doubts my motivation they can be sure of this i want to win now more than ever
8661584 maybe the result was a bit unfair but after all thats life
8661585 we should have had a penalty in the first half and then we were done by an own goal and there was another deflection right at the end as well
8661586 theyre good players but they are similar to players we already have in our squad
8661587 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8661588 i played with gary and i know what hes like and how he works
8661589 i could have stayed down south but when gary asked me if i wanted to join up for training in pre season it was a massive incentive for me
8661590 its going to be a tough match obviously we havent won a game yet and theyve won every league game so far
8661591 they have by far the best squad in the championship but were due a win and you could say theyre due a defeat
8661592 the appearance of nato battleships here in the black sea basin and the decision to deliver humanitarian aid to georgia using nato battleships is something that can hardly be explained
8661593 let us hope that we do not see any direct confrontation
8661594 there is certainly no nato build up in the black sea
8661595 concerned about the latest changes in south ossetia and abkhazia
8661596 i will declare your lack of passion for me non canon
8661597 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8661598 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8661599 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8661600 weve had two powerful women speak back to back on each night michelle obama and hillary clinton
8661601 this has been a joy we didnt make it but boy did we have a good time trying
8661602 we will leave denver united my goal is that we win in november

8661605 the suicide bombings are permitted the victims are considered to have died a martyrs death
8661606 dont ever worry about money because saudi arabias money is your money
8661607 some money from saudi private charities had gone toward funding militants in iraq
8661608 we do not allow funding to go from saudi arabia to hamas

8661617 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8661618 as gadgets get smaller the tradeoffs become more difficult the balance becomes more critical and theres less room for error
8661619 im not surprised its happening to the nano because thats the small one youre asking it do a lot in a very very small package and thats pushing the envelope
8661620 when you have a constant change in the devices i think you have less room to prove designs
8661621 thats more of an issue especially with portable devices because the changes are not let me move this from there the changes are always radical
8661622 what were noticing now is less the idea of miniaturization but more so the idea of lifestyle optimization
8661623 right now were at the point where technology can be more or less be any size the focus is miniaturization in just the right spot to hit the perfect balance between comfortable interaction and pocketability
8661624 anything that is new definitely opens itself up to more risk but without risk theres no reward

8661637 rabi juan manuel hola candy pues s te perdiste de algo jeje en esta clase expl
8661638 laughed at the suggestion and certainly did not call mccain on it
8661639 the major thing standing in the way of a lieberman vice presidential pick for mccain is a seemingly small thing an rnc rule that states that a vice presidential nominee must have been a republican for at least 60 days prior to nomination there are only two ways around that rule as far as i know the first being that lieberman has already switched his party affiliation a couple months ago secretly without letting anybody know highly highly highly unlikely the other option would be for the delegates to vote to waive that rule at the rnc and its not hard to imagine how that would go color me skeptical but i just dont think john mccain would put the party through that kind of turmoil just to get a liberal democratic candidate who already failed twice in running for the white house on a republican ticket

8661658 weve been able to win the last couple of weeks by sitting back and swinging the bat today we werent swinging the bats very well so we were able to play a little bit different game and it ended up working out for us

8661663 and kevin wright has a lot to do with that

8661691 i would rather see some sweet spattering gore as long as its in a good anime than watch a bunch of underage nekomimi cavort around in their underpants for 24 minutes a week while pretending to be airplanes

8661694 we will capture a generation of new voters with an obama victory
8661695 we could be the majority in the senate and house of representatives for the next 40 years if we were to accomplish that we believe in the promise of america and obama makes such a change from what we have now in that regard

8661713 even though the use of statin therapy in elderly patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis has increased substantially during the past decade our study showed many patients remain untreated
8661714 this was especially evident in patients with cvd and pad with data from january to march in 2004 that indicated that less than 50 percent of these patients were on statins
8661715 our findings highlight the treatment care gaps in patients with atherosclerosis and may be useful for guiding medical interventions focusing continuing medical education programs encouraging active discussions on risk reduction therapies at scientific meetings and other educational outreach programs that aim to bring physicians practice into agreement with current guidelines for cardiovascular risk reduction

8661720 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market

8661722 further compound their already increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease
8661723 represent conditions that are major precursors of congestive heart failure
8661724 we reported in the journal diabetes care in june 2007 that thiazolidinediones doubled the risk of congestive heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes
8661725 the increased heart failure appears to be a class effect
8661726 the unfavorable findings from the three trials have not been fully realized by the medical community
8661727 safer cheaper and more effective treatment alternatives are available that do not carry these negative cardiovascular risks in patients with diabetes the rationale for the use of the thiazolidinediones is unclear

8661734 the continuous sharp decline in share prices can have implications for the wider financial system
8661735 with this in mind the board decided to place a floor based on closing prices of securities on wednesday
8661736 the individual security prices will remain free to trade within the normal circuit breaker limits but not below the floor price level as mentioned
8661737 its going to be a good news at least for a short time because the market was constantly going down
8661738 in the meantime the authorities should work on long term measures to boost sentiment perhaps they should have done it earlier
8661739 i think the advent of the storm has been fully priced into the market technically were in a good resistance band here just between 119 50 and 120 a breakthrough of that i think is going to lead to 120 and then beyond that to 125 but then again theres a lot of time between now and when the actual damage from the storm if any becomes known and thats really whats going to push the market higher

8661743 consumers at least are certainly in a very weakened state and thats going to be evident in the data going forward were not going to get as much help from exports down the road either
8661744 the market is gaining increasing confidence the strain in the financial markets and high oil prices will not tip the economy into a recession

8661746 but we are almost two thirds of the way through the third quarter and the focus of attention is now on the future not the past that does not look to be quite as good as what we had in the spring but not terrible either
8661747 id rather not answer any of the stuff relating to that right now

8661869 i would say in general in this area the nhs care is absolutely excellent and the primary care trusts which are responsible for spending that money make hard decisions all the time

8662067 our site at bellevue is geologically and logistically very good and is at the overlap of three of the seismic lines that define the closure of the huge bellevue anticline we will spud in the jurassic dolerite which provides a thick and effective regional seal under the dolerite it is anticipated that we will intersect eight potential reservoir formations these include triassic and permian freshwater sandstones and associated coal measures which are closely analogous to producing reservoirs in the cooper basin australia and in the south oman basin oman we plan to carry out flow tests on the coal and sands for oil and gas beneath the permian sands we expect 150 meters of early permian quamby mudstone that is similar to the sprayberry formation in west texas the quamby formation contains the tasmanite oil shale which is the world standard for type 1 kerogen and one of the richest oil source rocks for oil in the world based on geochemical data government geologists have calculated that the tasmanite oil shale and the quamby formation could have generated 9 5 barrels per square meter of basin area or over 150 billion barrels of oil over the whole tasmania basin even if only 1 of this has been trapped and is recoverable we still have a very significant prospective resource of over 1 billion barrels unconformably beneath this permian section we have potential reservoirs and seals in the siluro devonian eldon group which group is analogous to similar sequences in the appalachians at about 2700 meters we expect to test the gordon limestone which is analogous to producing reservoirs in the amadeus basin in central australia the trenton and viola formations of the usa and the ordovician limestones of the tarim basin china after drilling mud logging flow testing and wireline logging is finished we plan a borehole seismic survey which will for the first time give us accurate velocity information for the early paleozoic sequence and provide an ideal seismic trace at the well bore to correlate with the surface seismic these new data will be very helpful for our ongoing seismic exploration in tasmania work on permitting and engineering planning for our next well thunderbolt 1 which is also on a huge independently verified seismically defined structure is also almost complete and will be submitted shortly

8662081 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
8662082 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8662083 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo

8662095 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8662096 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8662097 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

8662185 medvedevs unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8662186 it is not just the end of the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe it is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law
8662187 we dont want a new cold war he has a big responsibility not to start one
8662188 my visit is designed to send a simple message we have not forgotten our commitments to you
8662189 over georgia russia has moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so in between it signed a ceasefire agreement which included international mediation as the way forward if her word is not her bond then she will not be trusted by anyone russia needs to ask itself about the relationship between short term military victories and longer term economic prosperity
8662190 europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like russia
8662191 must not learn the wrong lessons from the georgia crisis there can be no going back on fundamental principles of territorial integrity democratic governance and international law
8662192 russia is too enmeshed in the world economy it would be counterproductive
8662193 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8662194 there will always be foreign players and coaches and we dont have an issue with that if theyre of high quality
8662195 what we do have an issue with is the run of the mill foreign player who is standing in the way of the development of some very good english youngsters
8662196 the balance is shifting back to english players now and thats something we need to protect because long term if that starts to fall then were in trouble
8662197 if you dont have the number of players coming through the english system that are qualified then that will affect the performance of the england team
8662198 theres no doubt about that and were seeing it happen in football
8662199 in time the scheme will have the desired affect because you will have chief executives looking at the figures and asking why arent their academies producing good quality players
8662200 clubs such as wasps and leicester have seen the benefits of relying on english qualified players while gloucester and harlequins are moving in that direction
8662201 if you rely too much on foreign players who come for the money they will take the money and go two years down the line but what have they left behind
8662202 thats one of the big lessons the clubs have learnt over the last five years
8662203 we need to work with the schools clubs and academies because if were providing better qualified english players the clubs will benefit
8662204 they will benefit because the players are cheaper initially but those players are also generally very loyal driving a culture within a club like weve seen at leicester and wasps
8662205 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

8662207 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8662208 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8662209 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8662210 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8662211 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8662212 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8662213 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8662214 my roomate in flight school is on that wall along with a number of friends who went over there bobby leadbetter for instance we had a going away party for him at my house before he left and three weeks later he was dead so this is how we all come to closure with the vietnam war

8662222 right now its the middle of the day and i just got a report that 875 of the 1 000 bikes are out
8662223 has changed dramatically in the last three days not only have we put 1 000 bikes on the road but the whole scene is different the safety in numbers thing is totally happening
8662224 weve got groups of people riding and were taking them out on five lane highways hardly what id call a bike friendly situation but were just taking up the whole lane and its working out great
8662225 just help cars knows that there will be bikes in the same lane with them and it shows that bikes can take the lane here so theyre not in the door zone a lot of these sharrow markings were put down specifically so that people will be safe
8662226 i think weve seen some improvements not just with infrastructure but in attitude change as well
8662227 were now going for a collective shared goal of 10 000 rides and 25 000 miles
8662228 humana has seen what has happened in paris with velib their highly successful bike sharing program and theyve had such a good experience with this

8662231 i truly believe that people like myself who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight should keep their mouth shut on politics
8662232 im good at writing songs and singing what im not educated in is the field of political science and so for me to be sharing my views and influencing people of who i think they should be voting for i think would be very irresponsible on my part

8662238 the pqri is a substantial effort on the part of medicare to move towards rewarding physicians for providing top quality care
8662239 allowing physicians to use their dprp data to satisfy the programs reporting requirements allow doctors to spend less time preparing reports and more time doing what they love caring for patients
8662240 when the american diabetes association first developed the dprp it was a unique program for physicians to be recognized for providing quality care its gratifying to see how the program has expanded so much in the partnership with ncqa and that now cms has has designated the dprp as a registry for quality reporting

8662248 this just isnt good enough the housing market is in a very serious position and we need serious action the figures show that it is agents and consumers that are bearing the brunt of this indecision and whilst we need a planned and managed response from the government we also need it quickly
8662249 i will never forget the parents of children with autism and other severe conditions who told me on the campaign trail that they couldnt afford health care and couldnt qualify their kids for medicaid unless they quit work or got a divorce

8662315 stuart and i signed up for the challenge in january and then barbara decided to join us barbara has cycled for a while but weve just got into road cycling we went on holiday to italy got on road bikes there and fell in love with it
8662316 we discovered roads we had never been on in our lives before and were all born and bred in sutherland
8662317 wed go out three or four times a week and cover around 30 miles each time the longest we did was over 100 miles we would usually devote our whole weekend to training and try to get in two long runs back to back
8662318 it was exceedingly windy the whole of may and june and we just longed for a west wind to blow us home but we always seemed to be going into an east wind
8662319 we did stop at every coffee shop available and became very well known
8662320 on the saturday morning the level of excitement was incredible as we were heading for paris and our goal of the eiffel tower we gathered in a park on the outskirts of the city where we donned our macmillan t shirts and rode en masse towards the arc de triomphe
8662321 it was the most unbelievable experience as cars tooted and pedestrians cheered although we think some of them thought that we were the tour de france a week early
8662322 at the eiffel tower many of the group had family and friends waiting to meet them and many tears were shed in the jubilation of completing nearly 300 miles
8662323 that evening we had a gala dinner and were all presented with a commemorative t shirt celebrations continued long into the night and for some into the morning
8662324 not much sightseeing was done in paris and it was a very subdued but proud group that boarded the eurostar that afternoon back to london saying farewell at st pancras station was very emotional
8662325 weve so many people to thank for their support whether through sponsorship buying and selling quiz sheets supporting raffles maintaining our bikes lending us bike bags or just generally encouraging us

8662333 theres an awful lot of bad feeling in brora about these large transport vehicles going across the bridge and down victoria road
8662334 right from the start i have felt there is an obvious solution and that is to extend the road put in place for the kilbraur wind farm it is in the hands of sse and the landowner it is common sense and i would urge golspie and brora community councils to encourage sse to recognise the unacceptability of the trunk road proposal
8662335 were not going to sit back and just take it all
8662336 we have got the co operation of some of the landowners but we have not been able to secure the co operation of all of them although there is no dispute
8662337 it would be wrong to suggest it was just down to one particular reason it is a combination of reasons that has made the kilbraur route not feasible for us
8662338 this isnt something that we have just looked at and not taken seriously we have seriously looked at the alternative options but have concluded that the strath brora route is the best option
8662339 we dont want to fly in the face of local communities views but we would like to think they would consider sse as a responsible company that has looked at all the choices and come up with the most feasible one
8662340 were disappointed that we do not seem able to communicate to local people why we have come to the conclusion that is the best road we want to continue discussions with local people and we understand their concerns

8662379 my family were going north long before i was born and were pretty adventurous they pulled a caravan the 270 miles from edinburgh to balnakeil farm at durness way before the bridges over kylesku kessock and the forth were built
8662380 these first journeys took over 12 hours to tackle and on the struie my folks had to get out of the car on the sharpest narrowest bends and actually manoeuvre the caravan by hand
8662381 back then it was so unusual to see other cars on the road that two vehicles meeting would often stop and exchange a greeting
8662382 when i was eight we rented our first static caravan from wilma ross at badcall inchard kinlochbervie
8662383 during family holidays we made so many craft items for the missions sale of work that we gained the nickname the stone people it was laughingly said that if all the painted paperweights we had produced were taken out of local homes and placed together we could have built the highland home we always dreamed of

8662424 from natural energizers like omega 3s or antioxidants to foods that are fortified with energizing ingredients we are seeing energy to emerge as a core benefit in new food products
8662425 this trend shows that consumers may be distinguishing between somewhat unhealthy stimulants which they desire and high sugar content in drinks which they do not

8662444 even if the victim in a given case has been promiscuous in her sexual behaviour earlier she has a right to refuse to submit herself to sexual intercourse to anyone and everyone because she is not a vulnerable object or prey for being sexually assaulted by anyone and everyone
8662445 even if it is hypothetically accepted that the victim had lost her virginity earlier it did not and cannot in law give licence to any person to rape her
8662446 on the contrary the question which was required to be adjudicated was did the accused commit rape on the victim on the occasion complained of it is the accused who was on trial and not the victim

8662455 when people see me dressed normally they cant believe it its really weird but if i didnt have a sexy side i wouldnt have done
8662456 i had a feeling of shock then relief that someone with integrity had received it and had made the effort to pursue it rather than dump the document in the bin or didnt seek to abuse the information in any way
8662457 she contacted the ird then tried to track us down which shows a lot of integrity it was a matter of luck really because it could have easily got into the wrong hands
8662458 its really the collection of it all together thats dangerous your employer ird number its all on one bit of paper and it could pose a considerable risk if it got into the wrong hands
8662459 they were just like oh well just mail them back the woman on the phone talked to me like i was stupid and like why was i complaining i told them i was disgusted and its not like new world coupons you are handing out i was just disgusted with the lack of caring
8662460 i told them i would drop them back after contacting the people involved then she was very apologetic
8662461 from time to time we do make a mistake we understand that such mistakes can be very upsetting and we sincerely apologise to people who may be affected

8662463 the crusaders along with the new zealand rugby union have said that i can still help out to some degree
8662464 but thats probably only one day a week with the tasman side
8662465 ill be helping them out as much as i can along with fulfilling my crusaders duties
8662466 ive been focusing on tasman and then the crusaders but as of next week i will focus on both roles
8662467 its been in the back of a few minds theres no doubt about that
8662468 but when weve been together as a team the guys have really been focusing well on their rugby but theres always that underlying sense of anxiety
8662469 you just have to say to them what are you doing for next season and obviously theyre looking to their future it hasnt been easy for our guys and weve just had to focus on our rugby as much as we can and in some ways the rugby has been a really nice distraction
8662470 its been a busy time personally let alone having the distraction of coaching a side thats about to be exited at the end of the year
8662471 its been quite a challenge but all in all rugby is rugby and i absolutely love it and live for it
8662472 i think the set piece is massive and canterbury have got such a good set piece ive had a good look at their lineout and theyve absolutely dominated that area so far in the npc and thats going to be a real challenge for us
8662473 itll help us sell a hell of a lot more xero licences and it will help sell more acclipse licences and all of us will have a much better relationship with all our clients its one of those true win win type deals
8662474 each accountant works with hundreds of small businesses so its a very leveraged opportunity for us
8662475 acclipse shares our vision of making it easier for small businesses to be successful and empowering accountants to be the trusted adviser to small business
8662476 your men and women have gained the respect and admiration of our people
8662477 they are neutral friendly and always willing to lend a hand in our communities
8662478 on behalf of my people and my government prime minister we thank you very very much because we know you are a friend and new zealanders are also very good friends of timor leste
8662479 while we are taking care of our two fragile institutions we are still in need
8662480 by next year we hope we can say it is already time to say thanks once again to the australian and new zealand troops
8662481 it is certainly our desire not to be there for the long term but to provide the support and the mentoring and the community policing models

8662485 when you get onto retail shelves and you return a high rate of sale big retailers embrace you because youre the brand that generates them the most gross profit margin
8662486 i have sufficient information that gives me reason to suspect that an investigation may reveal serious and complex fraud
8662487 on the information currently to hand there are serious questions whether donations intended for one purpose may have been put to a different purpose
8662488 the allegations concern important matters relating to the funding of a political party which go to the heart of the democratic process and involve a minister in the government
8662489 probably all media think now why did we not ask
8662490 in my view hes not fit to be the foreign minister helen clark should act and she should act decisively to stand him down
8662491 if they had the courtesy to talk to me this matter would have been cleared up in a few minutes
8662492 they did not even have the courtesy to tell me about their decision i heard it on the radio
8662493 thatll be 250 by the end of the day people are coming out in their droves we are processing 100 to 150 calls a day for an alternative and we are getting faxed to us 50 to 70 prescriptions a day from all over the country

8662499 the allegations concern important matters relating to the funding of a political party which go to the heart of the democratic process and involve a minister in the government
8662500 probably all media think now why did we not ask
8662501 in my view hes not fit to be the foreign minister helen clark should act and she should act decisively to stand him down
8662502 if they had the courtesy to talk to me this matter would have been cleared up in a few minutes
8662503 they did not even have the courtesy to tell me about their decision i heard it on the radio
8662504 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning
8662505 even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making

8662508 effectively the nzru will be paying for the players payments
8662509 if we didnt they would not have been able to carry on and we would have been up for that amount to pay the players anyway
8662510 we dont want the competition to be disrupted and tasman if it withdrew could have impacted on other provincial unions
8662511 we are seeking further information before we think about challenging the nzru

8662537 its like you see someone opposite of you with their head on the pillow we see our lovers and our children in that pose they look like the heads of fallen statues and they afford the viewer an intimate look at the face of the young person whose life is at risk and that was the point
8662538 when you see soldiers on the news you have no idea who they are theyre representing the united states and they have all that gear on i wanted to get past all that
8662539 we understand that soldier represents a political art project and that the individuals depicted are actual soldiers
8662540 out of context neither in a museum setting or website the images as stand alone highway or city billboards appear to be deceased soldiers the presentation in this manner could be perceived as being disrespectful to the men and women in our armed forces
8662541 how the image would be perceived by a motorist passing it in transit
8662542 its not a strong advocacy for any partisan point of view we dont see soldiers in this very individualised human way in the press or media in this country a soldier is one thing theyre in camouflage holding a rifle here theyre individuals with personalities

8662664 the wide range of topics is truly amazing from teaching a language or reviewing online education tools to writing a public diary sharing the foreign language learning process
8662665 whereas blogging is considered mainstream in the us by now many language enthusiasts around the world are only recently discovering the possibilities of the web

8662677 public health training can better prepare these students for many of the issues they will be facing in medicine
8662678 for example with elderly patients it isnt enough just to treat their bodies you need to know where they live their family situation and so many other pieces of information that impact their health well beyond the aspects of medicine

8662697 dont tell him i said this but he is an impressive fellow in many ways
8662698 just as everyone else did back home only perhaps even more uncertain and alarmed for my country in the darkness that was then enclosed around me and my fellow captives
8662699 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend

8662704 were not getting what we need to from everybody that we expected if i knew why then i would have fixed it unfortunately its my job to put it together and fix whats broken i havent been able to figure that out if i could have i would have by now

8662715 although one of the works did contain plaintiffs trademark several minutes into the clip there is no evidence from which it can be inferred that veoh was aware of but chose to ignore it nor is this court convinced that the professionally created nature of submitted content constitutes a per se red flag of infringement sufficient to impute the requisite level of knowledge or awareness to veoh indeed with the video equipment available to the general public today there may be little if any distinction between professional and amateur productions
8662716 no reasonable juror could conclude that a comprehensive review of every file would be feasible the plaintiffs suggestion that veoh must be required to reduce or limit its business operations to filter content is contrary to one of the stated goals of the dmca the dmca was intended to facilitate growth of electronic commerce not squelch it
8662717 senator obamas speech tonight will be as he himself has characterized it more workmanlike a very direct conversation with the american people about the choice we face in this election about the risk of staying on the same path were on the risk of just more of the same versus the change we need

8662861 as we all know american muslims are a small but growing minority within america with estimates ranging from 1 to 2 5 of the total population this fact screams for the need of building alliances if we as a community can mentally separate human rights principles from the legal case we would then have a host of potential allies we can identify and work with groups that oppose torture stand up for due process and stand against the deterioration of other constitutional rights this allows us to build broad based coalitions that are hard to attack when a cross segment of americans stand together it affirms the validity of the cause when a minority group stands alone it is seen as a special interest
8662862 perish in you rage allah knoweth well all the secrets of the heart
8662863 while we each consider dr aafia siddiquis case it should be stated very clearly that conspiratorial and anti american rhetoric withdrawal from society and other deconstructive responses all serve to separate us from our potential allies those responses will empower both the anti islamic xenophobes along with their counterparts the terrorists
8662864 our lord rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors and raise for us from thee one who will protect and raise for us from thee one who will help
8662865 today as the grassroots responses are forming it is essential that we remember the need to create lasting relationships with others who share our universal values as individuals and as a community we have to find opportunities to build relationships relationships with non muslims that are truly win win obviously these relationships have to be maintained and reciprocated otherwise what we really end up doing is to burn bridges
8662866 the need to create lasting relationships with others who share our universal values

8662869 there is a lot of talk about an impending federal election if you are one of the countless canadians who wants an answer to why working people dont get their priorities dealt with why good jobs are not being protected why theres still a shortage of affordable child care and why women still earn just 701 2 cents for every dollar men get when they work think about who you need to elect to finally make your priorities the priorities of your government

8662875 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change
8662876 they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programs to encourage and support behaviour change

8662901 with this in mind and if prospects for the new company are confirmed air france klm is ready to take a minority stake in the capital of the new company alongside the investors gathered together by italian bank intesa sanpaolo
8662902 we received the information from the italian authorities in the form of a draft text for the privatisation plans for alitalia
8662903 at this stage it would be quite unwise to make any substantive comments on the text itself

8662941 abortion is still a hush hush issue in kenya but despite laws which restrict the termination of pregnancy illegal abortion continues in this east african nation unabated there are no easy answers to this emotive issue on the one side there are those who argue for the womans right to choose to have a baby or not while others using religion as the base argue for the rights of the fetus
8662942 kenyan doctors often take a very liberal approach to the interpretation of kenyas restrictive abortion policy with the knowledge that if they do not women will be forced to conduct unsafe abortions that place their lives at higher risk
8662943 kenya has one of the most restrictive abortion laws even as the rest of the world relaxes those laws yet abortion rates are increasing and becoming more dangerous as women take greater risks to complete their abortions a visit to ward 1d in kenya where women end after botched abortions is a sobering evidence of this im sure that there are legitimate reasons for restricting abortion the thing i dont understand is the hypocrisy by the government on this issue given these sobering statistics did you know that a person found helping to complete an abortion in kenya can be subject to capital punishment what about the men who forcibly rape young girls relatives and mentally retarded women all over the country
8662944 abortion in our country kenya is a never ending story first you have the police going after doctors who allegedly have performed the vice being imprisoned however the solution to the problem in my opinion is not to go after the doctors after all they are trying to get a sense of livelihood though through the wrong means as such i would go for pro life and pro choice let the pregnant couple decide what to do about their situation this will only be possible if abortion is legalised in kenya
8662945 the bill if passed will promote and allow easy access to abortion on demand with virtually no safeguards to protect unborn children under the subtle guise of reproductive rights language the bill declares safe and accessible abortion related care as a reproductive right abortion can be permitted provided that the continued pregnancy would pose a risk of injury to the womans physical or mental health this will in effect allow abortions on demand

8662951 there is going to be a front moving across taranaki on wednesday
8662952 but it is possible it might wait until thursday to rain
8662953 spring should bring a return to normal conditions not too wet or dry there are no big reasons to expect anything else
8662954 with the heaviest rain months now behind us september should be a drier cooler and sunnier month
8662955 we were a bit worried about getting daffodils this year because of the bad weather but we were very lucky we got most of them from palmerston north and from local farmers
8662956 like everyone else our costs have continued to rise so we hope we can reach our target of 130 000
8662957 we have 12 people participating in the 197km ride it is not the usual ride around the mountain as we are stopping off at waitara as well

8662959 it is not always the parents fault the laws are not in the 21st century they are still lost in the dark ages
8662960 new zealand law needs to look at that we need to look at making young people some who are near to voting age accountable for their crimes
8662961 they shouldnt dump the responsibility on parents they are disempowering parents thats whats happening if a child refuses to go to school it is the child who is breaking the law
8662962 what they do now affects them for their future they have all the power in the world now they cant arrive in the future and blame anyone but themselves
8662963 young people get in to drugs girls have babies they think the easy way out is going on to the dpb
8662964 at the end of the day it is the parents job to enforce the law
8662965 it is our role to prosecute parents as is the current law
8662966 im so delighted to see the back of patsy and kevins appointment is a bit left field but it is interesting so we look forward to discussion with the board about the rationale for this

8662970 it mostly just gave us a bit of a fright
8662971 no one was expecting it because we take the bus every day
8662972 its a bit of a trial first up for everyone involved
8662973 were starting with a small group of 20 boys and see where we go from there
8662974 what were trying to do is give them a taste of what its like to be a professional rugby player or show them what is required to be a rep player
8662975 were putting a bit of pressure on them to become role models within the school and within the community
8662976 we have to raise the bar and play with a lot of enthusiasm a lot of ticker if we are to come away with a win
8662977 northland will obviously be hurting a little with the threat of relegation theyve got a lot to play for and it will be a good battle
8662978 we have to concentrate on our own game and discipline will be key its important we eliminate mistakes and penalties especially when we make it into the pay zone the opposition 22
8662979 you cant afford to turn the ball over like we did against canterbury and its something weve talked about we have to keep the foot on the throat and eliminate mistakes turnovers kill you
8662980 i like the history of them the romance of it you can go into a supermarket and buy a fuji or a gala apple but they are not the same as an egremont russet or a bella scarletta they are just beautiful names plus they are just like old roses to grow they are virtually indestructible
8662981 i reckon theres going to be a resurgence of home fruit gardens like vegetables gardens the cost of everythings going through the roof
8662982 theres nothing like picking something out of your garden or digging your own potatoes or picking your own apples
8662983 i dig a big square hole put in some well rotted horse or sheep manure and a handful of blood and bone pop in the tree and thats it i dont spray them apart from copper in winter the old apple trees dont need it
8662984 you have to use the roads and brush your teeth with the councils water but you choose to visit places such as libraries and parks so parks are competing for peoples time and its a huge privilege for us when they come into our parks
8662985 theres a whole resurgence across new zealand in community gardens farmers markets and people wanting to grow and eat fresh food
8662986 im so delighted to see the back of patsy and kevins appointment is a bit left field but it is interesting so we look forward to discussion with the board about the rationale for this
8662987 im happy given that our operating earnings in the key divisions automotive equipment footwear and packaging are relatively strong year on year

8662989 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
8662990 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
8662991 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
8662992 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines
8662993 the court will deny the executives request for a stay
8662994 hence the executive should respond to the document aspect of the subpoenas by producing non privileged material and identifying more specifically the materials it is withholding on a claim of executive privilege
8662995 it is on ms mierss appearance that the dispute principally focuses this decision should not however foreclose the parties continuing attempts to reach a negotiated solution both sides indicated that discussions regarding an accommodation have resumed
8662996 has failed to demonstrate that it has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the absolute immunity issue or that it has even raised a question
8662997 the executives argument boils down to a claim that a stay is appropriate because the underlying issue is important
8662998 but that is beside the point and does not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits simply calling an issue important primarily because it involves the relationship of the political branches does not transform the executives weak arguments into a likelihood of success or a substantial appellate issue hence the court concludes that this prong of the stay pending appeal analysis cuts strongly in favor of the committee
8662999 toward that end and hopefully as a prelude to meaningful discussions between us i propose that members of our respective staffs meet as early as next week to re commence discussing possibilities for reaching an accommodation between the branches in this matter
8663000 as i know you appreciate this litigation is very important in determining constitutional contours governing certain relations between the executive and legislative branches in the congressional oversight setting
8663001 accordingly the department of justice has now filed an appeal in this matter and is also seeking a stay of the decision pending review by the u
8663002 that course of action will provide appellate consideration of the novel questions at stake in this matter and will enable the parties to obtain if it should prove necessary a final decision in this important matter however the fact that the executive has notice an appeal in this matter does not signify that we think further litigation is the exclusive path forward
8663003 represents the best hope of promoting an accommodation between the two branches
8663004 we have not found willing partners on the other side of the table
8663005 had the litigants indicated that a negotiated solution was foreseeable in the near future the court may have stayed its hand in the hope that further intervention in this dispute by the article iii branch would not be necessary
8663006 as it stands however the court must decide the questions presented to it
8663007 todays ruling clearly rejects the white houses efforts to run out the clock on the committees investigation of doj politicization this congress
8663008 i am heartened that judge bates recognized that the public interest in this matter is best served by the furtherance of the committees investigation the committee intends to promptly schedule a hearing with ms miers and stands ready as always to consider any reasonable offer of accommodation with the white house
8663009 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
8663010 in fact there is supreme court authority that is all but conclusive on this question and that powerfully suggests that such advisors do not enjoy absolute immunity
8663011 the aspect of this lawsuit that is unprecedented is the notion that ms miers is absolutely immune from compelled congressional process the supreme court has reserved absolute immunity for very narrow circumstances involving the presidents personal exposure to suits for money damages based on his official conduct or concerning matters of national security or foreign affairs the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law

8663022 we will make of these detainees parasites in their societies and we will not release them until they become like mummies empty and full of holes from inside like swiss cheese
8663023 i was shackled in iron cuffs that entered my flesh and a bag was put on my head as a certain music roared in my ears and almost deafened me they used to beat me up and kick me and my body was full of wounds and bruises after that i was sent to a doctor who asked me if i was tortured and i said yes but he didnt reply or say something then i was taken back and tortured again
8663024 the use of certain interrogation methods by the israel security agency isa involving the use of moderate physical pressure was illegal as it violated constitutional protection of the individuals right of dignity while recognizing the right of israel to protect its citizens from violence it reiterates that no exceptional circumstances may be invoked as justification of torture
8663025 the use of torture in israeli interrogations and works for its complete prohibition
8663026 how common is the phenomenon of beating shackled palestinian prisoners
8663027 unfortunately i want to admit something that we are not fully aware of these cases are not all that exceptional in their quantity to my great regret many of them are not the subject of any complaint and are cloaked in various kinds of conspiracies of silence
8663028 by providing the relevant bodies with useful information and tools
8663029 only metal devices are to be used and the tightening of the shackles should be undertaken to prevent injury to the detainee particularly to blood vessels
8663030 i was put in a small room and they beat my legs they put me on the floor then i felt one of the soldiers take something from the floor and beat me on my head and shoulders then they took me out into a concrete yard and tied my handcuffs to a concrete pole and made me sit on the ground and they beat me every hour or half hour they would beat me on the face

8663034 grave consequences of this action can be anticipated in advance
8663035 how can it be that these events keep repeating themselves and no one is bothered and this is the morality of the idf these are the most basic values to which soldiers should be educated from the start it isnt about palestinians its about normative behavior the most basic things how a soldier in the idf can commit such abusive acts it comes down to some kind of disregard for the lives of palestinians
8663036 criminal phenomenon subject to penalties under an entire system of offenses in israeli criminal law
8663037 given this reality it is hardly surprising that an examination of the actual behavior of the military as distinct from its declarations also reveals denial evasion and obfuscation
8663038 when you deny thousands of people a day free movement it is impossible to do it in a nice way
8663039 tangible objectives for securing a drastic reduction in as short a period of time as possible toward the ultimate goal of completely eradicating this phenomenon high level examination of the problem should be made public shared with commanders and soldiers the media and members of the knesset to send a clear message that this behavior wont be tolerated defense ministry orders directives procedures and guidelines should be established 4 the command and residual responsibility for abusers to avoid the excuse that they cant be located 5 identify weak spots where ill treatment occurs 6 neutralize them by command presence or through a controlled physical space 7 allow no contact between dogs and detainees 8 give special attention to the arrest and detention of minors and 9 define arrest transfer and detention procedures the nature of an

8663045 if there is something all humanity can agree on at least theoretically it is that preserving individual dignity in difficult situations requires that we all conform to some elementary common standards of conduct

8663053 from torture and other forms of ill treatment or punishment may not be violated under any circumstances and states of emergency

8663055 israels sensitivity in dealing with human rights issues and the problem of torture and ill treatment makes any dialogue on these matter particularly slow and complex
8663056 may become overly reluctant to raise such issues systematically consistently and firmly notwithstanding their legal and political duty to put human rights in the centre of their foreign and security policy
8663057 apparently not the subject of torture and ill treatment given the political realities in israel and the opt progress in preventing and eradicating torture and ill treatment must be regarded as a mid and long term goal
8663058 there is never a good moment to raise human rights questions and always a reason for not doing something

8663061 we dont have to travel far and the fixtures have fallen nicely weve got a home game against villarreal inbetween the games against liverpool and chelsea
8663062 i remember the last game at celtic distinctly they beat us to qualify and the atmosphere from their fans was unbelievable they will be two huge games
8663063 being consistent being accurate with the football making good decisions
8663064 hes doing a great job of leading this offense and hes really taken control of the reins
8663065 and i really like the way hes approached it he wants to be the leader of this football team not just this offense but the entire football team
8663066 you are the quarterback and you are in control of the huddle and you are making checks at the line
8663067 this is the wide receivers team this is the offensive lines team this is the running backs team everyone works together and corrects things with each other
8663068 hes a critical thinker i know that from experience because he has beat me twice
8663069 when i came in as a freshman i didnt have a clue
8663070 being a senior and having that maturity i think i have come a long way since my freshman year definitely
8663071 playing a good defense like that and seeing how fast and well coached they were can get a little intimidating
8663072 but it also makes you realize that no one is invincible
8663073 weve got to give him some help weve got to give him help as coaches and the players have to also i dont think well be getting in drop back mode all day with a young quarterback weve got to establish the run and help him out
8663074 guys stepped up and protected him and that allowed some of our receivers to get open and make plays
8663075 when one part does its job its easier for the other parts to look good
8663076 ive told the guys that i know this is my first start but im going to come out and be confident and not get rattled
8663077 weve got all the confidence in the world in him
8663078 it will be a new experience for him even as a young guy hes telling us to run to the ball and get on the line and every play he calls he calls it confidently
8663079 im not trying to be andre woodson or the other guys kentucky has had in the past i dont have to try and make a play every time we have other great athletes who can make plays it might be third and seven or third and eight and we might run the ball and thats ok with our offensive line and running backs i may not have to always make a play on third down
8663080 its easy to stop the run if you get an extra hat down there in the box if they try and get an extra hat down there in the box weve got to throw the football
8663081 i just dont think were as good at running the deep routes as last year i think he can throw the deep ball weve just got to be able to get open and get over the top of some people
8663082 this is why i came here and this is what i want to do hopefully for a long time im confident in myself and our team that we can win this game im not putting any predictions out there but if we come out here play our game and make adjustments we can come out on top
8663083 hes prepared and practiced like a guy who its very important to that he plays well
8663084 when barack obama accepts the democratic nomination to become the president of the united states of america and starts speaking i think all of america and many parts of the world the hopes the longings the aspirations and the dreams will be hanging on every word he says
8663085 its going to be incredible you know people died some people didnt make it to the march on washington they were beaten they were tear gassed some were shot and killed and even after the march on washington where there had been so much hope so much optimism we had to deal with the bombing on a church in birmingham where four little girls were killed but ive cried all my tears
8663086 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal

8663089 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
8663090 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
8663091 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
8663092 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines

8663099 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8663100 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8663101 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8663102 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8663103 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8663162 housing in the u k is becoming a bit of a magical mystery tour to borrow a phrase from the beatles for a month or so we thought the declines in home prices had moderated apparently not
8663163 tighter lending requirements and real concern about the economy have sapped sales and its really showing up in the price data
8663164 the u k did not experience as big a refinancing boom as america did but in almost every other metric the boom was the same we had a classic overbuild of homes a belief that double digit price gains could not end and of course reckless lending

8663166 should push the bank of england in the direction of one perhaps two quarter point interest rate cuts this fall

8663288 theyre aware of this and weve been telling them all along not only are they auditioning for us theyre auditioning for the league thirty one other teams will study their films like we study everybody else in the league and all of their personnel

8663311 a review of 34 studies showed that sedentary individuals who started engaging in physical activity had a more subdued response to stressful situations stressful events didnt upset them as much

8663313 when the first paper came out a lot of people were saying maybe this was a special case maybe this is a little weird
8663314 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8663315 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8663316 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
8663317 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle

8663337 it is not clear whether any order to disperse was given no legal observer sic witness or arreste on the scene weve debriefed heard any order to disperse
8663338 numerous persons including legal observers asked to be able to leave the blockaded area and were refused
8663339 after the arrests attorneys from the peoples law project and the aclu arrived at the temporary arrestee processing site to conduct confidential attorney client consultations
8663340 the city refused to provide any access to allow these persons to meet with attorneys
8663341 i personally saw one such arrestee later at the city and county building i saw her marched from the elevator to the courtroom in bare feet and leg shackles i saw her appear in bare feet and leg shackles
8663342 some arrestees who could not make their own bond spent 6 7 8 or more hours waiting at taps before being transferred to court
8663343 the only access we were given to those clients was to whisper
8663344 attorneys were at the court from 11 pm on the night of aug 25 2008 and were staying until each and every arrestee came to the city and county building
8663345 those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable
8663346 this meant that no one was allowed to make a phone call unless they plead guilty thus making it impossible for arrestees to even call a lawyer until admitting guilt
8663347 id guess that the paper had the ad money for the length of time it did because when the market was booming brokers had the cash to put into advertising that they knew wasnt very effective just because they could it was easier to appease sellers and continue the same old thing because it was less work that educating people about how the marketing paradigm had shifted away from print media now that everyone is watching their wallets much more closely better advertising dollars are spent on being where the customers are
8663348 the macintosh os of today is not the os that i helped write although certainly a lot of its dna is in there
8663349 when the mac came out and for two years thereafter it was at least four or five years ahead of windows and possibly could have taken the place of windows if it was openly licensed
8663350 there are a few elements that were taken directly from the original macintosh that werent present in the next os like the menu bar the original the next os didnt have the menu bar and when they created os x they brought back some original mac elements
8663351 the mac wouldnt have happened without steve jobs doing something as unique and revolutionary as the macintosh is really hard as you can tell by so few things like that ever coming out to the market so it takes a unique individual the mac team was full of unique individuals and steve was one of us steve is steve has his greatness and his flaws like all of us but certainly his values and personality and persistence and determination and powers of persuasion and all the rest of it were a really key ingredient so without steve it would be unimaginably different to me
8663352 steve made zero technical contributions hes not a technical person so sort of his main contribution was setting the goal setting a very high goal and then being really passionate about exceeding the expectations

8663405 a couple of years ago it was in the news saying that barnsley had the ugliest women in england now were being told everyone is fat
8663406 it is extremely unfair barnsley is no worse than any other town or city
8663407 the rationale is that for many years people did heavy manual jobs coupled with a high calorie intake
8663408 this is isnt just a barnsley phenomenon it has happened in other post industrial towns
8663409 however it is a very serious problem here and we recognise that
8663410 we are really pushing physical activity walking clubs have sprung up all over the town and we now have 400 people taking part every month

8663423 a parable is closer to it and a cautionary tale that sort of fits up modern celebrity
8663424 when i started looking into it that wasnt the intention to go so far in the direction of what its like to be turned into a famous person to be a celebrity of sorts i know i wanted to set it in the world of photography i thought the links were very strong there and it would have that contemporary feel
8663425 but the more stories that were coming out about celebrities i thought this is people being put into extraordinary situations and things happen to them things change them and often they can become monsters so it became more and more relevant
8663426 all said they wanted the piece that means theres a future for it
8663427 the thing is i dont see what the obviously do not have a problem with female gamers or female bloggers but i dont understand why some women seem to think this is such important distinction for their blog
8663428 i am a gamer and i happen to be a female so what what exactly is your point
8663429 learned from the past gotten past youthful exuberance settled down and taken to writing well presented thought out reasoned and informative articles
8663430 whats with all the bloggers calling themselves chicks or girls its so not necessary
8663431 just because my toon has a female name doesnt mean im a guy damnit and just because im a woman doesnt mean i cant kick your ass

8663464 government forces attacked all of our positions in rutshuru for months the government has been carrying out maneuvers to prepare this attack
8663465 the other thing i would say about our brands is that they have faced world wars they have faced revolutions they have faced more economic cycles than we will see and they are today faster more profitable and appealing to more customers than ever before
8663466 inevitably the companys outlook for 2009 is rather less bullish and the ongoing rise in commodity costs could yet erode some of its
8663467 nonetheless the company is well positioned to withstand slowing economic growth

8663471 i think we have the vocal leaders the look and all aspects we can ask for from the captains the guys all work well together and the captains help the young guys with the transition into college soccer
8663472 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8663473 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral
8663474 candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote

8663528 racconto il dramma di tre individui nella germania post industriale
8663529 siamo tornati a girare a prignitz nel nord est della germania perch mi interessa molto non solo dal punto di vista sociologico quello che sta accadendo in quella regione dopo che crollato il sogno industriale lisolamento in cui si rinchiudono alcune persone le stesse che poi mi hanno dato ispirazione per la realizzazione del film
8663530 rappresenta una delle possibili conseguenze al giogo psicologico del denaro vero protagonista dellintera vicenda
8663531 venezia ormai per me un appuntamento fisso ma non che pago sottobanco per essere qui piuttosto devo ringraziare gli organizzatori
8663532 dopo il cinema e la televisione ora rifletto sulla mia terza passione professione la produzione artistica
8663533 ho usato i miei quadri come gi in hana bi non sono per niente belli e non piacciono a nessuno ma sono imitazioni di tele famose che non mi sono costate una lira comunque achille e la tartaruga vuole affermare che il successo non serve limportante fare ci che piace io mi ritengo fortunato di poter fare il regista
8663534 non credevo potesse esistere una moglie cos obbediente che segue il marito fino in fondo al baratro ma stato bello interpretarla
8663535 tutti i quadri che vedete nel film li ho richiesti agli amici a cui li avevo regalati non ne ho mai venduto uno se a qualcuno di voi ne piacesse uno pu partecipare alla lotteria sui generis che di solito organizzo per i miei amici fan
8663536 dopo questa trilogia dice il suo fedele produttore masayuki mori mi aspetto da takeshi qualcosa di molto libero e innovativo
8663537 il sacrificio e la morte siano necessari a un artista ma con akires to kame volevo descrivere una storia darte crudele
8663538 le monde est dangereux vivre non pas cause de ceux qui font le mal
8663539 we will soon be ready to answer questions to all the people who want know about this project
8663540 if he has to kimi will help felipe as we said at the beginning of the year
8663541 one third of the season is still left and its enough to fight back
8663542 i love that circuit and obviously i would love to race there for the whole year long
8663543 hopefully we finally get the car working the way i want
8663544 were going to make those here in indiana with american labor
8663545 im talking to two california companies trying to talk them into moving out here
8663546 we feel like in the fall of 2009 well be ready to start building buildings for them
8663547 with a projected employment of over 100 people in the next three years with a payroll of about 3 4 million it will be a really great thing for the citizens of hendricks county and the greater west side of indianapolis
8663548 anything that brings in this many dollars to an area its a lot of dollars coming into our state much of it from elsewhere
8663549 i have known and been friends with john mccain for almost 22 years but every day now i learn something new about candidate mccain
8663550 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured
8663551 oh im sorry can i get you a glass of water
8663552 hey put the police back on the phone i revoke your bail
8663553 this view combines 168 different exposures taken with spirits panoramic camera pancam 42 pointings with 4 filters at each pointing spirit took the first of the images that are combined into this view during the missions 1 477th martian day or sol february 28 2008 that was two weeks after the rover made its last move to reach the location where it would stop driving for the winter solar energy at gusev crater is so limited during the martian southern hemisphere winter that spirit does not generate enough electricity to drive nor even enough to take many images per day the last frame for this mosaic was taken on sol 1 599 july 2 2008 the rover team plans for spirit to finish taking images for the northern half of the scene during the martian spring
8663554 i agree that this is a serious issue but i take great offense at the notion that this is particularly worrisome because these women are of childbearing age wrote
8663555 not all women are pre pregnant we are more than our uteruses
8663556 framing this as a women s issue because we have the ability to become pregnant is just insulting i am tired of being thought of only as a breeding machine who should be regarded as pre pregnant at all times
8663557 you accidentally stumbled into an area that women have had very intense feelings about for at least 40 years ms
8663558 american history is very heavily affected by the first time we as an entire country realized that drugs could cause harm to the fetus and that was thalidomide in the early 1960s it changed the course of medical care
8663559 ever since women feel that if theyre ovulating theyre treated with bikini medicine ms
8663560 the attention all goes to their reproductive organs and that is not right either
8663561 we basically wanted to get together and pool our information
8663562 we live in an awfully pretty part of texas and there are important questions we need to ask
8663563 we are securing land so that when decisions are made by the puc we will have options
8663564 we have talked to landowners about land in the area but we dont know where exactly the transmission lines will be built
8663565 there are a lot of terrain issues property issues cost issues
8663566 at this point no one would know the specific routing but perhaps specific companies would know a general idea of their path
8663567 do you see a baby in my arms do you even realize that youre escorting me from the maternity wing without one are you stupid
8663568 espero nuevos descubrimientos que dar n pistas sobre la unificaci n de fuerzas y que nos permitir n quiz solucionar algunos de los numerosos misterios del modelo normal

8663577 die welt ist eine google aber da fand ich nur infos zu triumph motorr dern und schreibmaschinen hat jemand einen tip
8663578 nachtr glich erstellt oder ver ndert wurde um ein paar sch ne links zu bekommen
8663579 ill really miss the intellectual challenge there at the psc
8663580 it really is not as captivating as it might appear
8663581 theres an awful lot of bad feeling in brora about these large transport vehicles going across the bridge and down victoria road
8663582 right from the start i have felt there is an obvious solution and that is to extend the road put in place for the kilbraur wind farm it is in the hands of sse and the landowner it is common sense and i would urge golspie and brora community councils to encourage sse to recognise the unacceptability of the trunk road proposal
8663583 were not going to sit back and just take it all
8663584 we have got the co operation of some of the landowners but we have not been able to secure the co operation of all of them although there is no dispute
8663585 it would be wrong to suggest it was just down to one particular reason it is a combination of reasons that has made the kilbraur route not feasible for us
8663586 this isnt something that we have just looked at and not taken seriously we have seriously looked at the alternative options but have concluded that the strath brora route is the best option
8663587 we dont want to fly in the face of local communities views but we would like to think they would consider sse as a responsible company that has looked at all the choices and come up with the most feasible one
8663588 were disappointed that we do not seem able to communicate to local people why we have come to the conclusion that is the best road we want to continue discussions with local people and we understand their concerns
8663589 we were surprised to read in last weeks northern times that after many months of negotiations scottish and southern energy have decided to use the golspie brora route when we thought we were still in discussions with them about the kilbraur route we would welcome continued dialogue with them over access via kilbraur
8663590 the line between ashburnham and ashby is an invisible line
8663591 its important for us to know what ashburnham is doing
8663592 john mccain is a true maverick who hasnt sold out to washington d c hes his own man
8663593 we understand the concerns that members of the public and councillors alike may have regarding the visual impact of a wind turbine in this location however we do not feel that the turbine would have an unacceptable impact
8663594 although a new feature in the area we hope that the project will be viewed in the context of its contribution to the mitigation of the effects of climate change and towards the sustainable development of a local business
8663595 i can confirm that we will appeal if the decision is taken to refuse planning permission
8663596 we were disappointed in the decision made by midlothian council as we believe that auchencorth moss is the ideal location for the wind farm and a fantastic opportunity to help tackle the global threat of climate change
8663597 we are now satisfied that our proposal will comply with scottish government and local plan policy with minimal impact on the environment and the local population
8663598 the deaths of these majestic and iconic birds is awful enough but to discover that we have now lost a breeding pair of a critically endangered species is tragic
8663599 birds tasmania is extremely concerned about the future of tasmanian bird species and have previously stated that every death of an endangered species is one step closer to the extinction of that species
8663600 the greens are deeply saddened by the news of these deaths and concerned about the impact of ongoing deaths in wind turbines on a species already struggling for survival
8663601 i would expect mr llewellyn the minister responsible for threatened species to investigate these deaths and ensure the public are informed of the outcome of that investigation including what is being done to reduce eagle mortalities at woolnorth
8663602 wished that people would get real about the promise of renewables
8663603 i heard about the proposed plans when i was holding my summer surgery in shorwell and limerstone on tuesday august 19th i was approached by several local residents who were extremely concerned about what a wind farm could mean for the area on thursday 21st i raised the issue with the leader of the islands council cllr pugh and the chief executive steve beynon and they negotiated a two week extension of the scoping report this period i hope will give shorwell residents and others time to ask the questions they need
8663604 if construction goes ahead there will be a requirement for 200 candela fixed omni directional red lighting on each turbine due to their location in the night low flying system
8663605 this information is vital as it will be plotted on flying charts to make sure that military aircraft avoid this area
8663606 sos have long argued that the visual impact of this development on the area would be severe and now we learn that there will even be an impact on our night skies and dark tranquil countryside when we flew our red blimp over the site we had no idea how prescient this was
8663607 we dont blame the mod at all theyre doing what they have to do however the developers ecotricity should reconsider their position and withdraw this ill considered and inappropriate application this proposal was always going to have a severe and unacceptable impact on the local environment and now that impact would be felt 24 hours a day
8663608 im not opposed to wind energy but i always felt this could happen if heavy machinery is in and out
8663609 we pointed out our concerns to an bord plean la years ago but the planning permission was granted anyway
8663610 the company has offered full assistance to the authorities in helping those affected and the local community and tr investments have instructed carlow based geotechnical consultancy agec ltd to undertake an independent study into the cause of the landslide
8663611 agec has extensive experience of ground investigation and highway earthworks both in ireland and the uk the company provides specialist geotechnical engineering and engineering geology advice to local authorities contractors and consultants
8663612 well its a nice console with a dedicated fanbase when i was younger i would be extremely grateful when a super famicom snes title arrived very late in its life as it felt more like a tribute than a big commercial project many dreamcast users around the world are really excited about this release and the market especially in japan is big enough to make it very profitable which doesnt hurt one bit on a more techie side the dc is very robust and supports true 240p rgb which provides the definite 2d arcade experience the controller suits the game perfectly and there are practically no load times there is also vga and arcade stick support so you can truly play this game any way you want on dc
8663613 id really wanted to go out of state but at the same time i was glad
8663614 the good news is that productivity growth remains strong american industry continues to bang out new creative and attractive products and the economy is likely to have only a shallow recession
8663615 the economy should bottom out in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2009 and then recover
8663616 did not advance by amounts that we would immediately consider proportionate to the threat posed by hurricane gustav
8663617 even if gustav finds a way to dissipate its strength or veers off course there is still likely to be a substantial loss of output based on precautionary evacuations
8663618 this team will be responsible for meeting the dual objectives of conserving capital and controlling credit losses while fannie mae continues to provide crucial liquidity to the u s housing and mortgage markets
8663619 as we move through the bottom of this cycle maintaining capital managing credit and driving revenues are the priorities and we have to organize and staff accordingly
8663620 we havent lost confidence in lampert and hes moving some of the pieces around and admitting where hes made mistakes and trying to fix them
8663621 i guess were still believers a weak macro environment magnifies all your mistakes
8663622 recent government statistics show that only between 10 percent and 20 percent of the rebate dollars were spent
8663623 the rebates added nearly 80 billion to the permanent national debt but less than 20 billion to consumer spending
8663624 we have three guys who can play and im extremely confident in all of them
8663625 this is our best situation at quarterback in a number of years
8663626 well be able to get a good evaluation off a scrimmage against a good opponent
8663627 well see where we stand and where we need a lot of work well see which kids can line up and play
8663628 special teams are an area where we have real concerns
8663629 and not just because of czech we have a lot of new people there
8663630 the volunteers are so vital to the success of this program there is only one paid staff member other than myself so the volunteers keep the center running
8663631 the volunteers have donated well over 2 000 hours thats 2 000 hours we could not afford to pay for with that said i send great thanks to the volunteers and all that theyve done
8663632 some of these kids are being raised by grandparents or aunts and uncles because for some reason or other their parents arent around so weve provided a multitude of resources to assist them in their new roles everything ranging from non profits to social services for them or the children
8663633 this year has been a fun and eye opening experience for me
8663634 i started out as an intern in september of 2007 i stayed around because its still around and as a criminal justice major this is great exposure and insight
8663635 we plan to offer trainings to give more responsibility to volunteers so that we can evenly disperse the expectations with the trainings the volunteers will receive certificates of completion and have input on implementing new activities for the family activity center
8663636 this is a really heartfelt project i have a strong sense of pride regarding this project
8663637 gwen elliot went above and beyond her duties as an officer and helped to make southwest pennsylvania a much better place to live
8663638 i know my ma would be proud this center has brought so many people together even in their most trying of times
8663639 we live now in a culture of fear anxiety paranoia and insecurity were afraid of sickness afraid of death and afraid to really live
8663640 were so concerned with not bruising their self esteem that we teach them nothing about self reliance and self respect we supervise and schedulize their every moment
8663641 i dont want my children to miss out on any of that teasing and bullying it kind of makes you who you are when you dont make it on to the soccer team i remember the two weeks of crying because i didnt make the volleyball team it made me interesting
8663642 for years the dominant parenting philosophy has asserted that self esteem is the most important attribute to instil in a kid and to get it requires constant intervention rewards praising more praising rewards
8663643 somewhere on the playground between sugar and spice and evil is the kind of quotidian meanness that our kids will face forever trying to protect them from every slight every taunt is an act of hubris but its not surprising that parents try
8663644 emotional safety is the next frontier now that weve fooled ourselves into thinking weve conquered physical safety but emotional safety is harder to guarantee
8663645 were here to help and make their visit as easy as possible
8663646 soft security employees greet and meet visitors and provide information the operation is designed to be nonintrusive she said
8663647 customer service is a big part of our job hollier said
8663648 but we still need to provide security and protect the property of patients staff and visitors
8663649 the school was very welcoming and the grade 2 teacher was aware and supportive keeping an eye on the new kids
8663650 it really made a difference when the teacher hooked him up with the social butterfly of the class they are still really good friends
8663651 grade 5 can be a difficult time socially for girls
8663652 i didnt get the eight or nine girls i expected i ended up with all 24
8663653 we look at situations outside of school like a sleepover what if someone you dont get along with is there the girls act out negative and positive behaviour and talk about how it may be easier to get along with the difficult person when others are present
8663654 we practise asking forgiveness which makes an apology mean more
8663655 but we also talk about the possibility that the other person cant forgive and what to do then
8663656 there is less gossip cattiness and thoughtlessness and more accountability
8663657 one of the neat things they are talking about doing is that after the first pitch first live play or first volleyball play the first dead action will be to hand that ball over to principal mr clark mershon or athletic director mr mark mundell
8663658 then it will be put in a trophy case outside of that this will be an opening game night i dont anticipate fireworks or flyovers by stealth bombers or anything else like that i think it is going to be exciting enough for our folks and players
8663659 they are going to have a level of speed and athleticism that will keep them in the game all the time
8663660 the difference this year is they have 19 starters back this year we think they are going to be one of the top two of three teams we will face this year
8663661 you could see a sense of anxiety yet through the process of playing some you could see us realizing that we could at least compete
8663662 we dont have to be afraid that was an important step to take at the end of that we were competing
8663663 keep up to date on storm information knowing things like where the storm is predicted to hit where the storm surge is expected how far reaching the storm is all of these things will help you determine whether you are in danger or not
8663664 for example the storm will not hit your city or if it does it will likely not be as bad as you think
8663665 take the appropriate steps that you always hear about like securing loose items outside boarding windows having enough food and water on hand ensuring your pets safety and other important storm precautions
8663666 children feed off of their parents anxiety so it is important that you get it under control remind your children that you are the parent and as such you are taking every precaution necessary to ensure their safety
8663667 by exuding confidence you can help calm your childrens fears
8663668 it is important that we keep updated by watching or listening to the news but keep in mind that the media is far reaching and may be basing reports and warnings on specific viewing areas for example the circumstances for someone living in galveston may be much different for those in houston or beaumont
8663669 if there is a mandatory evacuation for the area youre in then by all means evacuate however if the choice is optional take the time to list the advantages and disadvantages and see if one list outweighs the other
8663670 make sure your reasons are based on facts rather than emotions after the evacuation disaster of hurricane rita i heard many people say they would never evacuate again however if your area of town is expected to get hit with a category five hurricane that thought may not be logical
8663671 anxiety disorder is one of the most common mental illnesses in the united states it can affect a persons job relationships and overall mental well being
8663672 mccain knows biden well he knows how good he is as a knife fighter hell take mccain apart
8663673 means mccain would run a campaign without a core constituency of the republican party
8663674 i think there would be a walkout on lieberman at the convention hes not a republican
8663675 the power of a car to take you where you wanted to go
8663676 before they were clerks and communication experts then they started to become vps and moved out of the marketing and communications box
8663677 im really sorry to say it hasnt changed that much
8663678 when you look around to see who are the top women in the industry you really have a short list
8663679 ford lost a ton of senior executives particularly women it became like an endurance contest if id wanted to run marathons id have trained for one
8663680 i feel very strongly that organizations that are going to have long term viability and global economic ties will have talent pools that reflect their consumer base which means if we were to look in the automotive industry and look at the various levels it would not be reflective of the consumer base
8663681 it was a responsibility i was ready to take on
8663682 the actions that are taken today ensure that you will be around for the future
8663683 my father created something wonderful and i wanted to be part of it
8663684 i certainly behave as if it is irrelevant and have found that if i do so it soon becomes clear to people that it doesnt really matter who they deal with as long as they are good at what they do
8663685 pushing on the bureaucracy and the leadership at fort carson and the pentagon to help the family
8663686 tammie was the most instrumental person in making sure ryan got the care he needed
8663687 she s really a fighter she refused to give in and accept the poor treatment her husband was getting
8663688 mental health problems due to a traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder from two tours in iraq
8663689 i m ready for things to stop for them to make their decision whatever it s going to be so we can move forward
8663690 unable to help himself at that moment he s a returning hero who is now incapacitated
8663691 yes but if i sleep i don t have to worry about yelling at them
8663692 no matter they do not have to get yelled at anymore
8663693 theres nothing about the tests that is designed to create anxiety or create a sense of evaluation or create a sense of being compared to someone else
8663694 once the information is available the potential exists for school administrators to use it to track students and make premature assessments
8663695 were teaching kids how to get the right answers not how to find the knowledge
8663696 statistically speaking they should have won something anything just by sheer dumb luck of the draw
8663697 ok well have you worked with anyone at this firm before
8663698 oh i think you are wonderful and well have you in a job asap
8663699 my job is not to get you a job doing what you want but to find something that is exactly what you are doing at a firm that pays better or has a better reputation
8663700 i jumped on yelp the second i got home from my post camp consultation to rave about vyayr
8663701 oh my god darin is phyllis fucking schlafly hes so sex negative i cant believe it talk about internalized homophobia lets burn him at the stake yes lets die motherfucker he must be a mole from the heritage foundation
8663702 joseph abrigo is awesome he seems to just get what it is youre looking for in a hair style and ive always been pleased with the

8663706 we were helping clear out an area in the park and even though i think i pulled up five weeds and got in the way of at least three volunteers i had a blast
8663707 this a place i have been visting for the better part of 20 years or so
8663708 two words honey cake delicious combination of light cake with rich custard i feel privileged to live near this place
8663709 hey i pay most of the bills around the house and feed my kids cupcakes do i get any respect
8663710 mexican bun its like a less sweet version of the pineapple and i love it their plain dinner buns are soo fluffy and delicious i love going to sunset bakery for buns and then having them with a latte at another cafe
8663711 britney gave me a great haircut im loving the layers

8663831 the major difference lies in the fact that nintendo makes money with the hardware alone which may be a superior business model
8663832 but the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us we decided years ago to build a game console that offers much greater functionality the playstation 3 has an enormous processor it is gradually emerging as the central server in our users homes
8663833 not for as long as i live it will certainly take some time the traditional business model for the playstation envisaged us making a loss with the hardware in the early years until the production costs had decreased to a point that enabled us to break even
8663834 in the meantime we earn money with the games we are currently at the stage in which we need to get a grip on the production costs that takes time we are already making more money with the games than we are losing with the hardware
8663835 its a different experience the wii is a well made device that has found a new target group for a while we held the same target group with the singstar karaoke game but perhaps we neglected to pursue that avenue

8663881 i was a 29 year old kid running for the united states senate in 1972 there was somewhere between six and 10 busloads of people from scranton who just spontaneously got on a bus and came down literally there were hundreds of thousands of people
8663882 barack obama couldve made that speech were he alive in 1972
8663883 by the way if i hear one more time that he was 11 years old when i went to the senate im going to smack somebody
8663884 drive for show and putt for dough is a clich because its true ive putted better and ive played better

8663891 were starting from a position in the wec where guys like faber and torres so many people know how great they are already
8663892 remember where we were when we took over the ufc we were off cable and we couldnt even get venue operators to answer our phone calls
8663893 the wec has got great talent that people know and a good tv contract with versus were still going to put a lot of our best fights on versus so this thing is only going to get better

8663905 we felt like a year ago at this time missouri was a great football team but it might be later in the year before everyone else realized how good they were
8663906 anytime you have a great quarterback like we knew he potentially was a great player but he didnt even come onto the scene until our game
8663907 i said after the game last year what a great team illinois was and they ended up in the rose bowl
8663908 the first game you want to start to see the personality of your team i like what ive seen but until youre in competition out on the field by yourself into the moment and having to deal with three and a half hours of football until you see it you dont really know how do you come out of halftime whats your attitude throughout the game what kind of toughness to you play with you want to see what kind of makeup they have
8663909 i have a few more gray hairs than when i started
8663910 when this team has had time to work together we will win games 2 0 and 3 0 not 1 0
8663911 i have only worked with the team for one month so we will get much better
8663912 i dont know our rivals sufficiently to say what our chances are but the champions league is a rather difficult competition
8663913 mourinho is an expert and the players have gained experience this could be our year
8663914 roma is very strong and has experience and you need to put them at the top of the list of contenders because they also have an excellent coach
8663915 for years i just got by but this time i really spent
8663916 the big teams are no longer in another galaxy inter milan juve and roma are still far away skyscrapers but we are now a big house
8663917 napoli has improved a lot and will continue to improve

8663934 yo s que la intenci n del gobierno y la epn es buena en fomentar el turismo y recreaci n pero no estoy de acuerdo que le est n cobrando 10 c rdobas a cada persona que ingresa a las instalaciones de ese puerto cuando se supone que eso se hizo para la gente pobre

8663936 in countries at all levels of income health and illness follow a social gradient the lower the socioeconomic position the worse the health it does not have to be this way and it is not right that it should be like this
8663937 economic growth is without question important particularly for poor countries as it gives the opportunity to provide resources to invest in improvement of the lives of their population but growth by itself without appropriate social policies to ensure reasonable fairness in the way its benefits are distributed brings little benefit to health equity
8663938 there is nothing terribly magical about these approaches but the commission provides compelling evidence that they work
8663939 canada likes to brag that for seven years in a row the united nations voted us the best country in the world in which to live do all canadians share equally in that great quality of life no they dont the truth is that our country is so wealthy that it manages to mask the reality of food banks in our cities of unacceptable housing of young inuit adults very high suicide rates

8663946 we dont usually have that number of aryan nations people here mr ross said
8663947 it was suspicious to us we turned everything over to the federal authorities
8663948 he adolf said at one point yes it would be on probably the day of his acceptance speech
8663949 it would be from a high vantage point with the named rifle
8663950 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he should be shot
8663951 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no

8663964 the active role of russia in promoting peace and co operation in the given region
8663965 one of the biggest tests heading into the convention was if the democratic party could unify itself and at least in that sense it seems to have been very successful
8663966 bill and hillary clinton were crucial to this and they seemed to have not only reconciled themselves to barack obamas candidacy but they appeared to have some genuine enthusiasm about it
8663967 i was really disappointed in both of the clintons from february until hillarys speech at the convention this week
8663968 i really feel she was being sincere and even though bill looked disappointed during her speech he redeemed himself with his own speech both of them were very clear in telling people that they must vote democrat in this election regardless of the candidate and i was so glad they said that
8663969 i was disheartened to see men standing in the top two spots at the convention yet again
8663970 it seems to me that the democratic party has some serious work to do in terms of selecting the most viable candidate and taking on that other ism sexism that being said i will vote for obama because i feel i have to as a democrat hillarys speech reaffirmed my decision to do so
8663971 ratings have increasingly declined for conventions as they became less important over the years and no real news emerged from them
8663972 you get people tuning in but those are mostly the people who are decided voters you have to wonder if the people who have the most concerns about barack obama even bothered to watch the democrats need to win the independents and the undecided voters to take the white house and those people likely werent even watching this convention
8663973 reagan had to work hard to make voters feel more comfortable with him it wasnt one moment one electrifying speech at the convention it really was a long drawn out process
8663974 my understanding is that they will use the engine the maya files where the characters come to life but theyll be creating animated i think its a 20 minute cartoon im personally quite intrigued to see how it comes out lego every time theyve had a new brand out theyve done some cgi stuff as well but i think this will be quite different

8663982 going forward samsung is transitioning well toward smartphones while lg is still struggling a bit it is hard to say what sony ericsson will do but we dont expect its xperia x1 to make a big sales splash when released later this year

8664009 ci devessere un colpevole e uno soltanto qualunque sia il numero dei delitti commessi
8664010 lintero onere deve gravare su un solo paio di spalle lintera indignazione del lettore deve potersi concentrare su una singola anima nera
8664011 il delitto devessere opera di una sola persona lessenza di un romanzo poliziesco che lunico colpevole deve imbrogliare i sette innocenti non che lunico innocente venga imbrogliato da sette colpevoli

8664107 se la mia ipotesi confermata poi c il sospetto che qualcuno negli stati uniti ha specificamente creato questo conflitto al fine di produrre un aggravamento della situazione e per generare un vantaggio competitivo nella lotta per uno dei candidati per il posto di presidente degli stati uniti
8664108 noi cosa dovremmo fare farci ammazzare per rimanere nel g8
8664109 lasciare intendere che gli stati uniti abbiano orchestrato quella cosa per conto dun candidato politico non sembra razionale
8664110 abbiamo aspettato che gli stati uniti intervenissero nel conflitto e bloccassino le azioni aggressive della leadership georgiana

8664114 e giusto ripristinarlo perch dello studente bisogna avere la possibilit di valutare tutto dal profitto al comportamento
8664115 il decreto legge contiene molte interessanti novit giusto che nella valutazione generale dei ragazzi rientri a far parte con nettezza il giudizio sul loro comportamento altrimenti potremmo assistere al paradosso di giovani capaci magari anche studiosi ma privi di regole un pericolo quindi per gli altri e per il loro stesso futuro

8664151 our financial results in recent years have mirrored the consistent improvement we have achieved in our business and we finish the year with a stronger business chief executive paul walsh said in the statement
8664152 we enter the new financial year facing slowing global growth and more challenging global economic trends
8664153 but given the strength and diversity of diageos business we believe we can deliver organic operating profit growth for the coming year within our range of 7 0 9 0 per cent mr walsh said
8664154 the main drivers of growth were international where scotch in latin america and beer in africa drove net sales growth of 16 per cent and north america where growth in the priority brands drove a 5 0 per cent increase in net sales mr walsh said
8664155 if it was going to have a major impact we would have seen it by now mr rose said

8664161 he was certainly drinking and drugs were available at the party
8664162 barnaby himself told friend samantha mallinson he had taken four ecstasy tablets that would seem to be consistent with the readings of the toxicologist
8664163 i think on two occasions samantha mallinson saw him fall over or nearly fall over at some point he has gone up the steps to the balcony possibly for fresh air
8664164 the next thing we know there was a thud and its clear he has fallen from the balcony this was an act of accidental death
8664165 he worked out exactly what he wanted to do and he did it he was an amazing person
8664166 he was a loss to the theatre as well as a great loss to our family
8664167 this cavalier approach to safety must come to an end
8664168 we no longer air to air refuel to eliminate that risk in the same way that we took out the serious design flaw
8664169 these are our people who fly this aircraft and there is no way we would risk their lives
8664170 the big indicator is are the crews happy to fly on it or not and they are
8664171 the whole foundation of what we do in the raf is relying on the aircrews sense that they want to come back alive the way aircrew work relies on their sense of self preservation if they dont think the aircraft is safe they dont fly on it
8664172 i do get the occasional question from my mum and i try to explain things to her but my parents know its the business ive joined and they know id sense it if something were being covered up
8664173 it is an enormously capable aeroplane and with what we deliver to the troops on the ground its unique all my guys work every hour of the day and are very proud of what nimrod brings to the troops in afghanistan
8664174 the amount of extra checks we do these days is huge sometimes it governs your whole day and if i didnt think it was safe i wouldnt fly on it
8664175 the period after the accident was a difficult time for everyone because we at raf kinloss had lost friends and colleagues everyone had lost someone they knew and the families of those who were lost will always be in our hearts and minds
8664176 but i wasnt worried about returning to work on the nimrod after the accident the aircraft by then had undergone dramatic transformation with the safety measures and the mod board of inquiry gave the potential causes of the accident so we could take action
8664177 it is a great aircraft its great at what it does and the crew are dedicated and focused following loss of xv230 its been very hard for our families as well
8664178 theres been so much negative reporting on nimrod but we fly the plane and we know its safe to fly our families and our friends keep seeing the negative stories so i really want to stress that if nimrod werent safe to fly we wouldnt be on board
8664179 when youre watching at home you think i can do that until you find yourself in a studio and you realise you cant do it at all
8664180 im scared of doing the foxtrot and the quickstep because its so graceful and im so not
8664181 i spoke to them about it and both of them said its going to be the best time of your life
8664182 everybody whos ever done it has said the same thing so here we are
8664183 but apart from that i havent really done any dancing
8664184 hes told me to glide and not to take any notice of anybody
8664185 i nod a lot and tap my foot at parties i had no idea how technical this would be
8664186 a dance routine in a pop band is very different from this kind of dancing
8664187 i feel the pressure so much but i think ive just got to remember that the only pressure we have is the pressure we put on ourselves so i just want to have fun
8664188 but forget it my thighs are aching so much and ive got blisters all over my feet
8664189 my feet are in bits im going to have really gnarly feet afterwards and ive got wicked bruises and bumps
8664190 its not bitchy at all backstage its actually very friendly
8664191 we all get on were all training and get tired and we keep encouraging each other
8664192 most of us have known each other professionally since we were youngsters
8664193 weve all competed against each other for years and years so we all know each other inside out it just doesnt exist

8664199 quebecs open source software association is suing the provincial government saying it is giving preferential treatment to microsoft corp by buying the companys products rather than using free alternatives the lawsuit by facil was lodged with the quebec superior court on july 15 and made public on wednesday in it the group says the provincial government has refused to entertain competing bids from all software providers opting instead to supply public sector departments with products bought from proprietary vendors such as microsoft and oracle corp
8664200 i am very pleased to have been appointed as the ceo of thrombogenics at a very exciting time for the company our recent licensing deal with roche for tb 403 has allowed us to focus and invest in the clinical development of microplasmin a product which we believe could be a major advance in the treatment of a number of important eye diseases i look forward to continue working with d sir and the rest of the senior management team to ensure we deliver significant shareholder value from our most attractive pipeline
8664201 i am glad that patrik has agreed to become thrombogenics new ceo his significant international management experience and his contribution to the companys success over the last eighteen months gives me great confidence that thrombogenics will continue to prosper under his leadership i am looking forward to serving thrombogenics where i believe i can make further important contributions to the companys success given the exciting science that is being carried out in both our labs and those of our partners
8664202 i would not be surprised if all three played at certain times
8664203 the great thing about our new quarterback is that we have a veteran offense around him with receivers who know where theyre supposed to be a veteran offensive line that can give him some protection and guidance and veteran backs that can carry the football were going to ask him to do the things that we need from the quarterback spot but not to do anything that theyre not capable of doing
8664204 what im looking for is leadership a guy that can control the football team and who guys will look up to
8664205 and if thats both of them then itll be both of them
8664206 theres more chemistry and i guess unselfishness this year than there was even two years ago when we won the national championship we might not have the talent that we had two years ago but well be much more unselfish close and together thats whats going to bring us over the hump thats where we werent last year not enough guys had played there wasnt the experience we didnt have the same camaraderie as we do now
8664207 the fans expect us to win the national championship now but i think thats a little unrealistic at this point
8664208 michigan made a lot of mistakes on offense that threw off the whole offense but at one point they were rolling then they kind of let up off of them and appalachian state never stopped their motors never stopped they were hungry so if we get up by a touchdown or five touchdowns weve got to keep pounding them
8664209 we didnt have many guys last year but those guys stayed together from spring camp through the season this year weve juggled them around more than we did all last year put together
8664210 you have to be able to adjust our game plan has a lot of adjustment in it were going to try and be as flexible as we can without confusing our kids there are a lot of unknowns youve got a quarterback starting that you have to go back and look at san diego state film or junior college film to see him you have to look at several different teams to see what you think theyre going to be doing offensively and then you have to look at ucla film to see the personnel its a little bit different but regardless of what the situation is you have to be ready to play

8664222 its like you see someone opposite of you with their head on the pillow we see our lovers and our children in that pose they look like the heads of fallen statues and they afford the viewer an intimate look at the face of the young person whose life is at risk and that was the point
8664223 when you see soldiers on the news you have no idea who they are theyre representing the united states and they have all that gear on i wanted to get past all that
8664224 we understand that soldier represents a political art project and that the individuals depicted are actual soldiers
8664225 out of context neither in a museum setting or website the images as stand alone highway or city billboards appear to be deceased soldiers the presentation in this manner could be perceived as being disrespectful to the men and women in our armed forces
8664226 how the image would be perceived by a motorist passing it in transit
8664227 its not a strong advocacy for any partisan point of view we dont see soldiers in this very individualised human way in the press or media in this country a soldier is one thing theyre in camouflage holding a rifle here theyre individuals with personalities

8664230 can you say that since a school received a 700 on their standardized test scores that they are a c school with c teachers with c administrators with c support staff
8664231 i challenge anyone to walk into one of our classrooms and schools and not be amazed buy what is happening
8664232 but at the same time the public needs to recognize that without all of us in this room together there is no economic future the state needs to recognize that if they do not treat us professionally that they will not get professionals
8664233 if our government would like to judge us they should walk onto any one of our campuses and see the miracles happening everyday a politician once said to me
8664234 i can walk into a classroom and tell within 1 minute if there is a good teacher in the room or a bad teacher
8664235 you cant judge a student you cant judge a teacher you cant judge a school by one minute or one test
8664236 this is why we see an influx of educators in politics educators do not want to be political most are forced to be when some see 2nd graders being tested and hear that a 6 year old is being labeled by how well they score on a test they see a need for change
8664237 i havent seen any proposals or bills to give a standardized test to our current senators
8664238 but we dont say this we do not say this because we trust we love our state and we love america we need our government
8664239 fullerton elementary is a great place to work from teachers to our board members to our administration and to our classified brothers and sisters we are on the right track

8664247 remembering that ill be dead soon is the most important tool ive ever encountered
8664248 the article was never meant for publication and has been retracted
8664249 its not the first time i have died in coventry
8664250 an eagerness to bend any fact to fit the purpose at hand
8664251 it is the worst thing you can do but it could happen to any of us we have a system at the times where we always have to have a date of death some other papers dont it gives us a bit of a safety net but it will never be foolproof
8664252 u s foreign policy is akin to government sponsored terrorism these days it was not a mistake that there was a huge security stand down on september 11 last year i am solo i will continue to disrupt at the highest levels
8664253 honor is serving your country and doing whats right even at personal cost just like i did when i was a pow in vietnam did you know i was a pow no well i was and i was held in a tiny prison cell for years and years and they tortured me but i wouldnt talk nope thats because im honorable and thats why i should be president did you know i was a pow well i was and obama wasnt and dont you forget it
8664254 as we look for the best choice for new baseload generation we recognize that nuclear fuel costs are much more stable over the long term

8664259 ik zit in de groep van astrid kappers die bij de faculteit natuurkunde de tastzintuiglijke waarneming onderzoekt dat kun je doen door natuurkundige stimuli te beschrijven zoals het materiaal en de vorm maar je kunt je ook afvragen h mensen die wiskundig en natuurkundig goed gedefinieerde voorwerpen waarnemen dan kom je terecht in de psychofysica mijn onderzoek ging er vooral over hoe mensen op de tast tweedimensionale vormen herkennen
8664260 wanneer je achteraf over je werk schrijft wil je als onderzoeker graag doen alsof je vooraf diep hebt nagedacht en de uitkomst al verwachtte maar eigenlijk ontstond het idee bij toeval we gebruikten vaak lijntekeningen bij demonstraties op open dagen en we merkten dat mensen heel vaak zeiden dat ze het voorwerp op de tekening pas herkenden als ze het eerst zelf op een papiertje hadden nagekrabbeld dat deed denken aan het natekeneffect en dat ben ik toen verder gaan onderzoeken
8664261 het natekeneffect is bekend uit twee gevallen in het ene gaat het om het interpreteren van de rabbitduck figuur een getekend figuurtje dat zowel een eend als een konijn voorstelt proefpersonen die er maar twee seconden naar mogen kijken zien er daarvan eentje f het konijn f de eend en als je ze daarna vertelt dat er nog een andere interpretatie van de figuur mogelijk is slagen ze er niet in zich die voor de geest te halen zon herinterpretatie lukt hen pas als ze het figuurtje op een stuk papier hebben nagetekend
8664262 in het andere geval gaat het om het visualiseren van gesproken instructies zoals neem een hoofdletter d in gedachten en kantel die 90 graden tegen de klok in plak nu ook in gedachten aan de onder kant een hoofdletter j vast wat zie je dan
8664263 ja dit lukt de meeste mensen wel maar wanneer je de instructies iets moeilijker maakt blijkt weer dat mensen schetsen nodig hebben
8664264 ja en dat laat weer zien dat wij er niet goed in zijn om uit losse na elkaar verzamelde gegevens een beeld op te bouwen dat wij er dus slecht in slagen om beelden als het ware te projecteren op een intern beeldscherm in ons hoofd
8664265 were not going to let our food costs rise faster than our food budgets so if we can buy in bulk we can save in a per eating effect
8664266 overall these trends last a long period of time because consumers adjust their buying habits and they change their routine
8664267 i wanted to be able to buy in bulk when things were on sale or at a pretty good price and have the room to save and freeze and store anything that we can get a good price
8664268 freezers tend to be countercyclical meaning that they generally do better when the economy is soft because people go out less and buy groceries in bulk
8664269 while we think giant has the ability to right the ship given our expectations for a challenging 2h08 and lackluster pipeline we no longer feel comfortable recommending shares of giant
8664270 the other thing i would say about our brands is that they have faced world wars they have faced revolutions they have faced more economic cycles than we will see and they are today faster more profitable and appealing to more customers than ever before
8664271 inevitably the companys outlook for 2009 is rather less bullish and the ongoing rise in commodity costs could yet erode some of its operating margins
8664272 nonetheless the company is well positioned to withstand slowing economic growth
8664273 people are not necessarily drinking more but are wanting to drink better
8664274 theres still this nucleus of consumers that can access the best and want to do so

8664294 shortly after moving to powys our friends in london would say whats it like where you live
8664295 we would say its horrible stay away because we didnt want anyone to know how peaceful and relaxing it was in comparison to the rat race in london
8664296 that was 30 years ago but the pace of life hasnt altered a great deal since then
8664297 sometimes the lifestyle makes us laugh especially when people born and bred in the county take things for granted
8664298 for instance i remember being with a farmer one day and i was seeing these wonderful views for the first time i was amazed but all the farmer was concerned about was whether his tractor radio could receive radio 1
8664299 people from outside the area see powys as a rural idyll but if theyre not prepared to sacrifice a few things then they can learn to dislike their new home
8664300 we know a couple who moved to powys because they wanted to escape the rat race but the woman in the relationship couldnt drive and she eventually hated the area
8664301 but in some ways the drawbacks add to the areas charm and thats why some people move here
8664302 for example i recently saw two old women clapping and mouthing well done as a police car drove through llanfair it was hilarious but charming at the same time can you imagine that happening in cardiff or birmingham
8664303 i would never go back to living in the south east of england its over crowded and a stressful place
8664304 for instance if i forget to lock my car at night it doesnt bother me because i know it will be there in the morning
8664305 powys has some of the lowest crimes rates in the uk and that gives us peace of mind
8664306 everybody knows each other and its such a friendly place a five minute trip to the shops can turn into 20 minutes when you stop and chat
8664307 the iphone changes the game for consumers when shopping for the best prices on goods and services the immediacy of being able to use the iphone to perform targeted internet queries anywhere allows people to optimize their purchasing dollar
8664308 award tour is the feeling of utter happiness and elation that you feel when you truly enjoy what you are doing
8664309 apples iphone isnt huge in sales volume but it helped energize the market
8664310 people are now walking into stores and asking for a smartphone something that didnt really happen in the past
8664311 nokia has a strong foothold in the smartphone category already and that will continue to be the case but others such as research in motion are working their way up
8664312 going forward samsung is transitioning well toward smartphones while lg is still struggling a bit it is hard to say what sony ericsson will do but we dont expect its xperia x1 to make a big sales splash when released later this year
8664313 i think i would remember jennies fist connecting with a part of my body or a part of my face
8664314 unfortunately daughters of charity has ignored our call to help improve patient care for several months
8664315 we are on the picket line today to put our patients first frontline caregivers must continue to have a voice in staffing levels and medical treatment
8664316 because of the dedication of its healthcare workers the daughters of charity health system has enjoyed years of prosperity hospital administrators continue to rebuff requests to discuss proposals affecting the recruitment and retention of qualified healthcare professionals and they want to limit frontline caregivers ability to act as an advocate for their patients
8664317 i urge management to do what is best for workers and our community its time to bargain in good faith
8664318 no reports of abuse of the volunteer exemption by the department of industrial relations
8664319 many youtubers do create strong and tight relations on youtube that extend beyond the screen into physical contexts and there are a growing number of youtube gatherings worldwide in which tubers meet one another face to face see lange 2007 but the experience of profound and deep connection with relatively or even totally anonymous strangers viewed on the screen from a distance remains an important phenomenon with important implications for how we understand ourselves and our relations with others
8664320 i just feel blessed to be a part of it
8664321 every major historic event in history needs a devoted and excited audience and i get to be one of those people
8664322 i dont know the economics of it but id like to steal one of these i want a whole set
8664323 youll still see a lot of politics and a lot of news
8664324 i dont think the show is going to be drastically different its not going to suddenly become a crime show thats not who i am its not going to be vastly different from what youre seeing now
8664325 it can be a lonely place to be the person in the middle because you can get complaints from the right and complaints from the left
8664326 you dont often hear from the people who are happy

8664328 during initial sessions tuesday some committee members had to tiptoe carefully as they reviewed the sections of the 48 page document on abortion and immigration two hot button issues where mccain has at times been at odds with the gops base
8664329 by increasing our american energy supply and decreasing the long term demand for oil we will be well positioned to address the challenge of global warming
8664330 we saw a slight improvement in july but dont expect to see a major recovery for the remainder of the year
8664331 this month general motors sales would have been down at least 30 percent if it hadnt launched their employee discount for everyone promotion
8664332 but overall the program has not been nearly as effective as its first implementation back in 2005
8664333 the pitch and intensity of the military rhetoric of this branch of the global dominionist movement has substantially increased since the beginning of 2008
8664334 one can only wonder how long before this transforms into real warfare with actual warriors
8664335 it sets a very chilling precedent that someone who is brought back gets the book thrown at them
8664336 our first priority must be the safety of the public
8664337 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8664338 this suggestion should be seriously considered not just for dietary supplements but also for conventional foods
8664339 the area of trace elements in dietary supplements is one the association has dedicated time and attention to and through the work of our committees we will continue to assist ahpa companies in reaching their quality standards
8664340 products made by members of the american herbal product association capsules liquids pastes are less likely to contain toxic metals
8664341 products that have obtained seals of quality approval from consumer lab com and the united states pharmacopeia usp can be assumed to be free of significant levels of toxic metals
8664342 i am dislodging food trapped in this mans trachea i am in no way aroused
8664343 why the church should be so closely associated with a music festival
8664344 i find only system egoism intolerance and a comlete lack of artisitc taste

8664347 she was held against a wall and he held her neck tight and she struggled for breath
8664348 our issue is with backyard breeders and puppy mills that recklessly employ irresponsible and often terribly cruel and inhumane practices to breed innocent animals and then market them in pet stores or on the internet they are motivated by greed and profit not the love and value of the breed and each individual animal we are educating the public that any kind of wonderful healthy and loving dog can be found in a local shelter

8664350 this report says that when you drink from a well in new jersey do so at your own risk
8664351 what is at the bottom of these wells proves that the state testing program is broken and in need of a total overhaul
8664352 the act and subsequent regulations do not require water treatment if any test parameter standard level is exceeded
8664353 since no state agency has the ability to verify that all real estate transactions sales and leases subject to testing under the pwta have been reported to njdep the absence of results along with errors or mistakes in the reported data could have a significant impact on the evaluation and interpretation of the data presented
8664354 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8664355 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8664356 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
8664357 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
8664358 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens
8664359 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter

8664362 the fire danger in the forest is higher than it was when the 16 000 acre power and 8 000 acre freds fires started in 2004 its higher than 2001 when the 16 000 acre star fire started and its higher than 1992 when the 24 500 acre cleveland fire started
8664363 to the tens of thousands of visitors we expect to come to the forest this labor day weekend smokey bears message is dead on
8664364 i have been disappointed to find such a large number of people continuing to build campfires even though they have been prohibited since last june
8664365 many people are abiding by the rules but every weekend we find way too many people putting the forest at risk with illegal campfires and barbeques they are even abandoning their very hot illegal campfires it only takes one
8664366 the forest is dry enough that a hot piece of carbon from an exhaust muffler can start a fire
8664367 folks need to remember that it is still their responsibility to know the rules and regulations prior to camping and that they could be held responsible for any and all suppression costs created by their negligence
8664368 i would remind you that off the coast of louisiana and texas they both had hurricanes that did not cause any real difficulties so the environmental side of it i think is pretty well okay
8664369 im aware that off the coast of louisiana and texas there are oil rigs as we well know and those rigs have survived very successfully the impacts of hurricanes hurricane katrina as far as louisiana is concerned
8664370 i wanted to make the film and the facts about the occupation of iraq accessible to a larger group of people my hope is that this will contribute to the process of making better foreign policy decisions moving forward in iraq and elsewhere during this election year its important to examine the leadership mentality and policies that caused iraq to descend into such a horrific state that after 4 000 american deaths at least a quarter million iraqis killed 4 million refugees and over 2 trillion spent iraq remains in a state of near collapse
8664371 in recognition of the film as timely work that clearly illuminates the misguided policy decisions that have led to the catastrophic quagmire of the us invasion and occupation of iraq
8664372 we are saddened to lose such a wonderful friend to our community and our love goes out to phyllis and her family during this most difficult time
8664373 we would not be at this incredible moment in history where all couples have equal rights under california law if it had not been for dels lifetime of courage and leadership our community will forever honor her life and legacy

8664378 the electron beam lithography machine will give researchers at the university of washington the ability to work on nanoscale projects with a broad range of possible commercial applications
8664379 this tool will place the university among a handful of institutions with such a capability ultimately it could lead to the creation of many new companies and products
8664380 our region has the capacity for being a serious player in nanoscience this is a key piece that will allow pacific northwest researchers to compete in this field in the international arena
8664381 this is the most flexible capable machine that you would buy to build nanostructures
8664382 this is a prototyping machine the kind of system used to prototype technologies that are still five 10 or 20 years out

8664388 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads
8664389 from the day we went to school we learned nothing on the contrary we were made obtuse we were wrapped in a fog of words and abstractions
8664390 ive always said that theres nothing an atheist cant do if hes really unsure whether he believes anything or not
8664391 we cannot know given the state of our current knowledge whether an elixir of extremely long life is possible
8664392 we want our customers to be satisfied with every aspect of their shopping experience at zamberg com including knowing that their personal information is safe when they shop with us thats why we choose to go with comodo a brand that many consumers trust to secure their pcs this brand recognition gave us immediate credibility with many more site visitors than ever before
8664393 zamberg com has been able to convert increased trust into increased sales because it overtly demonstrates how much it values the security of its customers i look forward to the day when we can trust everyone on the internet as much as zambergs customers can trust them

8664401 there was a technical delegation which has done its part in the negotiations and achieved results
8664402 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8664403 health inequity really is a matter of life and death
8664404 but health systems will not naturally gravitate towards equity unprecedented leadership is needed that compels all actors including those beyond the health sector to examine their impact on health primary health care which integrates health in all of governments policies is the best framework for doing so
8664405 central to the commissions recommendations is creating the conditions for people to be empowered to have freedom to lead flourishing lives nowhere is lack of empowerment more obvious than in the plight of women in many parts of the world health suffers as a result following our recommendations would dramatically improve the health and life chances of billions of people
8664406 water borne diseases are not caused by a lack of antibiotics but by dirty water and by the political social and economic forces that fail to make clean water available to all heart disease is caused not by a lack of coronary care units but by lives people lead which are shaped by the environments in which they live obesity is not caused by moral failure on the part of individuals but by the excess availability of high fat and high sugar foods
8664407 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy
8664408 a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance
8664409 it is wonderful to have global endorsement of the australian closing the gap campaign from the csdh established by the who the csdh sets closing the gap as a goal for the whole world and produces the evidence on how health inequities are a reflection of the way we organize society and distribute power and resources the good news from the csdh for australia is that it provides plenty of ideas on how to set an agenda that will tackle the underlying determinants of health and create a healthier australia for all of us
8664410 canada likes to brag that for seven years in a row the united nations voted us
8664411 a fairer world will be a healthier world a health service and medical interventions are just one of the factors that influence population health the growth of inequalities and the phenomena of increased injustice in health is present in low and middle income countries as well as across europe it would be a crime not to take every action possible to reduce them
8664412 the report suggests avenues for action from the local to national and global levels it has been eagerly awaited by policy makers health officials grassroot activists and their community based organizations much of the research and evidence is of particular relevance to the south east asian region where too many people struggle daily for justice and equity in health the report will inspire the region to act and develop new policies and programmes
8664413 a man should not be concerned with whether he has enough possessions but whether possessions have been equally distributed
8664414 the who commission addresses one of the major issues of our global world health inequity the reports recommendations will be perceived utilized and implemented as a major policy agenda at national and global levels the issue will increase in importance as the general public become more engaged via civil society movements and multi stakeholder involvement
8664415 according to the islamic ideology social justice became a priority when the islamic revolution materialized in iran establishing a solid primary health care network in our country not only improved our health statistics but it was an excellent vehicle to move towards health equity now through the final report of the csdh and implementing its recommendations we need to move much faster in our own country towards health equity
8664416 the commission on social determinants of health report will help african leaders adapt their national development strategies to address the challenges to health these are derived from the current systemic changes taking place in the global economy that affects heavily on the poorest segments of africas population
8664417 the primary object of development for any country and for the world as a whole is the elimination of unfreedoms that reduce and impoverish the lives of people central to human deprivation is the failure of the capability to live long and healthy lives this is much more than a medical problem it relates to handicaps that have deep social roots under michael marmots leadership this who commission has concentrated on the badly neglected causal linkages that have to be adequately understood and remedied a fuller understanding is also a call for action
8664418 the united states of america spends more on health care than any other country in the world yet it ranks 41st in terms of life expectancy new orleans and its experience with hurricane katrina illustrate why we need to target social determinants of health sdh including housing education working and learning conditions and whether people are exposed to toxins better than any place i can think of right now by targeting the sdh we can rapidly move towards closing the gap that unfairly and avoidably separates the health status of groups of different socio economic status social exclusion experience and educational background
8664419 health delivery is not possible for people living in squalor in dehumanizing pathetic conditions prevailing in the ever growing slum settlements of cities and towns in developing countries investment in basic services such as water and education will always remain constrained if not wasted unless accompanied by requisite investment in decent housing with basic sanitation
8664420 countries of the world are presently growing apart in health terms this is very worrying in many countries in the world social differences in health are also growing and this is true in europe we have been one sidedly focused on economic growth disregarding negative consequences for health and climate we need to think differently about development
8664421 what this report makes clear is that improving health and health outcomes and reducing avoidable health differences goals of all countries involves far more than just improving the health care system basic living conditions employment early childhood education treatment of women and poverty all impact on health outcomes and incorporating their effects on health outcomes needs to become an important part of public policymaking this is as true for wealthy countries like the united states as it is for many of the emerging countries of the world where large numbers of people live on less than 2 per day
8664422 and surely struggle against him we must in every possible way who would annihilate knowledge and reason and mind and yet ventures to speak confidently about everything
8664423 when the power of love becomes stronger than the love of power we will have peace

8664426 ive always said that theres nothing an atheist cant do if hes really unsure whether he believes anything or not
8664427 but what really incensed me was when i was told i could not change it back to lloyds is pants because they said it was not appropriate
8664428 i asked if it was pants they didnt like and would lloyds is rubbish do but they didnt think so
8664429 so i tried barclays is better and that didnt go down too well either
8664430 the rules seemed to change and they told me it had to be one word so i tried censorship but they didnt like that and then said it had to be no more than six letters long
8664431 it is very disappointing that he felt the need to express his upset with our service in this way customers can have any password they choose and it is not our policy to allow staff to change the password without the customers permission

8664446 today shell plans to evacuate approximately 300 personnel from its gom operations yesterday shell safely evacuated almost 400 people we expect to evacuate the remaining 600 personnel on friday and saturday given the evacuation of personnel and forecast track we have begun shut in procedures for a few shell operated assets that require long lead times such as subsea wells
8664447 the kind of damage we saw in those storms were a first for many in the industry
8664448 the go go days of the 90s also gave us the dotcom boom and when that went bust allan greenspan and the federal reserve lowered the interest rates to ease the pain dropping them so low many now see the roots of the current housing mess way back in the dotcom boom plus t

8664451 they took us from record surpluses to an exploding debt from over 22 million new jobs to just five million from increasing working families incomes to nearly 7 500 a year to a decline of more than 2 000 a year for almost eight million americans lifted out of poverty to more than 5 5 million driven into poverty and millions more losing their health insurance
8664452 there are no easy answers but there are simple answers we must have the courage to do what we know is morally right
8664453 sure well you know bill clinton is and rightfully credited with being the president who resided over the longest economic expansion in american history
8664454 the main feature of the new economy is a stock market bubble of unprecedented magnitude when the bubble bursts the new economy will just be a bad memory what are you going to tell people who lose much of their retirement savings in their 401k when theres a downturn
8664455 the nations political leaders chose to ignore the stock market bubble
8664456 as a result millions of families have seen their dreams of a secure retirement or their childrens college education vanish as a result millions of families have seen their dreams of a secure retirement or their childrens college education vanish with the stock market bubble the level of negligence of the nations political leaders in ignoring the stock bubble exceeds anything since the days of herbert hoover

8664463 this latest escalation of the conflict undermines our efforts to resume our work in the gorilla sector it is almost 1 year to the day since this conflict started but we are as determined as ever to get back in it is critical that we know the status of the mountain gorillas
8664464 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8664465 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8664466 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8664467 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8664468 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8664469 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people

8664474 our ice breaking research vessel polarstern is currently on a scientific mission in the arctic ocean departing from iceland the route has taken the ship through the northwest passage into the canadian basin where geophysical and geological studies will be carried out along profiles into the makarov basin to study the tectonic history and submarine geology of the central arctic ocean in addition oceanographic as well as biological studies will be carried out polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
8664475 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
8664476 at awi we place particular emphasis on studying arctic sea ice and along with in situ studies of sea ice thickness change satellite data have been used extensively not only for the regular observation of changes in the arctic and antarctic but also for optimising the operation of polarstern in regions covered by sea ice
8664477 arsenic poisoning is behind many instances of ill health in southern asia including a rising number of cancer cases developing a low cost method of decontaminating ground water that is laced with high levels of arsenic is a key challenge for sustainable agriculture there
8664478 while there are some techniques available for treating relatively small quantities of water there has until now been no viable technology available for decontaminating groundwater on a large scale that can ensure safe irrigation and potable water supply
8664479 this project developed by queens is the only method which is eco friendly easy to use and deliverable to the rural community user at an affordable cost
8664480 from its inception we have had the vital support of indian based stakeholders such as village councils and local financial institutions this has been vital as they are the authorities who monitor the water supply and distribution in rural areas and provide micro credit to the local farmers
8664481 with their help we now have a solution which is transferable to many areas in need across asia
8664482 quagga and zebra mussels pose a serious threat to our waters and fisheries
8664483 the spread of these mussels threatens water delivery systems hydroelectric facilities agriculture recreational boating and fishing and the environment in general boaters should be prepared for inspections throughout the state that will help ensure californias water bodies remain mussel free
8664484 anyone planning to go boating should contact their destination about local restrictions or requirements
8664485 at some locations potentially contaminated vessels those not properly cleaned drained and dried could be turned away
8664486 we are strongly encouraging boaters to arrive at state park reservoirs with clean and dry vessels to ensure they are granted access
8664487 boaters should be prepared to have their boats inspected and we hope that people understand and cooperate to stop the spread of this destructive invasive species
8664488 vehicles with watercraft are being stopped at many of the california border stations for inspection
8664489 from january 2007 to july 2008 we have inspected more than 140 000 vessels crossing into california while more than 13 000 needed cleaning we have confirmed adult mussels on nearly 170 each of those finds meant we saved a california lake or reservoir from exposure to the mussels

8664497 the dmca was intended to facilitate the growth of electronic commerce not squelch it
8664498 the court finds no reasonable juror could conclude that a comprehensive review of every file would be feasible
8664499 the decision rendered here is confined to the particular combination of facts in this case and is not intended to push the bounds of the safe harbor so wide that less than scrupulous service providers may claim its protection
8664500 we are very happy that the judge in this case recognized our compliance with the dmca and our efforts to respect copyrights
8664501 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights

8664505 veoh has a strong dmca policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringement on its web site and works diligently to keep unauthorized works off its site
8664506 youtube has gone above and beyond the law to protect content owners while empowering people to communicate and share their experiences online
8664507 we work every day to give content owners choices about whether to take down leave up or even earn revenue from their videos and we are developing state of the art tools to let them do that even better

8664509 the decision rendered here is confined to the particular combination of facts in this case and is not intended to push the bounds of the safe harbor so wide that less scrupulous service providers may claim its protection
8664510 the plaintiffs in the veoh case never bothered to send a notice of infringing activity to veoh before they filed suit of course once veoh was sued and realized what it was getting in trouble for it took down all the infringing videos so the court was sympathetic that veoh had been taken by surprise
8664511 by contrast viacom doesnt deny that youtube takes down infringing content when it is notified
8664512 if viacom flags a particular user that has uploaded a
8664513 the record presented demonstrates that far from encouraging copyright infringement veoh has a strong dmca policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringement on its web site and works diligently to keep unauthorized works off its web site
8664514 we are very pleased that judge lloyd has recognized veohs strict compliance with the dmca and our dedication to providing a valuable service for users that respects the rights of content owners
8664515 the court does not find that the dmca was intended to have veoh shoulder the entire burden of policing third party copyrights on its web site
8664516 there is an interesting and worrying phenomenon that the commission and national regulators have identified
8664517 in some cases operators are charging you for a call of one minute two seconds what they can charge you for two minutes this is a result of not charging by the second
8664518 a lot of operators resorted to billing whole minutes and not the exact amount of time the consumer uses
8664519 most operators did not change their billing system since the introduction of the roaming regulations
8664520 a difference that operators can use to attract consumers with different preferences
8664521 the biggest significance of this deal is that cnpc will benefit as the first international oil company to be developing one of the giant discovered oil fields in iraq in the new era
8664522 they will be the first with people on the ground and the first to develop a working relationship with iraqs oil ministry
8664523 given traditional markets have been dominated by well established international oil companies new entrants such as cnpc have to focus on new markets
8664524 the majors are going to have to seriously rethink their returns criteria and resource ownership flexibility
8664525 looking forward to future bidding rounds iraq could cease to be that opportunity that people had hoped for and become a different play altogether
8664526 its difficult to see this having a wider implication for the majors and other contracts
8664527 this is a self contained project and is different in many ways to the large scale projects to boost oil capacity elsewhere in iraq
8664528 if anything this is a sign that iraq is serious about these long term contracts and that shahristani can get them signed
8664529 this will focus big oil companies even more on the upcoming bid round
8664530 colour presentations are unnecessary for internal purposes therefore going forward colour copying and printing should only be used for client presentations

8664610 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights youtube has gone above and beyond the law to protect content owners while empowering people to communicate and share their experiences online
8664611 even if the veoh decision were to be considered by other courts that case does nothing to change the fact that youtube is a business built on infringement that has failed to take reasonable measures to respect the rights of creators and content owners google and youtube have engaged in massive copyright infringement conduct that is not protected by any law including the dmca

8664619 consumers are purchasing our playstation 3 video game consoles faster than we can produce them
8664620 we currently have a production bottleneck with the playstation 3
8664621 not for as long as i live laughs it will certainly take some time
8664622 the wii is a well made device that has found a new target group for a while we held the same target group with the singstar karaoke game but perhaps we neglected to pursue that avenue
8664623 the major difference lies in the fact that nintendo makes money with the hardware alone which may be a superior business model but the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us we decided years ago to build a game console that offers much greater functionality the playstation 3 has an enormous processor it is gradually emerging as the central server in our users homes
8664624 are currently at the stage in which we need to get a grip on the production costs
8664625 in terms of specific things it hasnt made much difference the original game fit on a 360 disk so it wasnt like we were in need of room weve tried to do what we can to make sure that the ps3 looks just as great as the 360 but in terms of necessarily utilising something specific about blu ray to my knowledge blu ray hasnt necessarily made a huge difference
8664626 graphical quality our goal was always to make sure everything looked just as good as on xbox 360 so there was never anybody who could say hey why didnt i get this on 360 originally because i dont feel like its up to the visual quality were just trying to make sure that everybody is happy
8664627 right now we are supporting the ps3 launch we are really excited to be bringing the bioshock experience to a whole new set of fans weve been concentrating on ways to make this game special the things that weve added theyre not changing the original experience that the 360 fans and the pc fans got but are things that compliment nicely that experience
8664628 the answer is no right now this is a ps3 exclusive

8664680 about tribalism because my feeling is that what happens on the internet is not discourse anyone can get up there and write a blog and people who happen to agree with your perspective are going to plug into it
8664681 im right and heres another guy who thinks the same as i do the internet reinforces things it creates tribes rather than bringing people together for some kind of discourse or understanding of opposite views
8664682 of course my job is all about listening and my aim really is teach the world to listen thats my only real aim in life

8664694 thoratec corporation thor is starting a strong new long term up trend the stock is now making higher highs and higher lows above a rising 200 day moving average relative strength differential rsd our proprietary indicator for selecting super strong stocks is well above the 25 threshold line again indicating the up trend in thor is outperforming the s amp p 500 by a wide margin and can therefore be considered as a candidate for a buy
8664695 in the long run i dont think that is going to be necessarily true i think consumers are going to start to switch away if prices become a larger factor
8664696 trading away to more affordable goods would be a reasonable option
8664697 there are a lot of consumers who are very insensitive and only want to buy organic or buy products that are deemed natural
8664698 that wont go away and that has always grown but there might be a substantial slow down away from that
8664699 sourcing organic food may become increasingly harder as well because the margins on organic isnt the same as other food the incentive for farmers is diminishing
8664700 organic categories that consumers find relevant and those that they find uninteresting and even frivolous
8664701 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8664702 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8664703 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signalling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8664704 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8664705 because both berries and peitc maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of oesophageal cancer
8664706 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
8664707 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumour inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone
8664708 carcinogen altered genes in rat esophagus positively modulated to normal levels of expression by both black raspberries and phenylethyl isothiocyanate
8664709 superpremium juice marketers highlight the purportedly beneficial properties of their brands ingredients

8664725 the future is now when it comes to reducing fuel and being a good corporate citizen
8664726 were entering the age of hybrid technology with paclease and vehicles its our first step we expect to save up to 35 in our fuel bill with these trucks and down the road that can make quite an impact as we typically buy more than 310 000 gals per year for our delivery trucks
8664727 we have a high comfort level with paclease and peterbilt in leasing these new hybrids
8664728 we look at the hybrids as a way to be good corporate stewards in the reduction of fuel consumption and emissions while doing our part for the environment
8664729 its not just management whos excited to get these trucks
8664730 drivers are as well they know the quality comfort and ride of peterbilt trucks theyre excited
8664731 im quite certain all the major truck stops will be offering fueling at the filling tanks alongside diesel
8664732 theres also going to be a locator available from the dept of energy that will show you where you can get it
8664733 when we launched our daimler scr initiatives we thought there were four things we had to get across to our customers

8664738 leaseplan usa has experienced significant growth and success over the past several years but i feel it is time for someone else to take this great company to the next level
8664739 i have tremendous confidence that mike pitcher is the person to do just that
8664740 i am extremely pleased to be a part of the cargowise edi team
8664741 the company with its modular based enterprise system for freight forwarders has long been recognized as an industry leader in its field and i plan to put my experience to work immediately by promoting its service offerings at numerous upcoming events
8664742 we are delighted to have bill join the cargowise edi team
8664743 his reputation in the freight forwarding industry precedes him and his strong 17 year background in sales and management within the industry including his knowledge of u s chb makes him a valuable addition to the cargowise edi sales effort as we continue to expand the market base for our edienterprise software system
8664744 outfitting a fleet with the appropriate selection of cellular components and services to run a complete mobile communications solution can be a daunting task
8664745 furthermore local cellular representatives tend to be unfamiliar with our users product specific cellular requirements we have established this relationship with nationlink wireless to provide our users with a one stop shopping and service center for all of their cellular needs saving them a great deal of time and money

8664749 we couldnt be more excited with the creative direction josh schwartz and his team are executing on chuck this show has really hit its stride and deserves a full season commitment to carry out the producers vision for this unique series
8664750 whats the next step using the dashes on the road to point you towards a wal mart or use the traffic screens on highways to promote a new car model
8664751 the blame lies squarely on the managers of municipalities who forget that their primary job is to provide quality service to residents not to sell our sight lines and turn our infrastructure into advertising opportunities a city doesnt always have to say yes
8664752 michelle and i were deeply saddened to hear that del martin had passed del committed her life to fighting discrimination and promoting equality our thoughts and prayers go out to her spouse phyllis lyon and all those who were touched by her life
8664753 the loss of del martin is a great loss for me personally and for our entire community
8664754 del was an extraordinary woman her grace courage and commitment were a source of strength to all who knew her
8664755 the total investment of the project is expected to be about 3bn
8664756 were not getting paid by the campaign but we want to help get him elected
8664757 people have their own point of view that isnt necessarily the official view
8664758 with user generated content the agenda being set is coming from the population not the campaign
8664759 there are different groups participating in the political process this time younger people and constituents who are otherwise not from the traditional political establishment
8664760 its something more permanent than a spoken comment and less likely to be misattributed
8664761 the messages that are selling are overwhelmingly positive and thats with mccain too
8664762 we have just as much negative content available but thats not selling
8664763 you have a candidate on the democratic side who not only appeals to folks as a celebrity and is often presented as such on access hollywood and the cover of rolling stone but the fact is that his image sells
8664764 popular culture has always had a bad rap as an industry perceived as forcing things down peoples throats and manufacturing enthusiasm
8664765 but if you believe that obama products could be seen as a form of political brainwashing that model is wrong you cant force people to buy things and wear them just as you cant make people see films that they dont want to see
8664766 when we started we both had full time jobs but we wanted a way to get obamas name out there
8664767 once we started doing it and seeing the reaction from our family and friends we decided we should give back to the campaign
8664768 sometimes orsons problem is muddied execution at other times its a flawed idea detractors will be quick to brand it as pretentious while critics may pull punches for fear of seeming like they just dont understand
8664769 la victoria nos da un poco m s de tranquilidad despu s de dos derrotas pero sabemos que estamos ah en la pelea en la lucha y no podemos bajar tenemos que seguir con esta senda de triunfos y esperemos que pueda ser as
8664770 el logro no es por m todos hablamos de que ten amos dos partidos perdidos y que deber amos que ganar a como diera lugar hoy gracias a dios el equipo se uni luchamos todos juntos y se dio un triunfo importante
8664771 is mark warner there oh hes busy can i just leave a quick message yeah your speech suuuucked it suuuucked it made no sense and you suuuucked

8664774 for 15 months the 13th man buddi prasad gurung was held in iraq against his will before kbr and daoud allowed him to return home to nepal
8664775 it doesnt appear that any of them knew they were going to iraq
8664776 in no way condones or tolerates unethical or illegal behaviour
8664777 no es f cil cuando se tiene una pretemporada como la que nosotros hemos tenido en la que a veces te faltan diez hombres por razones diferentes bien por compromisos internacionales o por los juegos ol mpicos
8664778 entonces regresan dos o tres jugadores una semana la siguiente vienen m s
8664779 seguiremos mejorando y estaremos totalmente preparados como equipo cuando comiencen las fases de grupo ya que hasta ahora nos hemos ido preparando para cada partido sin contar con cuatro o cinco jugadores en cada encuentro
8664780 hi boys im springing a really hot date on you pack an overnight bag and meet me at my house at 10a
8664781 porque tuvimos muchas oportunidades de gol que no pudimos concretar en la nica llegada que tuvieron nos convierten creo que merecimos m s pero bueno as es el futbol
8664782 ustedes mismos lo comentan es un gran portero y bueno influy en el marcador obviamente

8664785 radomir antic es amigo de nuestra familia y sabemos bien cu l es su opini n acerca de las cualidades futbol sticas de mi hijo no hemos hablado de su deseo de que bojan juegue con serbia pero seguro lo haremos en cuanto nos veamos
8664786 antic es un gran entrenador y la persona ideal para llevar a serbia a un mundial no hay duda de que espa a cuenta con bojan quien pas por todas sus selecciones inferiores
8664787 sin embargo estuvo orgulloso incluso de poder estar en el banquillo
8664788 creo que no habr m s incorporaciones durante la semana pasada tuvimos negociaciones con un club hicimos una oferta por un jugador neves la oferta no ha sido aceptada o atendida y la mantenemos porque la hemos hecho no s si se alcanzar un acuerdo o no en esta situaci n pero fuera de esta situaci n concreta trabajada y posible no vamos a iniciar nada m s
8664789 no s si est concretado eso el fichaje de neves por el hamburgo y habl hace un rato con el agente la situaci n de los jugadores que no son de clubes sino que son de inversores son especiales y muchas veces no sabes donde est s y esa es la situaci n de thiago
8664790 considero que con maniche y ver banega tenemos dos futbolistas que se acercan un poco a lo que quiere aguirre tambi n consideramos que la solicitud del entrenador que es l gica y que hemos intentado cubrir tampoco se puede cubrir a cualquier precio
8664791 si cualquier precio a adi supone pagar m s de lo que vale un futbolista o deshacer un equilibrio de los salarios del vestuario el club no va a sacrificar la estabilidad el equilibrio la convivencia y la buena relaci n club jugador o jugadores entre s
8664792 el club en ese aspecto est feliz de tener lo que tiene y me gustar a que en lugar de que la pregunta fuera si viene thiago neves o no me preguntarais si sigue simao o no si sigue kun o no o si sigue maxi o no
8664793 y la vamos teniendo vamos poco a poco y creo que el club est bien y tienes jugadores suficientes para cumplir los objetivos
8664794 el hecho de que ayer cuando termin el partido e iba andando hacia el coche hubiera mucha gente que me felicitaba lo primero o lo segundo
8664795 ayer hemos ganado al schalke por 4 0 el schalke es los ltimos a os el segundo club de alemania sin discusi n y el a o anterior fue el octavo club de europa estamos compitiendo en un nivel m s alto cada vez y la plantilla y el cuerpo t cnico nos est n dando lo que les estamos pidiendo que es el cumplimiento de los objetivos
8664796 no hay ninguna oferta formal hasta ahora del benfica por seitaridis es verdad que tanto maniche como l han estado en situaci n de transferibles pero quedan tres d as y ya todo viene un poco contracorriente
8664797 la salida de cualquier jugador ahora aunque fuera una operaci n econ micamente buena para el club supondr a probablemente un deterioro en el nivel deportivo del equipo l gicamente hay m s departamentos que tienen voz y voto en las decisiones no s lo el deportivo
8664798 pero yo soy director deportivo me alegra que los mejores futbolistas est n con nosotros y que los mejores futbolistas puedan venir a este club otra cosa es que la decisi n que es compartida pueda ser asumible acertada y conveniente en eso participamos m s gente
8664799 obedece a la posibilidad o no de venir un media punta
8664800 ver es un jugador que tiene m s manejo que puede ser un jugador m s parecido tambi n al perfil que ped a javier
8664801 tambi n porque es una alternativa m s parecida o m s pr xima a lo que maniche pueda dar que es mucho tambi n por esa situaci n pensamos no tener demasiada gente en medio y que cl ber tuviera un a o de tranquilidad un poco porque creo que hab is sido todos porque yo lo he defendido siempre un poco injustos con l y hab is trasladado a la gente una opini n negativa de un excelente futbolista
8664802 s te dir a que s es injusta la derrota pero nos falt concretar y eso es una parte importante dentro del futbol
8664803 aqu es as entonces cuando no concretas m s all de tener situaciones de dominar el partido es dif cil
8664804 yo me siento bien yo soy jugador del atlante trato de dar todo por mi equipo
8664805 yo simplemente escuch declaraciones irrespetuosas por parte de su entrenador pero no supe nada yo pertenezco a una instituci n de prestigio como el atlante que merece un respeto como mi persona tambi n lo merece entonces seguir trabajando por el beneficio de ambos

8664807 with only a week to go before the premiership it is important that we have strength in depth
8664808 this weekend is all about giving game time to as many players as possible and giving them the opportunity to put their hand up for selection for the worcester match
8664809 both the blues and treviso are used to playing at the highest level in the heineken cup which means that our players will have to put in good performances if they want to stand out
8664810 wont you be more tired since you have not eaten in hours
8664811 a intentar estar siempre pegados a los equipos que s parten con la obligaci n de ganar el torneo
8664812 desde que se fuera todos los d as est muy presente en ese sentido es un d a m s
8664813 no estoy contento faltan cosas por corregir tuvimos un descuido en la marca y lamentablemente cay el gol del empate est bamos manejando bien el partido y no hab a tenido atlas una jugada clara de gol hasta que lleg el descuido de nosotros
8664814 obviamente hay que seguir trabajando tener la mayor concentraci n y hay que trabajarlo para que ya no vuelva a suceder

8664825 from what ive seen over the tournament orangeville has a big run and gun aspect to their offense
8664826 they have the studs up front who can put the ball in the net but it seemed to me they had less chances against us because we ran the floor with them
8664827 all our practices are geared toward orangeville and if we play that way well beat calgary
8664828 now we have a bit of an advantage because we have come up against both teams and we know we can play with them and contend for a w

8664834 it is a draft bill that gives rise to the various new institutions that are being proposed including making nnpc more independent and operational accountable to its shareholder and not just the sort of core center that it is today
8664835 who is responsible for betraying the judiciary zardari is zardari is
8664836 and it is unfortunate that the democratic forces that are in power today they unfortunately are bent upon validating the actions of pervez musharraf
8664837 what we have seen is the emerging economies and developing countries that have been taking the lead it has been really interesting to watch
8664838 many developing countries have come to the table with specific targets with national action plans on climate change
8664839 in poor countries there is less adaptive capacity and there is more vulnerability so when food supplies are affected for example it is harder for a poorer country to be resilient to that to find alternative food sources

8664841 the whole premise is ridiculous that i cant go to a convention party for free but a lobbyist can give me a 10 000 pac check and give you a 4 600 personal contribution

8664843 far in among the marshes and the ridges a light sprang up this light was my forlorn hope i must gain it
8664844 must have the right to return to their homeland and we are discussing the issue with israel and i want to insist on the fact that we are opposed to the implantation of palestinians in lebanon
8664845 one of the aims of the palestinians is to guarantee the human rights for the palestinian community in lebanon which are negated by all the lebanese laws
8664846 until now we are discriminated against and i think the suffering of the palestinians must be ended on the other hand there are a lot of political issues who are not solved between the palestinians and the lebanese one of them is the arms and i think the lebanese have their file and the palestinians have their file so positively i hope they will discuss the matters with much more mature experience of the last decades
8664847 it is by nature to hate those you injure by unknown
8664848 es triste lamentable no pudimos empatar sabemos que tigres es un equipo que se defiende bien y lamentablemente no nos llevamos ni el punto
8664849 ten amos en la mente que se pod a seguir sin perder es algo que se va dando pero que llegas a tener como meta pero no se pudo y pues ahora a ver para adelante porque dentro de todo es s lo una ca da y esto sigue
8664850 no pienso que el equipo sali con el estilo que siempre nos maneja el profe pero tigres se par bien y no se pudo
8664851 tigres se planta muy bien atr s hoy lo hizo y adelante tienen gente muy inteligente que sale al contragolpe bien al ltimo ellos tambi n tuvieron para ampliar el marcador nosotros tambi n pero nos vamos tristes porque pudimos haber hecho m s
8664852 nos vamos mal por ah nosotros tuvimos el control tuvimos demasiado el control del bal n pero ellos tuvieron las opciones y las concretaron
8664853 nosotros tenemos que mejorar siempre el aspecto de la concentraci n nos cuesta mucho que nos hacen siempre el primer gol siempre tenemos que remontar y los equipos se meten atr s las defensas se hacen duras ya nos conocen y es dif cil cargarlo
8664854 entonces hay que trabajar m s la concentraci n y poder empezar ganando un partido de una vez
8664855 s siempre tienes que remar contra la corriente y alguna vez vas a tener que mermar no siempre se va a poder alcanzar y ac por algo tigres es una de las mejores defensas
8664856 hoy ellos se agruparon bien segu an nuestra marca metieron mucho sacrificio y no pudimos vulnerarlos pero repito eso pasa por siempre iniciar abajo

8664859 we have to ensure that we put life in our years not just years on our life extended life expectancy with morbidity in old age spells economic and social catastrophe if we are going to defuse the time bomb of obesity related ill health we must change the behavior of adults today as well as that of our children
8664860 tell people that biology and the environment causes sic obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight young people who think many of their friends binge drink are likely to do so themselves girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behavior and they are classic excuses our need and not just in relation to public health issues is to act on the environment while fostering positive peer pressure and social norms we have to take away the excuses

8664865 places a similar emphasis on self regulation saying the party will work with the drinks industry to improve labeling and consider ways to encourage industry funded promotion of the message of responsible drinking
8664866 rejected criticism of the industry deal saying it was consistent with their approach of seeking to minimize government red tape particularly in areas such as food labeling in which the e u headquarters in brussels was considering mandatory controls the whole approach of the responsibility deals is to use regulation only where necessary a party official said
8664867 once again the tories offer lots of warm words but with very little policy substance everyone believes that individual responsibility matters but the tories are using individual responsibility as an excuse for their lack of effective policies in this area
8664868 want to work with the food industry itself to work out a responsibility charter what a joke its like working with the oil industry to stop global warming this industry is pumping food with preservatives sugar and fat to maximize profit regulation is the only thing that will stop them
8664869 of course it is the fault of the obese they have eaten their way to bad health and no one should take the blame other than themselves i am fed up with fatties complaining about they cant afford to eat properly if they did some proper cooking and walked around instead of waddl ing they would feel much healthier and be much richer it would also help if some of them had a good bath and wore tidy clothes too
8664870 weve done very well in terms of setting policy but very poorly at implementation

8664890 i kind of had a life change and was ready to mature
8664891 something i was always interested in and was kind of scared to go for i just realized i wanted to do something that would be stable and would provide well for me and the girls and i thought that nursing would be it
8664892 i cant tell them not to bother me i dont try studying when the kids are up
8664893 it only has makeshift sanitation facilities and does not have proper handicapped access
8664894 we are going to have make some long hard tough decisions
8664895 firstly we have to find a solution to this problem and secondly we have to find out how to do it and how to pay for it
8664896 well have to make these decisions sooner rather than later
8664897 there was a lot of the negative sentiment going into the quarter for royal having seen whats happened in the u s and the thought process was that they were losing ground in canada
8664898 nothing could be further from the truth with these numbers
8664899 results were ahead of our expectations in the u s and slightly ahead in canada offsetting a weak quarter at td securities
8664900 week one you are going with a lot of faith on what you saw last year and you put bits and pieces together of the whats left on their roster
8664901 thats what makes week one cool because its the only week thats like that after this week well have game film on everybody so theres an element of surprise which makes it exciting
8664902 we dont have speed like last year but we have some speed and this offensive attack forces kids to open field tackle and that isnt easy
8664903 thats always a huge fear that someone will miss their assignments
8664904 we know they run the counter and they throw a little bit
8664905 we have to prepare for the run first and be prepared for the pass
8664906 we lost a lot of explosive kids but this group is excited to show what they can do
8664907 i expect them to be a team that is wanting to prove themselves
8664908 they graduated a lot of seniors and those juniors im sure a lot of people are overlooking them i would think as juniors those guys probably feel they have something to prove they are going to be a tough team
8664909 my sophomore when we won against dunlap it gave us a little bit of a boost
8664910 what are you waiting for a written invitation a public declaration a private consolation remember when you procrastinate you chose last
8664911 and fall to little pieces every time i wonder what clothes you wear to school i wonder how you decorate your room i wonder how you touch yourself and curse myself for being across the sea
8664912 i like pleasure spiked with pain and music is my aeroplane

8664915 when youre dreaming with a broken heart the waking up is the hardest part you roll out of bed and down on your knees and for the moment you can hardly breathe

8664920 its hard to argue if you wont stop making sense
8664921 i get up when im down i cant swim but my soul wont drown i do believe ive got flair ive got speed and i walk on air
8664922 ive been spendin way too long checkin my tongue in the mirror and bendin over backwards just to try to see it clearer my breath fogged up the glass and so i drew a new face and laughed

8664934 in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it
8664935 there is considerable concern among establishments in knox county that you are going to find violations so that you can get inspection money to balance your books
8664936 im not sure if the violations are part of a directive to find more violations to raise revenue
8664937 most of the violations are fairly obvious and we are happy to share all of our information
8664938 with the tough economic times a lot of establishments arent making capital investments and many are using household refrigerators which arent suitable for commercial use especially in warm weather
8664939 im in support of these changes because i think food safety is paramount
8664940 this measure is not going to generate a lot of money
8664941 im not saying youre not doing your job properly but if in six months time you come back here and inspections have gone up 65 or 70 percent youll have some explaining to do
8664942 maybe its just going to take one or two kids to turn williamsfield into a football town i know how they are about their athletics
8664943 if we can get a small flame starting over there itll catch on between the two towns i think we have a chance in the future to turn a lot of heads
8664944 its been dwindling as far as the reality of it
8664945 id ask him how he is doing but the fact that he shows up everyday has proven to me that he is enjoying it
8664946 the kids know the sacrifice he is making i wish we had more guys like him from our school with that kind of work ethic for a kid who has never actually put on a helmet before he has improved by leaps and bounds
8664947 and i am hoping that his success leads to more kids from williamsfield saying hey i could do that
8664948 people are like we dont want to go with galva theres just this opposition of going with galva
8664949 i agree our most ideal choice is brimfield but they dont want us
8664950 theres a lot of kids who miss out who dont get to play
8664951 if he wants to play ill take him up here
8664952 hes a great american and a great and dear friend and i rely on him and i have for many years
8664953 hes a former marine and great guy and hes older than i am so that might work
8664954 those are questions for the mccain campaign and i think they are going to make their announcement shortly

8664962 i listen to my mom but just not on the football field all the time
8664963 willie always said that he wanted to be a professional football player
8664964 so what is the best time to start when youre small to give you the fundamentals
8664965 you have to know at some point that your body and your mind is telling you hey i can go but this is it
8664966 i dont want to be one of those guys thats hanging on not being productive i dont want to be a guy thats just doing a lot of talking from the sidelines

8664971 graeme from the last test match and the start of the one dayers has been pretty much playing on borrowed time with his elbow unfortunately
8664972 he tried to battle it out as much as he could but after trent bridge we just realised he couldnt go any more
8664973 we are going to rest and rehab graeme and get him ready for the start of our home series which is bangladesh in november and then australia we need our guys fighting fit for australia and graeme needs the time off now
8664974 hes such a hard guy and such a driven person that we kept him going and obviously things didnt go according to plan we thought we might get a little cushion and then we could rest him but that hasnt happened
8664975 its a sad situation that ive come in to but well take the opportunity its something that i have done before and i have enjoyed it
8664976 but losing graeme is a huge loss to the side you dont replace guys like that easily
8664977 we pride ourselves on our performance and weve played some good cricket over the last two years
8664978 and the way of performing in the last two games is nowhere near where we should be performing
8664979 it is a changing side but theres no excuse to perform the way we have the pressure is now on england to win the series
8664980 everyone is talking about it saying he has come back for the money but i have come back for cricketing
8664981 it feels like ive been criticised for everything even for changing my socks ive come back for cricketing reasons only
8664982 it was an interesting three or four days leading up to the series i never thought id be anywhere near the games
8664983 they asked me where i was going to be in the winter and then i got a phone call saying ryan sidebottom was injured and they needed somebody so i said why not id never let them down
8664984 its not up to me if i play in the stanford series i made my feelings clear to the coach and captain
8664985 i only agreed to come back after speaking to my wife and children they were the first people i spoke to

8665165 erkl rte coach christoph daum vor der partie im karlsruher wildparkstadion
8665166 zwei drei p nktchen mehr w rden uns ganz gut tun
8665167 in wolfsburg haben wir 45 minuten gut gespielt gegen frankfurt waren es 60 und in karlsruhe sollten es mal 70 bis 75 minuten sein
8665168 sagte daum vorsichtshalber falls die z hler dich beim heimstarken ksc bleiben
8665169 wir werden uns nach und nach in der liga akklimatisieren
8665170 wir haben eine neue mannschaft sind neu in der liga da muss man uns mal zwei oder drei spiele eingestehen
8665171 so franz am vergangenen mittwoch unterzog sich der defensivmann einer kernspintomographie die einen bluterguss im l dierten oberschenkel hervorbrachte
8665172 sagte der 46 jahre alte trainer zu seinem r cktritt nach nur sechs monaten bei den franken ein nachfolger steht indes noch nicht fest die bungseinheiten bernahm vorerst der bisherige assistenzcoach michael oenning
8665173 doch am ende war der riss zwischen teilen des teams und dem bungsleiter wohl un berbr ckbar
8665174 der trainer hat ja deutlich genug kundgetan dass er sich hier nicht wohl f hlt
8665175 der start in die 2 liga war die zweite entt uschung
8665176 nicht nachvollziehbar f r mich ist nach zwei spieltagen einen trainer komplett infrage zu stellen wider besseren wissens dass eine neu formierte verj ngte mannschaft zeit zur entwicklung braucht

8665181 he is completely distraught all of them are his family his girlfriend
8665182 i have no doubt that his makeup in this case a definable disorder led him to commit this crime
8665183 i cant wait to see this scene in the movie
8665184 the initial agreement has been signed and we are waiting to see the approval of both governments
8665185 now let me ask you whose judgment should we trust
8665186 should we trust john mccains judgment when he said only three years ago afghanistan we dont read about it anymore because its succeeded or should we trust barack obama who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to afghanistan
8665187 the fact is al qaida and the taliban the people who actually attacked us on 9 11 have regrouped in those mountains between afghanistan and pakistan and are plotting new attacks
8665188 and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff echoed baracks call for more troops john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8665189 as ive said many times we must be as careful getting out of iraq as we were careless getting in
8665190 we can safely redeploy our combat brigades at a pace that would remove them in 16 months that would be the summer of 2010 two years from now and more than seven years after the war began after this redeployment a residual force in iraq would perform limited missions going after any remnants of al qaeda in mesopotamia protecting american service members and so long as the iraqis make political progress training iraqi security forces that would not be a precipitous withdrawal
8665191 ending the war is essential to meeting our broader strategic goals starting in afghanistan and pakistan where the taliban is resurgent and al qaeda has a safe haven iraq is not the central front in the war on terrorism and it never has been
8665192 as adm mike mullen the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff recently pointed out we wont have sufficient resources to finish the job in afghanistan until we reduce our commitment to iraq
8665193 i would pursue a new strategy and begin by providing at least two additional combat brigades to support our effort in afghanistan we need more troops more helicopters better intelligence gathering and more nonmilitary assistance to accomplish the mission there i would not hold our military our resources and our foreign policy hostage to a misguided desire to maintain permanent bases in iraq
8665194 we will finally make the fight against al qaeda and the taliban the top priority that it should be we will send at least two additional combat brigades to afghanistan and use this commitment to seek greater contributions with fewer restrictions from our nato allies
8665195 we will focus on building up our special forces and intelligence capacity training equipping and advising afghan security forces building afghan governmental capacity and promoting the rule of law
8665196 we will bolster our state departments provincial reconstruction teams and our other government agencies helping the afghan people
8665197 we will help afghans educate their children including their girls provide basic human services to their population and grow their economy from the bottom up with an additional 1 billion in non military assistance each year including investments in alternative livelihoods to poppy growing for afghan farmers just as we crack down on trafficking and corruption
8665198 the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam
8665199 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years a philosophy we never had a real chance to see in action until 2001 when the republicans finally gained control of both the white house and congress then we saw what would happen to america if the policies they had talked about for decades were implemented
8665200 they took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs down to 5 million from an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 1 2 million falling into poverty and millions more losing their health insurance
8665201 now in spite of all the evidence their candidate is promising more of the same more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans that will swell the deficit increase inequality and weaken the economy more band aids for health care that will enrich insurance companies impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured more going it alone in the world instead of building the shared responsibilities and shared opportunities necessary to advance our security and restore our influence
8665202 the airoli data centre is a key facet of our strategy to develop the most sophisticated network and data centre infrastructure in the country to facilitate the evolution and demand for services such as ecommerce online banking corporate erp and other applications media and entertainment content stock trading unified communications and disaster recovery in the country our ability to offer a comprehensive solution using the hosting services and the mpls vpn connectivity services enable us to be a leader in the market we lead in such mission critical services across the bfsi manufacturing services media and retail verticals and can extend our leadership across verticals with this centre the airoli centre will be followed by at least two more one each in new delhi and bangalore over the next eight quarters
8665203 we have been investing for growth in the capacity of our backbone infrastructure expansion of the network to over 500 points of presence and the adoption of new technologies and standards to move towards being a next generation network for converged services the airoli data centre at an investment when complete of 36 million rs 150 crores is a significant part of this process and greatly strengthens our ability to deliver sophisticated services now and in the future our total investment in data centres over the next two years is likely to be about 100 million rs 400 crores to meet the growing demand for such services from both the domestic market and overseas markets

8665210 by the way if i hear one more time obama was 11 years old when i went to the senate im going to smack someone
8665211 there are only four senators seniors to me but there are 44 older
8665212 this isnt about me trying to fit biden and obama together its a natural fit
8665213 barack obama could have made that speech were he alive in 1972
8665214 its about putting the right level of technical support for the right audience

8665293 the problem is when you define beauty to incorporate white which it essentially does at abercrombie these rating systems remain legal as long as they dont discriminate based on race or gender

8665295 its only appropriate that barack obama would descend down from the heavens and spend a little time with us mere mortals when accepting the democratic nomination
8665296 we would have expected to read something like this in the onion fortunately for us its true unfortunately for obama its true
8665297 its higher than what we have now but its not that much more because its worded in terms of percentage of effort rather than of the cap
8665298 the annual use of credits offsets by installations shall not exceed a quantity equal to 25 percent of the greenhouse gas emission reductions required for the installations covered compared to the average emissions of the installations concerned in the period 2008 to 2012
8665299 the security camera snaps still photos every 3 seconds but the images we were shown had several second gaps between images and several different images had exactly the same time stamp in my mind i was sure that someone had tampered with the evidence to hide the truth
8665300 there was no logical explanation given as to why this decision was made
8665301 the evidence that i saw was clear and i think the average person viewing it would reach the same conclusion that tiller intentionally struck gietzen with his jeep and efforts were made to cover it up
8665302 this is another example of officials excusing tillers criminal acts it also creates a dangerous atmosphere for peaceful pro lifers outside of tillers clinic the next time tiller snaps he may kill someone and the responsibility for that will rest directly at the doorstep of district attorney nola foulston

8665334 the first right of the human person is his life it does not belong to society nor does it belong to public authority in any form to recognize this right for some and not others from the time the ovum is fertilized a life is begun which is neither that of the father nor of the mother it is rather the life of a new human being
8665335 source name may leak at 6 pm et with some sort of confirmation at 8 pm
8665336 hes going to be talking directly to his opponent so im going to leave it there but its going be very exciting i think that a lot of people are going to focus on it
8665337 be careful not to do your acts of righteousness before men to be seen by them
8665338 so when you give to the needy do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by men i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full
8665339 and when you pray do not be like the hypocrites for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full an audience of one
8665340 please she could probably teach me something on the catwalk
8665341 we put her in a bathing suit and there was nothing dangling
8665342 over the past 15 years there have been several highly successful ones
8665343 i know five easy whore passing as women doing shows with really great careers and no one knew well i knew so the great thing about isis is that she actually goes into this competition with no luggage per se the struggles of her formerly being a man arent hindering her challenges just everything else that makes modeling difficult shes just one of the girls
8665344 shes on a high right now but her life goes in circles
8665345 its like a roller coaster ride shes a person who is highly sensitive and just one little thing could set her off
8665346 at 15 she had a huge breakdown and had to return home to louisiana
8665347 she was very insecure and felt like she wasnt pretty
8665348 theres no doubt based on the last two years that she is a highly unstable person
8665349 shes on a temporary high right now but shes never really dealt with all the problems she had i dont think its possible to turn over a new leaf just like that
8665350 in fact shes nicer than most of the stars ive met but as britney once told me herself her life has always been two steps forward followed by one step back
8665351 my dad who fell on hard economic times always told me champ when you get knocked down get up
8665352 failure at some point in your life is inevitable but giving up is unforgivable
8665353 i am here for everyone i grew up with in scranton and wilmington
8665354 i am here for the cops and firefighters the teachers and assembly line workers the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the american dream endures our greatest presidents from they all challenged us to embrace change now its our responsibility to meet that challenge millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up back up together our debt to our parents and grandparents is too great our obligation to our children is too sacred
8665355 assisted with the governments investigation of scores of other persons who have not yet been charged
8665356 im sure theres going to be a rather difficult period in our discussions
8665357 if it goes in the direction of aggravating relations its not going to be our choice
8665358 i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
8665359 it will create new pressures on the regional level throughout the caucasus and further complicates international affairs among the powers of the world
8665360 their use of force against south ossetia clearly dashed all of those previous resolutions and created a completely new reality
8665361 there is no way you can dash or cancel or
8665362 so in the space of three weeks russia has gone from reaffirming georgias territorial integrity to using military force to redraw the boundaries of georgia
8665363 i truly miss the girls but this has been a vision of mine for the last seven years and now its finally going to the big screen its the next evolution of music and performance i hope the pussycat dolls have a reunion one day and id totally perform with them again
8665364 a rock n roll version of cirque du soleil which is a musically driven theatre show with specialty acts comprised of incredible talent
8665365 continue to expect a serious injury rather than an injury rather than an outright death as a result of the suv explosion
8665366 we know the fans love all our characters equally and because of that they have some job security
8665367 yes in other words a j and j j will be giving birth all but simultaneously on tv and in real life once she goes on maternity leave however what happens to the liaison post she vacates
8665368 continuing a tradition of asking world class actresses to come join us on medium i am thrilled to announce that blythe danner will appear in one of the early episodes of season 5
8665369 in it they just solve one or two cases a week but in real life the police have to deal with hundreds of cases
8665370 to be perfectly frank i said to naren shankar and carol mendelsohn when we met here in new york that i felt a little stupid and embarrassed that i hadnt watched the show prior to having a meeting with them but im happy to say that the episodes they sent me to look at were really engaging and really wonderful and kind of dark and moody like a lot of the work ive actually been involved in
8665371 the no 1 nuclear energy products and services vendor in america
8665372 the two deputy medical directors told us that local medical teams had been coping with the emergency under highly difficult circumstances
8665373 and that the russian authorities had very quickly rushed large quantities of material assistance to the scene
8665374 the exact nature of any additional possible needs hasnt been determined yet
8665375 i am really excited and cant wait for it all to begin
8665376 its a tough competition where all 12 teams are capable of beating each other at home or away to win the guinness premiership you have to be fit smart skilful aggressive and hard working these are the very things that we have been working on in pre season
8665377 telephone answering device linking displayed data with recorded audio message
8665378 large scale exports of fresh water would be a wealth creating idea for quebec and all of canada its urgent to look seriously at developing our blue gold
8665379 canadas precious fresh water resource belongs to the people and cannot be bundled and privatized at the whim of government and corporate interests
8665380 water is a fundamental human right and any attempt to divert or export it whether to the u s or saudi arabia must defer to whats in the broad canadian public interest
8665381 in a pre election cycle theres great pressure from corporations to allow the export of fresh water if quebec went ahead other provinces would have to follow
8665382 my bill was intended as a safety measure before a water crisis blows up ill bring it back if theres an election but 90 per cent of canadas fresh water is under provincial control and that complicates things
8665383 we began the study months ago and it is a follow up to the one we did last year on the privatization of hydro qu bec we dont really know how much fresh water we have or whether exporting it would make economic sense but weve got to think about it and be ready if the issue comes to the boil further down the road
8665384 they are politically charged of course and i dont see the government acting at present
8665385 i could use a trashy boyfriend off to the piercing shop
8665386 its only appropriate that barack obama would descend down from the heavens and spend a little time with us mere mortals when accepting the democratic nomination
8665387 weve done britneys sets and a whole bunch of rock shows but this was far more elaborate and complicated and we had to do it in far less time
8665388 the biggest challenge has been making sure we dont damage the playing field underneath
8665389 before mccain can debate obama he needs to finish the debate with himself
8665390 congratulations to michael phelps and all of the u s athletes
8665391 hey good job you know like swimming and stuff i like your dog
8665392 as of wednesday a google search for joe biden or even just biden
8665393 at the planet were committed to offering cost effective hosting solutions for our smb customers by discounting a variety of servers from celerons to xeons to our ready to go servers tm were making it easier and more affordable than ever to host with the planet
8665394 with this agreement goldman sachs will provide financing to allow us to further our business objectives
8665395 a deal of this magnitude will allow us to continue investing in the infrastructures which are vital to maintaining our growth which has been outstanding thus far

8665397 the power of our example than by the example of our power
8665398 a u s air strike south of herat in western afghanistan has killed more than 50 innocent civilians including women and children
8665399 the taliban and their supporters are running a very effective propaganda campaign to discredit coalition efforts exaggerated claims of damage often result in demands for more money in compensation
8665400 we need to have americas help to win this fight your enemy is our enemy
8665401 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8665402 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8665403 he got into the files just yesterday so we wanted to have him on to find out what he found and if at all possible we wanted to get the obama campaign to get their side of the story
8665404 thats why the uproar is kind of amazing because we wanted the obama campaigns take as well to kind of balance it out
8665405 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8665406 you cant hang with an unrepentant terrorist and then want to get elected as commander in chief to lead a global war on terror
8665407 i will let no one question my love of this country
8665408 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he barack obama is the presidency is not something that lends its self to on the job training
8665409 remember you are only mortal and all glory is fast fadeing
8665410 everything here from the thesps heavy mugging to the uncustomarily overbearing score by carter burwell and the artificially augmented vulgarities in the dialogue has been dialed up to an almost grotesquely exaggerated extent making for a film that feels misjudged nothing about the projects execution inspires the feeling that this was ever intended as anything more than a lark which would be fine if it were a good one as it is audience teeth grinding sets in early and never lets up
8665411 joel and ethan coen clearly are in a prankish mood knocking out a minor piece of silliness with all the trappings of an a list studio movie
8665412 ive spoken to another critic who saw it and was asking himself as he watched the first two acts why am i not laughing
8665413 burn after reading may also go down as arguably the coens happiest engagement with the demands of the hollywood a list but this bit of career development may also be contributing to a diminishing of their particular film making strengths in comparison to ncfom the film is a bit of a bantamweight fast moving lots of attitude and uncorking a killer punch when it can
8665414 gave me a great opportunity to get back in the game
8665415 what came first the chicken nugget or the egg mcmuffin
8665416 this kind of flower dont grow on earth just letting you know for what its worth
8665417 i dont see the point of a partnership it wont be long till they start to trip
8665418 they came from mars women came from venus we think with our brains men think its all meaningless
8665419 im 100 convinced i wouldnt need to turn into a lesbian if me and the boys could just stop disagreeing on just about everything
8665420 im a much better woman did a 12 step program and now i can drink again
8665421 do not think that this year is your last year as head of the government no act as if you will stay in charge for five years
8665422 a country with abundant resources should not have gas cuts in winter and power cuts in summer or have people spending hours in line waiting at gas stations i have previously discussed in this column how the ayatollahs regime is besieged by insurmountable political crisis threatening its survival as never before after nearly three decades of rule the clerical regime is marred by financial and moral corruption it depends on tyranny at home and expansion of its islamic fundamentalist rule abroad to stay afloat to appreciate this crisis at the very top of tehrans leadership one must understand the set of domestic and foreign imperatives that compelled khamenei in 2005 to throw his full weight behind the presidency of ahmadinejad then an obscure mayor of tehran please see the iran threat president ahmadinejad and the coming nuclear crisis palgrave february 2008 for more details in early 2003 with the invasion of iraq looming and tehrans nuclear program exposed by the main iranian dissident group the peoples mojahedin of iran pmoi mek khamenei made a do or die decision advance the nuclear program and agenda for iraq by catapulting the islamic revolutionary guards corps into the political foreground khameneis strategy supported by the irgcs top brass was simple there is window of opportunity before the curtain falls on us we have to advance full speed with an inward and outward belligerence there is no time to fool around with charm campaigns indeed in an apparent jab at the mullahs reformist president mohammad khatami khamenei remarked on saturday that the government of ahmadinejad has stopped the process of westernization and secularization that had begun to infiltrate the decision making processes of the country
8665423 ive known lesleys brother for a long time so i used to help her when she cheered for the argos and when she started coaching ticats i offered to help she wanted someone who wasnt too creepy you know
8665424 it worked really well but make sure you soak it in water later because the tape took a layer of my skin off

8665430 eu me encarrego de tudo do que valentino n o gosta
8665431 we congratulate stu on an outstanding playing career and we are very excited that he will now join our coaching staff
8665432 stu was a consummate professional on and off the ice throughout his career and was the type of player who always exhibited the qualities you would associate with a future coach stu will be an excellent addition to our staff which we feel is among the best in the league
8665433 it may be a function of social perceptions of alcohol in that particular region
8665434 it has had a very negative impact on our day to day life
8665435 our interest is in the continuity of record keeping and that when you generate a document during an investigation its public information
8665436 you dont take it with you and you dont claim that you did it on your own time
8665437 come to the locker room after the game and ill sign it
8665438 play fair take a nap every afternoon live a balanced life and when you go out in the world watch out for traffic hold hands and stick together
8665439 we think it likely that most of the increase in capital spending implied by the durable goods data is being undertaken by companies benefiting from the export boom the domestic economy remains very weak indeed the risk must be that in time the combination of slowing global growth and a stronger dollar crimps exports but for now they are the lifeline
8665440 it was never a sensible idea but it was a particularly stupid tax in the current economic circumstances
8665441 i feel very strongly about it it is an unfair tax it penalises regeneration opportunities and it is then that buildings will get demolished more quickly and we are seeing signs of that already
8665442 the uk commercial property market has been seeing valuations fall since june of last year and our portfolio fell by nearly 400m in the first half of this year
8665443 our leasing levels have remained strong with low occupier insolvency levels in line with recent years
8665444 our european performance has been very good this year and counter balances what has been happening in the uk
8665445 our results this morning are terrific and they only underscore why there is much more value in this business than that represented by the offer from wpp
8665446 the board is completely clear that our advice to shareholders is not to accept and to insist that anybody who wants to buy the company recognises its value
8665447 we are just glad that gfk has finally clarified the position or the non position
8665448 advertising trends have continued to deteriorate and future performance will inevitably be linked to the eco nomies of the uk and to a lesser extent the republic of ireland
8665449 media companies fit for the modern world need to be lean and agile
8665450 the current structure of industry is unsustainable in the long term
8665451 the law is looking increasingly outdated and i would expect a major test case in the next couple of years
8665452 housing is at the centre of the national economic problem
8665453 the current operating environment in the uk housing market remains very challenging and we do not anticipate any recovery in the short term
8665454 the process is going fine and we would hope to complete in the next few weeks it is a detailed process but there are no roadblocks
8665455 in our view the key thing is that no conclusions have been reached yet we believe that there are too many negatives surrounding the taylor wimpey statement at the current time
8665456 b amp b is being implicitly backed by the major uk banks and the government in our opinion but this remains a volatile situation and we can see far better returns in larger more liquid stocks such as hbos
8665457 given the challenges facing the banking sector following the credit crisis coupled with a domestic economy on the edge of recession we are of the opinion that the uk banking sector is facing a long road to recovery as a result we expect share prices to remain depressed over the medium term we believe that long term interest in uk banks will only start to emerge when there is evidence of a stabilising environment in us and in particular us house prices in addition we believe that investors will only start to regain confidence in the future profitability of uk banks further down the economic cycle
8665458 against this backdrop we are looking to identify a relative shelter from the storm we believe barclays is the best placed amongst our uk banking universe with its relatively defensive uk banking profile its international diversification and its investment banking franchise which barclays has moved to strengthen in light of difficulties facing its peers
8665459 we believe that substantial downside risks are priced into the stock and that there is significant potential upside if management is able to execute through its difficult patch successfully
8665460 more solid reassurance about the security of consensus dividend estimates and pension funding will have a compounding effect in our view given the risk discount that we now see in the stock this is the first time we have rated bt buy since october 2000
8665461 rising cost of raw materials could result in a recessionary trend for the industry
8665462 margin is lower in corus as it does not have captive raw material that is something we are trying to change
8665463 we first want to get security of raw material then ownership
8665464 im afraid of heights im not a big fan of the water i dont ski or snowboard and i dont skateboard
8665465 so when red bull asked me to go drifting i was all over it
8665466 for me drifting is more about the personal reward of being able to overcome vehicle dynamics and do things that cars are not supposed to do to position a car in an out of control state yet sustain control
8665467 im not really into cars i dont own a lot of cars i just love to drive
8665468 ive been pretty fortunate that ive been able to do it the last couple of years
8665469 tony stewart has been awful good to me after the race ill get on a helicopter with tony and fly to the airport well get on his plane and hell drop me off at the carbondale ill airport ill hop in the rental car grab a shower at the hotel and then meet the boys in the lobby because i think practice is at 9 a m
8665470 tony and i usually talk all the way to illinois which isnt that long of a flight its three and a half hours or something but when youre going through those time zones you get on the plane at 11 p m in fontana and youre all pumped up and then its 5 a m in illinois when you land its kind of like oh shoot this could be a long day weve won duquoin the last two years so were looking forward to going back there
8665471 youve got this circle you sit in a car youve only got a couple of pedals that do anything and you go around the circle as fast as you can
8665472 were willing to take less for shipping because we think youll buy five more items from us as opposed to if we got as much as we could from you shipping this product you may never buy again

8665479 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8665480 the asians are killing our tour absolutely killing it their lack of emotion their refusal to speak english when they can speak english they rarely speak
8665481 how can this occur in this day and age were pretty outraged

8665515 zelden heeft een partij zo enthousiast meegewerkt aan de eigen vernietiging als agalev
8665516 centraal in de fiscale behandeling staat het dubbelbelastingverdrag tussen belgi en china uit 1996
8665517 deze overeenkomst heeft immers voorrang op de belgische wetgeving normaliter wordt elke belastingplichtige in zijn woonplaats belast artikel 17 van het verdrag wijst echter de heffingsbevoegdheid over inkomsten uit sportprestaties toe aan het land waar de activiteiten plaatsvinden ongeacht waar de werkgever gevestigd is
8665518 vergoedingen voor fotoshoots en naamsgebruik zijn echter geen sportieve prestaties
8665519 maar de atleten zullen moeten aantonen dat de reguliere werkgever deze vaste vergoeding betaald heeft voor de prestaties tijdens de olympische spelen in china
8665520 dat valt echter moeilijk te bewijzen bovendien betaalt het boic normaliter alle verplaatsing en verblijfkosten

8665533 turnover would be a milestone for american officials who have said that reduced violence in the western province shows that a partnership there with the local forces known as awakening councils has been successful
8665534 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
8665535 remains a dangerous place but the ever growing ability of the iraqi security forces continues to move us closer to seeing iraqi control of the province
8665536 turnaround in anbar is all the more dramatic for what it might mean for afghanistan
8665537 make it likely that a us buildup in afghanistan will follow a drawdown in iraq
8665538 made a strong pitch to send thousands of additional marines or other us troops to afghanistan voicing agreement with us commanders there who have said for years that they have too small a force and have called for as many as 10 000 more troops

8665544 has been mocking the setting of obamas speech he is delivering it on the 50 yard line at invesco field home of the denver broncos as well as the stage set which the mccain team labeled the temple of obama
8665545 as a fatuous celebrity not ready to be commander in chief
8665546 in the latest installment of its audacity watch series of press releases on obama
8665547 has gambled on the historic moment by creating a stage that will magnify his performance
8665548 senior democratic officials are expressing serious concerns about the political risks posed by barack obamas acceptance speech at invesco field at mile high stadium thursday evening
8665549 the obama campaign is engaging in a high risk endeavor in an uncontrollable environment
8665550 could cancel out any effort to strike a chord with voters angry at republicans but unsure whether obama is a candidate of substance and not just as republicans have said a celebrity short on experience and ability
8665551 how he differs from john mccain and portraying his republican rival as out of touch
8665552 wont hesitate to express his views on president bush and mccain
8665553 he is going to make a case about the choices that people face he is going to make a respectful argument but i dont think he will shy away from making those contrasts where they are appropriate
8665554 had substantially finished the text but would probably continue to edit it right up until he delivers it thursday night
8665555 said obama had looked to past nominating speeches as models including bill clintons in 1992 ronald reagans in 1980 and john f kennedys in 1960
8665556 when obama speaks tonight the words will be largely his own a personal message to americans about the choice they will make in november
8665557 he knows what he wants and he generally says it better than anybody could
8665558 directly addressed the issue on which his wife had hit mr obama hardest during the primaries and on which republicans have pounded all summer mr obamas experience
8665559 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8665560 whether you love bill clinton or are on the opposing side on the campaign what you saw there tonight was the gift that so frustrated republicans and made democrats so happy
8665561 at first it seemed it might be all about bill clinton and yesteryear
8665562 it is the most repetitive theme of clintons political life that he always finds a path to redemption when he is down and in many ways he proved that again with this speech
8665563 an effort to fully close out the lingering animosity from the primary season
8665564 he gave the best argument offered thus far on the third day of the convention for barack obama he gave a comprehensive view domestically and internationally it wasnt his endorsement tonight that mattered but what he did do is he set a theme restoring the american dream at home and americas leadership abroad
8665565 i thought the master has arrived crazy bill the red faced rageaholic was somewhere else this was deft political pro bill doing what no one had been able to do up to this point at the convention and that is make the case for barack obama
8665566 just a moment ago history was made by this party for the first time an african american is the nominee of a major political party they went through the roll call and then they went to new york and it was up to hillary clinton to move to make the nomination unanimous
8665567 madame secretary on behalf of the great state of new york with appreciation for the spirit and dedication of all who are gathered here with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8665568 a remarkable achievement in what has been a remarkable ascendance
8665569 it was a scripted scenario the outcome never in doubt but when history arrived on the floor of the democratic national convention on wednesday afternoon it came with the full force of emotion
8665570 was the climax of a campaign that intertwined two groups that have spent much of the past 50 years struggling for their place at the table of american politics blacks and women and it came at the hands of the woman who had tried so hard to wrest it from him
8665571 joyous scene on the convention floor as delegates danced to the strains of love train and then broke out in chants of yes we can yes we can when the music finally stopped
8665572 made an unannounced appearance with biden on the convention podium after the vice presidential nominee addressed the convention the presidential nominee said he was so proud to have biden on the ticket
8665573 offered a hint of the pit bull role he will likely play in the fall campaign
8665574 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8665575 when bidens brother and son wanted to buy a hedge fund company two years ago they turned for financing to a law firm that had lobbied the delaware senators office on an important piece of business in congress and in fact had recently benefited from his vote the firm promised james and hunter biden that it would invest 2 million and quickly delivered half of it
8665576 deal eventually fell through and the money was returned but it highlighted the close ties that joe biden and his family have developed with simmonscooper an illinois law firm that specializes in asbestos litigation a multimillion dollar line of business that was under threat in congress
8665577 netapp has a commanding presence in the nas network attached storage space which would be attractrive to any enterprise hardware company
8665578 however given timing and finances we believe there is only one possibility as a candidate ibm
8665579 the midori incubation developed under eric rudder and thats basically taking the concepts of singularity which is a totally managed net collected os and investigating ways to make the operating system really scalable across different nodes and asynchronous responsive and theyve got this asynchronous programming model theyre building on top of that
8665580 as far as the future of windows and windows being something not based on what windows is today im working in windows im not working in midori im not working in some other incubation so i think that kind of answers the question right there about what i think will happen to windows and that is that the future will be windows of some kind
8665581 it just doesnt make sense to me what amazes me is that people just say lets throw everything away and start over because theres so much thats been invested in things that are in windows
8665582 if you look at how much work has been put into the kernel the windows kernel is in my opinion and the numbers back this up the most scalable kernel the one that supports the most drivers of any kernel hardware devices than any kernel on the planet if you just focus on the pc hardware and server class hardware
8665583 and thats just a huge investment a huge asset that weve got and i dont think that it makes sense to just toss that it does a great job and its not perfect and theres no kernel thats perfect or os thats perfect but thats probably million of man years of work thats gone into tuning it and designing it and implementing it

8665614 he would tell them that theyd get set up with all the premium stuff
8665615 they were happy with the way the club has dealt with it
8665616 they just wanted some things clarified after the meeting they were very keen for the relationship to continue
8665617 the sponsor was actually keen to stick solid with the club
8665618 but it is a reminder that there can be commercial ramifications where the image of the game is damaged
8665619 my client wishes to advise that she is concentrating on her recovery as this is the paramount consideration at this point in time
8665620 she has expressed some disappointment in the number of inaccuracies contained in much of the media coverage of the incident however under legal advice she has not yet released her statement of events
8665621 theyre all good theyve taken a very professional approach to this
8665622 its been very tough on them because gregs a close mate of us all but we have to be very focused on our football in our attitude and approach to this game against tigers
8665623 as his coach and a friend i see it as my responsibility to make sure hes ok and handling the situation as best he can i also have great sympathy for the victim
8665624 there comes a time when every dog has to be put down
8665625 our plan is to leave no doubt about the outcome
8665626 we dont want it to be close on the scorecard
8665627 you know how i fight you know my style nothings gonna change
8665628 i go in the ring with one thing in mind win
8665629 hit him more than he hits me pavliks style is self explanatory im a throwback
8665630 this fight has the potential to go either way both sides have the potential to taste canvas
8665631 and he did it after he got knocked down which impressed me
8665632 to me this wednesdays event is saying boxing is still alive im glad to be a part of it
8665633 just that first 20 minutes but once you push through that first 20 you find your second wind
8665634 its hard to explain its a moment where you just feel so fatigued and so out of breath so short of breath you just have to push through
8665635 youve got the little voice going on inside your head you push through and you are able to get that second wind
8665636 the second wind normally comes around the second half once youve had the break and i suppose the game has slowed down a touch and everyone is buggered but you continue on
8665637 theres a few things you change or i suppose you become aware of
8665638 you set a little bit deeper in kick receipt situations
8665639 you allow the ball to fly an extra 15 to 20 metres because it does fly a lot more at altitude
8665640 i suppose i rode the whole game with those guys from the bench ive never been so into a game and after it i was so tired
8665641 i accepted the fact i couldnt be out there the most disappointing thing was i didnt get to share the win with them that excitement you experience on the field
8665642 i was very happy for everyone in the squad to get the win but i felt disappointed that i couldnt really be a part of it
8665643 the all blacks applied a lot of pressure in my area
8665644 i basically couldnt do anything with that i felt almost useless ill be looking to go out there and make the most of it
8665645 theyve done it before so yeah weve got to go out and play well
8665646 were off a break were i guess under a bit of pressure and its up to these guys now its up to us to put our hands up and perform well and basically if they play good cricket we have to match it
8665647 weve been working since the start of the year to look for suitable sites
8665648 special user fees on botox body oil and bikini waxes
8665649 by incarcerating everyone at 18 we can save billions on higher education and get new efficiencies in our corrections system

8665652 although 85 percent of californians are not aware theres a budget crisis
8665653 the findings suggest theyll be ticked off if they find out
8665654 let us sit down and settle this like manly men

8665659 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8665660 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8665661 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8665662 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8665663 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8665664 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8665665 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8665666 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8665667 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8665668 this crowd is like one at an ice cream stand
8665669 im a 20 year veteran and im old school ive been fighting promoters and everybody else all my life ive stood up against all the big guys thats why all the guys in hard hats love b hop
8665670 but im fighting a legend you know what im going to do every fight its not going to change
8665671 we thought we had a deal with welterweight champion paul williams
8665672 then they pulled out it kept coming back to hopkins as the only choice out there
8665673 i didnt lose that fight and i didnt lose to taylor
8665674 the world saw it fighters want to stay busy and a true fighter wants to fight the best kelly is a true fighter he won the title the right way by knocking the guy out there was no controversy

8665678 finals are out of reach for the blues so fevolas ton could be a realistic goal for the team to strive for
8665679 it will be hard to kick eight goals against the competitions second best team but its not impossible especially if brendan has his kicking boot on this week
8665680 hes kicked eight goals before this year so i dare say a few of us will have the blinkers on going inside the forward 50
8665681 but the main thing for us is still to perform strongly as a group and if fev was to kick eight thatd be the icing on the cake
8665682 i think we need to make sure that we get the score on the board you dont want to deflate other players around trying to get that 100 goals
8665683 when you look back at history i had a week off going into the fremantle game and id like to think it made a difference
8665684 it was a bit frustrating initially knowing my role would be different but it was good to be able to go forward and play well against fremantle and get some goals
8665685 obviously last week against collingwood was a bit different not getting involved in the play too much
8665686 i definitely think theres a role up forward for me to get involved with goals and create a contest
8665687 playing in the forward line reduces the load on the groin and the body so it is better managed than what it was during the season
8665688 i think the way we played on the weekend definitely you would have to agree with that
8665689 we really didnt play with much flair from the backline and our forward line wasnt operating too well either collingwood smashed us as theyve done the last few times
8665690 weve got an opportunity this week to change that perception of roosy
8665691 for ourself and our team confidence weve got the chance to go into the finals with a win under our belt playing some really good football which we know we can do
8665692 as a senior group were not happy with the form we as leaders are producing at the moment
8665693 weve got something to prove as a group to each other that we can play better football we do it in glimpses but we need a consistent effort over the full four quarters
8665694 im still not getting the respect i think i deserve
8665695 im not sure why people believe that ive had it easy for some reason maybe because i was part of the contender the first season of the unscripted tv show i dont know but i know theres still a lot of skepticism towards me
8665696 i cant get caught slipping going into this rematch i have to win again i have to look even better this time and little by little change peoples minds
8665697 but theres always going to be critics i dont care i got the confirmation of my abilities when i beat vernon the first time and my opinion means a whole lot more than my critics
8665698 we sparred before he says he got the better of me but i did well it was even sparring so he knew what to expect from me
8665699 maybe he was over trained but if that was the case then why did he come in over weight for the first fight if youve over trained shouldnt you be under weight or at least at weight
8665700 i started slow because i had no warm up time
8665701 but i was still confident i tasted his power early and i knew i could take it by the fifth round i knew i could set the tempo
8665702 there are some tricks up my sleeve that i didnt use in the first fight
8665703 a lot of the little dirty tactics and some good tactics too
8665704 this is one of the shortest breaks between fights in my pro career except for when i was on the contender and if you noticed i was very sharp during the show so ive had no time to get out of shape or lose my focus and its going to show in my performance
8665705 id be lying if i said it didnt affect my concentration
8665706 if de la hoya looks in your direction you pay attention but i cant let it divert my focus on this fight
8665707 it could be a business ploy on his part they could be using my name as a negotiating tool with pacquiaos people
8665708 make a major announcement regarding the ten time champions immediate future
8665709 arum and them want to put that into the contract
8665710 i dont care i mean it i didnt say it to sell the fight i said it because i believe it
8665711 if manny gets the fight with de la hoya i would want his next fight to be against hatton at 140 pounds
8665712 but i hear that hatton is calling out mayweather for a rematch and i know for a fact that mayweather is training in las vegas so maybe wed have to wait for that one
8665713 he definitely looks better than he did before the casamayor fight if he had the form hes showing now before the casamayor fight i think he would have beat casamayor
8665714 he looks a lot better now than he did for casamayor
8665715 the last time i sparred with katsidis he just stood in front of me wanting to go toe to toe
8665716 now hes moving more he doesnt stand in one place and hes also working on his counter punching
8665717 hes good when he boxes im thinking that he can beat diaz and i wouldnt have said that last year
8665718 the name doesnt mean much until youve seen me fight
8665719 he didnt have any amateur fights but he can fight
8665720 calderon sparred with oscar in the first week of his camp for mayweather
8665721 really well oscar has trouble with smaller guys i know this
8665722 o aeroporto da ota seria um projecto estruturante para o pa s e para a regi o assegurava o desenvolvimento multiplicava as empresas e criava postos de trabalho e este plano n o consegue servir como contrapartida
8665723 as infra estruturas que vir o para a regi o s o positivas mas n o compensam devidamente o que seria ter um aeroporto
8665724 foram definidos como objecto de interven o 59 projectos de iniciativa do governo e 61 da iniciativa dos munic pios
8665725 this confirms that there is west nile virus activity locally and it is a reminder that we should take steps to avoid mosquito bites
8665726 but once we did we were hooked we feel the punches
8665727 hes a great kid and were really very proud of him
8665728 our key of love it opens our hearts for our hometown champion
8665729 we won a comp in 2005 on the back of those young kids we have gone with young blokes but you cant put an old head on young shoulders
8665730 for the last two years ohara has had shocking injuries
8665731 sam harris was a representative player when we bought him it didnt work out
8665732 john morris hasnt missed a game since he came to the club
8665733 at the end of the day theres not a player in the joint whose signature he did not approve
8665734 i havent won too many of these grand slam matches so this feels pretty good
8665735 it was really about self belief i am feeling more and more comfortable in best of five set matches and i thought i handled it pretty well today
8665736 i played him twice this year already and its one all he beat me pretty convincingly last time so hopefully i can get a bit of revenge
8665737 right now my confidence is pretty high ive been playing pretty well these last four or five weeks so im feeling good
8665738 i was a little bit disappointed with the way he served the point before
8665739 thats a good strategy during the match but it was almost over he realised it was kind of a mistake
8665740 a man who has committed a mistake and doesnt correct it is committing another mistake
8665741 yo comenc a hacerlo personalmente y para clientes privados no clientes del banco privados individuales a quienes yo conoc a transacciones de deuda por inversi n eso es un ejemplo de lo que es un cabildero
8665742 yo viajaba con el presidente de la rep blica dominicana alrededor del mundo y para todos lados haciendo negocios para la rep blica dominicana
8665743 el trabajo que hice para esas compa as era muy espec fico es como le dije fue como lobista tambi n
8665744 el presidente del pa s vino al consejo de directores y le pidi ayuda en el otorgamiento de financiamiento al ministerio de obras p blicas y a partir de ah el dinero fue aprobado por el consejo de directores
8665745 no es usual en rep blica dominicana usar cartas de compromiso cuando se hace el trabajo de lobista
8665746 yo nunca tapo nada ni tengo por qu tapar nada
8665747 a california copyright infringement case brought by an adult video maker against a video sharing web site veoh networks has been
8665748 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8665749 youtube has gone above and beyond the law to protect content owners while empowering people to communicate and share their experiences online
8665750 even if the veoh decision were to be considered by other courts that case does nothing to change the fact that youtube is a business built on infringement that has failed to take reasonable measures to respect the rights of creators and content owners

8665752 whats noteworthy about paramounts summer is how few of its films were purely homegrown

8665754 he has become a public embaressment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8665755 i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is his need to throw a tantrum for the whole world to hear is the reason

8665758 we sent each of them a letter inviting them to a nice dinner at our church on friday night before they see the movie we will also provide free childcare at the church it was a thank you for all you do letter no strings attached just a gift we want to let the movie do the teaching everyone who is married will relate to this movie because many of the issues are so real and weve all dealt with some of them this movie has it all
8665759 we pray that the movie will plant some seeds and cause people to ask what is the solution to my problem
8665760 we hope that people struggling in their marriages will come to church to seek answers to the problems theyre having
8665761 if someone rides up to a convenience store with a sawed off shotgun and a prior record im not intimidating anybody by calling the cops if this republican campaign is going to be run in mccarthyite fashion by lawbreakers in an illegal way they are going to pay a price

8665792 was one of the two most costly failures of engineered systems in history rivalled only the chernobyl meltdown
8665793 san francisco is a happy gay man portland is a angry lesbian
8665794 but if this is what it takes this is what it takes cause its wrong and people are dying
8665795 the recall has been very large but in fact its entirely possible that only a small portion of the meat that was recalled was actually contaminated
8665796 im quite concerned because i am a walking time bomb
8665797 as a first time homebuyer i was nervous about the entire process step by step joe made it easy and fun his expertise in the columbus real estate market is a tremendous asset he is highly recommended
8665798 the unprecedented rise in energy prices we have seen in recent months is a call to action for utilities to find ways to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption
8665799 by creating these utility incentives the commission is providing a valuable incentive for utilities to find ways to improve energy efficiency which is the most cost effective and most immediate way to reduce the burden of rising energy and environmental costs on residential and business customers
8665800 if our nation is truly serious about regulating greenhouse gases the clean air act is the wrong tool for the job it is really at the feet of congress
8665801 there are good biofuels and bad biofuels out there we want to distinguish the good from the bad
8665802 this wind farm project will strengthen the position of the cez group in romania itself and enlarges our activities in the electricity generation sector there
8665803 cwp has been very excited about the potential of the romanian market since it began development here more than two years ago and we are very pleased to have found a partner in cez which shares our enthusiasm and excitement about this extraordinary project and this extraordinary country
8665804 the seed awards again underline that creative and entrepreneurial solutions to many of the pressing challenges facing the world are being found
8665805 it is now vital that these shining examples are federated and mainstreamed across communities and countries to maximize their undoubted and potentially significant impact
8665806 if we see that again in 2008 i think that would a really strong indication that a difference really has been made among this 20 to 24 year old age group
8665807 ive no idea whats going on its very hard to get communication with some people in life
8665808 what can i say i think the best thing is to wait to 1 september
8665809 shes using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay lets just say i hope lindsay starts opening her eyes and realizes who the people using her are
8665810 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8665811 if you guessed it had to do with my father then you guessed right
8665812 because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again
8665813 i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction i was angry when i first read his attack on me but for me i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8665814 one of the projects were working on is how to raise awareness in those suburbs
8665815 we want to look at how well its known and whether people take any notice of it
8665816 they get so upset when theyre downgraded and put in a lot of effort to get back up
8665817 the number one thing is making sure staff are aware of it all the time
8665818 im so delighted to see the back of patsy and kevins appointment is a bit left field but it is interesting so we look forward to discussion with the board about the rationale for this
8665819 send e mail with the assumption that the person you really dont want to read it will read it
8665820 i was hoping to have a last round of radiation to shrink the tumour in my brain but i cant have it now doctors say they cant treat the same area they did last time
8665821 i know ive fought it off for so long but seeing the size of the tumour now seeing how fast it has grown has shaken me
8665822 i really believe if you think positively your body can overcome anything
8665823 but this this is huge it feels like too much this time
8665824 i dont feel like i deserve it but i am so so grateful for it
8665825 i had a gentleman pay my skytv completely and other people have just slipped envelopes under my door with cash in them
8665826 such bad news about the radiation and learning that my immune system would never survive chemotherapy has brought all this much closer and made it more real than ever before
8665827 but ive been just blown away by how wonderful people have been to me and i want them to know that they radically change my life
8665828 the cash is amazing and essential but its the generosity and support behind that it moves me to tears
8665829 this is the story of a john mccain home you might not know about
8665830 this is where john mccain was starved beaten tortured and maimed for life so the next time barack obama talks about one of john mccains homes remember this one
8665831 whenever anyone brings up any legitimate policy or personal issue in the campaign that might be relevant to the 40 years of his life after john mccain was released from prison you remind them he was a prisoner of war once
8665832 to rise to the challenge and see the benefits of taking some risks to feel alive to realise that through acts of courage facing fear insight can flourish there are uncounted millions of people who now go through life without any sort of real vibrant kick the answer is surfing
8665833 you have to dream you have to have a vision then you have to set a goal for yourself that might even scare you a little because sometimes that seems far beyond your reach then i think you have to develop a kind of resistance to rejections and to the disappointments that are sure to come your way
8665834 incluso puso en duda que eta tuviera como objetivo las obras de esta infraestructura
8665835 we anticipate this acquisition to be immediately accretive to earnings
8665836 our initial take on this announcement is that independent bank took advantage of the opportunity to solidify its balance sheet by boosting its total capital ratio without materially diluting shareholders
8665837 while we do not see an immediate need for capital being driven by deteriorating credit this move may have been a proactive response to the uncertainty surrounding its exposure to trust preferred securities
8665838 were not going to let our food costs rise faster than our food budgets so if we can buy in bulk we can save in a per eating effect
8665839 im happy given that our operating earnings in the key divisions automotive equipment footwear and packaging are relatively strong year on year
8665840 weve cleared the decks in terms of the portfolio and we now have four clear divisions we are happy to remain in
8665841 were playing with a lot of discipline and patience and have the game to take on the stags theyre a very quick team through their halves and have some big boys in their forward pack
8665842 they operate well around the rucks they are strong in that department and it is an area we are going to have to watch
8665843 weve languished in the third division for too long so this match is very important for us
8665844 it may be a function of social perceptions of alcohol in that particular region
8665845 it has had a very negative impact on our day to day life
8665846 weve been scoring plenty of goals but weve also been leaking a lot of goals
8665847 the tight defence we had at the beginning of the season has been missing in recent weeks
8665848 i believe were up to it the team has shown a lot of bottle they keep coming back
8665849 we came back from 3 1 down to draw 3 3 with mt albert ponsonby and we were 2 1 down against tauranga city and came back to square the match
8665850 we were 4 2 down against lynn avon last saturday and drew level at 4 4 before they scored the decider in the 89th minute
8665851 were going out to win it we dont want to start thinking tactics and playing for a draw its going to be too dangerous to sit back
8665852 for those having a hard time scraping together ground rent to put an extra couple of thousand into a lawyer is unbelievably hard
8665853 everything is at a bit of a standstill we cant move we cant sell we cant do anything its not a happy place here
8665854 my instinct was to try and grab hold of the door
8665855 how he didnt take out oncoming traffic i dont know
8665856 we are finding our businesses are banding together well with shared information this kind of collaborative work with the business association and police is getting solid information
8665857 i dont think a player should be able to play for two clubs in the same competition in the same season and i think we need to get the uefa strategic committee to look at the whole idea
8665858 i think that it is wrong that a player can play for two clubs in any competition scoring a goal for one team one week and then scoring against them a few weeks later
8665859 i also think we have to look at both the summer and winter transfer windows the season starts in many countries in july or early in august yet the transfer window does not close till the end of august
8665860 then we have another window in the middle of the season i think we need to look at the way the system works
8665861 we cannot force a young player to sign for his first club after that age
8665862 but at least if they signed a first contract at 13 or 14 then they would have a period of stability in their careers while they are being developed as young players
8665863 we already know he is a rock star we already know he can bring 85 000 people together in a stadium he has done it multiple times he needs to talk to people who havent made up their minds yet
8665864 it is going to be very elegant and firmly rooted in the traditional operatic style but rather than using costumes from the period we have costumes that echo the silhouette of the period with more of a haute couture look there will be lots of reflective surfaces and i cant tell you how many chandeliers
8665865 to glorify god through the development of software for children teenagers and families that spreads the gospel of jesus christ while entertaining enlightening and encouraging faith
8665866 normal habit of attending to the way things are may become attenuated or lost
8665867 excessive indulgence in bullshitting which involves making assertions without paying attention to anything except what it suits one to say
8665868 never claimed that the group in any way thanked people who attacked mike pressler or who demanded his dismissal
8665869 rolls into the classroom on the first day of class
8665870 its ok to be one sided in speaking solely to campus critics of the lacrosse team
8665871 seeking interview subjects who would declare their opinion in absolutes
8665872 appeared in an nbc piece about the success of the womens team and the difficulty they had watching their male counterparts go through this ordeal
8665873 aspects of the teams conduct that extend into the social realms of character and integrity and should not be the parameters of adjudicatory processes
8665874 white innocence means black guilt mens innocence means womens guilt
8665875 demand ing that duke divest from companies doing business in israel
8665876 perfect offenders perfect victim the limitations of spectacularity in the aftermath of the lacrosse team incident
8665877 see the alleged offenders as the exemplars of the upper end of the class hierarchy the politically dominant race and ethnicity the dominant gender the dominant sexuality and the dominant social group on campus
8665878 if our students did what is alleged it is appalling to the worst degree if they didnt do it whatever they did is bad enough
8665879 i might get in trouble if i say it but you know what a mean
8665880 the underage drinking was bad enough to merit the national assault on his two students character
8665881 brodhead revealed his callous indifference to the truth suggesting that even if the alleged rape had never occurred the lacrosse players were getting what they deserved
8665882 this figure that comes into intellectual spaces like a thug who literally is fearful and menacing
8665883 cited comments written by students on blogs including one students comment that duke was leaning towards a culture of crassness which adversely affected the intellectual atmosphere of the university
8665884 intrigued at how quickly a term i created in my little apartment in durham spread like a virus and made it into a national news magazine newsweek within two weeks
8665885 imagine why anyone associated with duke would have chosen to erase the three names but brodheads durham is not gottwalds prague in a society where information is free i am confident that righteous forces will prevail
8665886 the 2003 2004 roster lists one lacrosse player the 2004 2005 roster lists 24 players the 2005 2006 roster lists 34 players shouldnt you investigate why all the rosters are grossly incomplete before assuming that there is an attempt to forget history
8665887 comments are moderated but with the lightest of touches to exclude only off topic comments or obviously racist or similar remarks
8665888 50 percent of diws posts were about the duke professoriate
8665889 assuming that this group apologist i e me referenced the faculty with his incorrect claim
8665890 w ith regard to the group of 88 taylor and johnson are engaging in demagoguery certainly there are some left wing crackpots at duke and no doubt some right wing crackpots
8665891 s ome people might consider calling members of the faculty crackpots to be insidiously polarizing irrational and anti academic

8665910 were not going to let our food costs rise faster than our food budgets so if we can buy in bulk we can save in a per eating effect
8665911 overall these trends last a long period of time because consumers adjust their buying habits and they change their routine
8665912 i wanted to be able to buy in bulk when things were on sale or at a pretty good price and have the room to save and freeze and store anything that we can get a good price
8665913 freezers tend to be countercyclical meaning that they generally do better when the economy is soft because people go out less and buy groceries in bulk
8665914 the meteorological pattern calls for a lingering pattern of precipitation in the western corn belt during the next six to 10 days
8665915 corn futures traders are likely to be looking ahead to a less disturbing outlook for corn production
8665916 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person who is the ideal beauty of the moment but even kate moss doesnt live up to the image
8665917 this is a very complex area with very difficult veterinary and legal issues to be looked at
8665918 i have asked this expert group to propose measures that will ensure prohibited substances have no part to play in equestrian sport
8665919 as an industry we must adopt a zero tolerance approach
8665920 it is important that we address all eventualities not just the most recent case
8665921 unfortunately we have had a number of high profile cases involving horses testing positive and we need to look at the lessons from all of these
8665922 everybody involved with horse sport ireland is asking themselves what more we could have done to prevent this catastrophe
8665923 the secret to sobering up is time no amount of coffee energy drinks cold showers or even a full irish will speed up the process
8665924 you might feel better but it doesnt mean you are fit to drive
8665925 the traffic is something we have no control over but we have spent a lot of time with the gardai and civil defence to ensure the traffic tomorrow runs perfectly

8665931 confidence in the bridge safety inspection process has been shaken
8665932 its not something the cardinals would do i dont think
8665933 according to a new survey 34 percent of americans are at increased risk for insomnia
8665934 nearly 60 percent of those at increased risk for insomnia say that their symptoms affect their daily activities at least a few days a week
8665935 many people at increased risk for insomnia say trouble falling asleep or staying asleep impacts their job performance mood family relationships and or attention and concentration
8665936 only about half of those at increased risk for insomnia have actually initiated a conversation with their healthcare professional about their sleep issues
8665937 many people at increased risk for insomnia are hesitant to talk to their healthcare professional about their sleep problems because they either dont think they have insomnia or a sleep problem 40 percent or its not serious enough to make an appointment 66 percent or they are concerned about the safety of prescription sleep aids 48 percent
8665938 while most respondents can identify the consequences of insomnia such as increased risk of car crashes decreased work performance depression or mood changes they dont have a clear understanding of what insomnia is
8665939 30 million americans are affected by chronic insomnia each year
8665940 in my mind thats now one hell of a motto for a better education system
8665941 in 1989 when the tolomeo table task was given the compasso doro award for italian industrial design it was credited with having achieved the perfect marriage between design and engineering that works together in total
8665942 large scale exports of fresh water would be a wealth creating idea for quebec and for canada as a whole
8665943 the development and marketing of this expertise requires a strategic plan to enable quebec to become a leader in water management
8665944 at a time when water is becoming scarce in many parts of the world its economic development stirs up substantial opposition however though some people fear harmful exploitation or even the drying up of our water resources it is urgent to look seriously at developing our blue gold
8665945 were concerned about that we know theres pressure from the u s to export canadas water but we see water as a human right and a public resource
8665946 we dont want to see water commodified and commercialized in this manner
8665947 they see it as an economic opportunity and clearly the motivation here is profit
8665948 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted

8665954 cest un probl me que les r gulateurs nationaux recommandent la commission de r gler
8665955 cest tr s difficile de faire quelque chose au niveau national car le roaming implique des op rateurs dans au moins deux pays diff rents
8665956 ce nest que logique de payer seulement pour ce quon consomme
8665957 quand la r gulation sur leurotarif est entr e en vigueur il y a pas mal dop rateurs qui sont retourn s la pratique de facturer des minutes enti res et pas le montant exact quun consommateur consomme
8665958 cest une mani re pour les op rateurs de ne pas jouer le jeu

8666026 great and it will save us gas and appeal to the environmentalists
8666027 im happy with the realisation of state government that there is a problem and they are working with us now
8666028 obviously im not happy with the cartage of water but its got to happen
8666029 im not happy with the amount of time this has taken but im glad were moving forward
8666030 weve missed out on lots of opportunities to fix our water
8666031 its not premier blighs fault and its certainly not mine if you wanted to start pointing fingers youd have to go back a long way but if we want to fix it nows the time
8666032 im very conscious that there is an expectation of immediate answers but what i really want to do is secure the long term future of cloncurry
8666033 im very confident but we have to go step by step
8666034 were very aware that we need to be looking not only at the immediate concerns but at the long term
8666035 we are well aware of the seriousness of the situation and have stated on a number of occasions that we are not going to see this community without water
8666036 the government is very aware of the work that has been undertaken to this point and we are confident that by working with the council and industry we can secure cloncurrys water supply for years to come
8666037 when i first started looking houses were a lot cheaper than they are now but i didnt have a deposit and when i could finally get in houses were much more expensive and i realised i couldnt do it alone
8666038 doing it this way made it easy for us both to break in to the market
8666039 im originally from adelaide and andrew is from sydney and were both being posted elsewhere at the end of next year so well just rent the house out while we are away
8666040 this house is going to be a long term investment for us and well try to hold on to it for the next 10 years or so
8666041 the scheme offers home owners varied levels of mortgage assistance depending on how long we have been with the army
8666042 by having this as an extra incentive we will save a couple of hundred dollars a month on mortgage repayments
8666043 what we are seeing is a number of generation y that have spent all their lives at home with their parents not just after school but longer term and have got married or are starting a family and are growing out of their parental home
8666044 because they dont have their deposits the parents are jumping in to help and were seeing a lot of that at the moment
8666045 theres a lot of people out there that dont have the income to support a 400 000 loan so theyre going in with family or friends
8666046 i think its great to see people exploring different ways of cracking the market and going ahead with these purchases
8666047 were noticing that a lot of under 30s are breaking into the market buying with their parents
8666048 theres definitely a trend going on and i havent seen this happening for quite some years
8666049 this is something we did in my day and it seems like history is repeating itself
8666050 by having the parents buy in with the kids it means the young ones can still get the first homebuyers grant and no stamp duty on homes that cost 500 000 or less as well as getting a foot in the door
8666051 they dont have to be permanent arrangements but its a great way to get into the market and maybe then do the buy back off the parents share later
8666052 the good thing is that the federal government will be taking up one of the hias ideas to start a first home saver account that will offer tax incentives to young people saving for their future homes that will be a huge benefit to a lot of people
8666053 thats why patients are in the goddamn corridor and i find it disgusting
8666054 by 2011 i dont see how we can cope those beds needed to come on line next year
8666055 at 4pm its 18 waiting but theyre 18 different people
8666056 it wasnt a ban on doctors talking to the media
8666057 im more than happy for senior doctors and nurses to talk to the media
8666058 i think its very important north queenslanders are able to hear whats happening at their hospital from the senior staff here
8666059 with the population growing the hospital infrastructure has been lagging behind
8666060 i think the sick people of north queensland and the whole community deserve an excellent health service
8666061 if we have to wait to 2011 for more beds the current situation with many people waiting for beds in the emergency department will occur much more regularly
8666062 the consequences are the very hard working staff who are already frustrated and worn out will find that they are unable to care adequately for the sick people
8666063 were very lucky to have an excellent group of doctors nurses and other clinical staff working here
8666064 they are under extreme pressure at the moment to cope with working in an overloaded hospital
8666065 theyve been coping with this for quite some time and theyre getting worn out
8666066 in the last few years quite a number of good medical staff have left
8666067 its not just a matter of clearing out a desk and wheeling in a bed
8666068 things have to be put in like oxygen tubing electronic monitoring nurses stations
8666069 elective surgery is the only thing we have any control over
8666070 we need something radical like putting elective cancer surgery on hold
8666071 i think its awful if people travel long distances for surgery
8666072 a ban on elective surgery would be a band aid short term solution and would make little difference
8666073 i think in many ways this hospital should be funded above levels of capital city hospitals because its being asked to look after people from an enormous region at a special level of quality and excellence
8666074 we certainly know from the published literature that where admission is indicated for a patient they are far better off in an appropriate ward setting rather than trying to struggle on in an emergency setting
8666075 emergency departments do not have the staff to support patients lying around on trolleys it is very unsatisfactory to have any such arrangement
8666076 if someone is having a chest pain these trolleys do not have all the monitors like a bed
8666077 we were introduced to jeffrey spokes work by broken trinity writer ron marz and i was immediately taken by his incredible sense of design and artistry
8666078 were incredibly proud to offer jeffreys three covers for broken trinity as the unbroken beautifully iconic piece he originally envisioned
8666079 with blue light the box jellyfish exhibited what we interpret as feeding behaviour
8666080 the animals pulsated slowly and rhythmically and streamed their tentacles out very long approaching the light more slowly and made repeated passes figure eight style through the illuminated area
8666081 the tentacles are doing this long figure eight thing just fishing through the light its just unbelievable to watch
8666082 theyre probably responding to something to do with low light in a dim environment maybe dawn and dusk maybe murky environments but it clearly has something to do with this blue light
8666083 so many of the foreshores up and down the coast use blue light streaming out onto the stinger nets or lighting the foreshore or the boardwalk
8666084 what this means is that it is not only attracting the jellyfish its actually making them behave in such a way that they are potentially more lethal because theyve got more tentacle exposed and they do more damage
8666085 for tourism operators and councils and regular swimmers or boaties i think theres every legitimate reason the irukandji may respond to blue light in same way
8666086 when you start pointing to the dugout and saying all the things that he was saying a guy that respects the game like i myself i didnt appreciate it and i had to let him know
8666087 in some cases operators are charging you for a call of one minute two seconds what they can charge you for two minutes this leads to overcharging on average of 24 percent for calls made and 19 percent for calls received
8666088 the regulation of billing increments within the eurotariff or any other roaming tariff would amount to micro management and would risk further erosion of competitive differentiation in the market
8666089 billing increments are a point of differentiation that operators can use to appeal to customers with different preferences
8666090 this is an issue national regulators have recommended the european commission to address if you tackle this issue you have to tackle it in eu legislation this is something the european commission will consider in the weeks to come
8666091 there is an interesting and worrying phenomenon that the commission and national regulators have identified
8666092 in some cases operators are charging you for a call of one minute two seconds what they can charge you for two minutes this is a result of not charging by the second
8666093 a lot of operators resorted to billing whole minutes and not the exact amount of time the consumer uses
8666094 most operators did not change their billing system since the introduction of the roaming regulations
8666095 a difference that operators can use to attract consumers with different preferences

8666118 it also provides the college with national and international exposure and an opportunity to establish relationships with industry leaders
8666119 i think the unique aspect of hall of honor is that it brings a number of the top leaders from the various sectors of the industry together in one place to have a dialogue with our students
8666120 the other exciting thing is that our students are running the event

8666142 energy bars are familiar to many americans but other energized foods such as candy chips milk and cereal are definitely not we expect the concept of energy both physical and mental to greatly influence food product development
8666143 energy is poised to take food in a new direction giving consumers who need a boost many different ways to get it
8666144 from natural energizers like omega 3s or antioxidants to foods that are fortified with energizing ingredients we are seeing energy to emerge as a core benefit in new food products
8666145 this trend shows that consumers may be distinguishing between somewhat unhealthy stimulants which they desire and high sugar content in drinks which they do not
8666146 stimulants could be infused into many other foods breakfast foods may be a particularly good candidate including energy giving cereals breads and spreads
8666147 energy drinks have quickly become a daily beverage choice as more americans use energy drinks weve seen a rise in products being launched with innovative new ingredients claims and consumer targets
8666148 in the carbonated product the carbonation itself is an active ingredient because it helps keep the fish oils fresh by fighting oxidsation

8666162 if the prime minister was truly concerned with protecting arctic sovereignty his top priority would be addressing the climate crisis and stopping the rapid loss of ice at the poles
8666163 but instead mr harper is allowing emissions to rise and plans to let big oil and gas companies drill in the melting north the arctic is our common heritage and drilling for oil in this fragile environment is unacceptable
8666164 the harper government must wake up and recognize that canadas territories will need millions in funding for adaptation programs as climate related threats to northern infrastructure as the climate crisis worsens we can expect melting winter roads collapsing land due to melting permafrost and host of other problems ignoring the climate crisis will not make it go away but we can help mitigate the effects by having adaptation plans in place
8666165 eliminating the position of ambassador for the circumpolar north cutting climate program funding relaxing regulations on dumping of ship waste in the arctic and canceling the procurement of coast guard vessels and planes for search and rescue do not advance the goal of arctic sovereignty

8666179 corresponde a las fuerzas armadas a la polic a nacional al cuerpo de bomberos a la defensa civil y a la cruz roja dominicana hacer las evacuaciones una vez el coe emita las alertas
8666180 seg n los reportes se han evacuado alrededor de 8 mil personas lamentablemente tenemos un pa s con 9 millones de personas por lo que no podemos apostar un soldado o un brigadista para cada dominicano se hacen las evacuaciones pero ning n pa s est exento a desastres
8666181 vamos a mantener un monitoreo constante de este evento y de ser necesario emitiremos las alertas correspondientes y las evacuaciones que emana el manual de procedimiento del coe

8666189 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
8666190 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
8666191 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
8666192 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
8666193 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
8666194 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
8666195 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
8666196 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
8666197 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
8666198 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
8666199 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
8666200 starts out as an absolutely charming discussion of how to appreciate classical music but its really about effective evangelization and how we treat people the closing anecdote is killer

8666203 i think we dont intend to curtail peoples freedom and right to give information and debate
8666204 but when you publish content that is libellous defamatory and slanderous to other people i think it is only natural we take action
8666205 so many warnings and opportunities have been given and it is not heeded so i am sure they have exercised their authority well under the law
8666206 i will fight the government action all the way their action will not stop me from writing
8666207 often compelled to ignore or to play down the many events organised by the opposition
8666208 i did about have a heart attack when i found out i was dead
8666209 what it does is it really allows the sellers and the prospective buyers more time to try to work toward purchase of the blethen maine newspapers
8666210 its not from a lack of hard work and cooperation on all fronts management unions owners
8666211 its just we set some time frames that i would take the blame for unrealistic in terms of us being able to process lots of information and make the best decision for my investors
8666212 i still see us as the lead contenders to make an offer
8666213 i cant say were the lead contenders to buy it but were the lead contenders to make a viable offer i still see us as being in a great position
8666214 the situation is this fluid we might make a final offer prior to deadlines we had set
8666215 its possible we may do something before we would have had to do it
8666216 we like the people weve met we like the union leadership
8666217 our understanding is theyre looking for changes in the contract and i think its been pretty clear that weve said were ready to talk about that
8666218 its a setback we understood that this is a very volatile time in the newspaper industry and that this thing would not go perfectly smoothly
8666219 the blethen family still feels that the local ownership group this group would be the preferred option for the community readers and employees
8666220 unfortunately we have to state that attempts are being made to secure certain interests using force not the principles of strict observance of international law and denial of confrontational bloc thinking
8666221 a fine example of such irresponsible criminal actions is georgias aggression against south ossetia it is well known who connived with the georgian authorities and even incited them pursuing their own profit such behavior is unacceptable and should be stopped in such an extreme situation we remained reserved and continued our responsible and predictable policy
8666222 a third of all cases of cerebral palsy are associated with preterm birth
8666223 this study shows a significant reduction in cerebral palsy among preterm infants whose mothers were given magnesium sulfate
8666224 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to date that looked at using this inexpensive and commonly used treatment to reduce the occurrence of cerebral palsy after preterm birth
8666225 cerebral palsy cant always be prevented but the data from our study and its predecessors will help obstetricians make informed treatment decisions for the women under their care
8666226 our results show that obstetricians can use magnesium sulfate which they have experience prescribing to reduce the risk of a devastating condition cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8666227 since tests havent begun yet we dont know what the ailment is

8666232 in these uncertain times when big media is lining the pockets of corporate executives while pushing veteran journalists out the door its more important than ever to form alliances with workers who are facing the same struggle in their industries
8666233 i am very happy that our brothers and sisters at the guild have joined our local
8666234 we always have more strength in numbers and this helps both units become stronger and have a louder voice as one our local strives to organize many people from a varied background every day and this merger is good for all of us in cwa
8666235 i see the merger of tng cwa local 33229 and cwa local 3372 as another positive step in the rejuvenation of our lexington guild local the result will be a stronger and more effective local drawing new power from the resources and experience of cwa and the proud guild history in lexington
8666236 the merger of local 33229 with local 3372 is a great example of both locals doing what is best for their members by creating a stronger more diverse group it also represents another step in integrating the newspaper guild and cwa
8666237 this helps a lot just the confidence the guild has given us in this vote means a lot
8666238 its 25 a week thats five bucks a day i think thats an appropriate sacrifice
8666239 this is a week to really showcase what we do best
8666240 like playing halo while getting a blow job from hello kitty
8666241 within our culture theres a correlation between the word planet and important i dont understand that
8666242 to me the coolest thing in the solar system is the kuiper belt
8666243 its like theres an implicit hierarchy if you are a planet you are first class a list you get inside the rope to the club and otherwise youre nothing
8666244 as we were leaving he looked at us very sadly and said
8666245 some people like to demote heroes and my dad was a hero
8666246 suddenly people were saying lets take the name off of the school that is named for him and lets take the street names off of the streets that are named for him
8666247 we live on a planet and therefore people identify much more closely with planets than they identify with a black hole or a star or whatever
8666248 knowing where the planets were affected your life if you believed that stuff people for historical reasons have assigned an unrealistic importance to those objects and not to objects that are not planets
8666249 not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8666250 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8666251 hes going to be talking to millions of americans individually tonight about the pain that they feel in their lives and what we can do to bring jobs back to this country and create a better life
8666252 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8666253 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8666254 i rely on him and i have for many years
8666255 weve made progress with democrats and it makes sense because people have seen a party this week thats unified
8666256 tutti hanno il diritto di godere delle bellezze della natura
8666257 the battle of iraq is one victory in a war on terror that began on sept 11 2001 and still goes on
8666258 a symbol for his reckless handling of the iraq war
8666259 america has lost more than 3 900 troops and is now spending 3 billion a week on the war
8666260 this is not mission accomplished this is a mission gone awry
8666261 these people are iraq war veterans this is what the occupation of iraq looks like this is what your tax dollars are paying for end the war now bring our troops home now
8666262 writing y l e n o l as i roll past you in this taxicab if you care at all that means im lonely

8666264 thank you thank you but weve gotta get on with this thing
8666265 ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world the former president even praised obamas selection of joe biden as his running mate putting an end to any speculation that he or hillary were bitter about that
8666266 the companys suggestion that the union seeks to drive off all other buyers in order to swoop in to purchase the paper at a rock bottom price lacks any basis in fact and is frankly offensive
8666267 the unions sole concern is to ensure that should the paper be sold the company honor its obligations
8666268 it was such a good and succinct description of how copy editors see their work that i thought it was worth sharing with readers
8666269 its a mystery to me why u s publishers think people will pay more for less especially when the online world offers so many alternatives
8666270 its no accident that u s readership of the economist the guardian and the times has gone up as their american competitors have cut back staff pages and ambition
8666271 we were still unsure where the web would take us fearing loss of subscribers many newspapers resisted putting their content online those that embraced it as an alternate source to get their news out didnt have the luxury of knowing how many additional opportunities that technology would create
8666272 many times an innovative concept is shut down by readers who simply are not used to it and therefore dismiss it as foreign to them
8666273 i definitely find that editors outside of the u s are more likely to let gut feeling their nose their eyes or just a sense of street savvy help them make decisions when it comes to introducing new concepts
8666274 sponsorship ads for the weather or tv listings is seen as intruding into the landscape of the editorial integrity of the paper
8666275 the years of effective local monopoly seem to have sucked out of american papers most of their aggressiveness of imagination when it comes to selling themselves to either readers or advertisers kennedy said
8666276 but publishers are reluctant to give up 20 to 25 percent of their revenue
8666277 at the sound of the tone the time will be 12am this is the sound of the midnight rockers express late night radio vibes from new york city for any time of the day for anywhere you are bringing you inspiring and entertaining music with no boundaries playing the brand new releases and the classic recordings featuring special edits remixes and dj mega mixes from the mre crew
8666278 we are doing this because of the economic downturn in our industry
8666279 the beacon journal is no exception we believe these packages are a generous alternative to layoffs
8666280 we very much respect each individuals decision about whether it works best for them at this point
8666281 highly unlikely that another buyout program will be offered again in the future
8666282 just about every business and every household has to make some tough decisions but we want to do that as thoughtfully as possible and thats what were doing
8666283 by offering a voluntary buyout thats part of our plan to keep the paper economically viable
8666284 default is a real possibility and the capacity to meet financial commitments is vulnerable to deterioration in business and economic conditions
8666285 all right sir you can choose between helga the horse weighing in at a beefy 450lbs or svelte svetlana coming in at 120lbs
8666286 svetlana is going to be cheaper because shes like a quarter of helga right
8666287 all right sir you can choose between helga the horse weighing in at a beefy 450lbs or svelte svetlana coming in at 120lbs
8666288 svetlana is going to be cheaper because shes like a quarter of helga right
8666289 the question as it applies to libraries is this should more libraries be circulating video games in an effort to extend the value of a video game isnt that what libraries are all about dont we buy books movies music and other media so that more people may use them as often as they wish wont our dollar go a lot further if libraries buy a game and have it played so much that it wont play anymore

8666292 the tournament was good very well organized and we were treated very well
8666293 we lost our best player plus another defender and two experienced forwards
8666294 kuwait and the uae were allowed to have six european players on their teams
8666295 both countries had strong european goalies the kuwaitis first line was all czech while the uae had belarusians
8666296 we lost all our games but we feel like winners the positives far outweigh the negatives and i think theres a promising future for algerian ice hockey
8666297 the main thing is we got noticed and now the government and private companies want to invest i think with more preparation and money we can beat the arab teams with or without foreigners
8666298 attempts to keep the most hotly anticipated consumer electronics devices under wraps these days are getting more and more futile its hard enough for companies to control disgruntled employees and leaks in the international supply chain stir in a giant government organization and things quickly unravel case in point htc dream widely believed to be the worlds first android handset after engadget loosed the dream from its fcc constraints on the 18th of august htc contacted the agency on the 19th with a request to use a less detailed diagram for the fcc label placement fortunately for us they complied giving us what can only be construed as official measurements in the process the newly unveiled 115 x 55 mm dimensions tell us that it beats the iphone 3g in terms of length and width but is almost certainly thicker than the iphone due to the dreams sliding qwerty
8666299 the other thing i would say about our brands is that they have faced world wars they have faced revolutions they have faced more economic cycles than we will see and they are today faster more profitable and appealing to more customers than ever before
8666300 inevitably the companys outlook for 2009 is rather less bullish and the ongoing rise in commodity costs could yet erode some of its
8666301 nonetheless the company is well positioned to withstand slowing economic growth

8666315 an illustrators perspective can add a whole new world of references for a brand that is very individual
8666316 for example take fran ois berthoud or kareem iliya who illustrate fashion but through a very personal filter i love to think that the illustrators interpretation of the designers fashion brings new inspiration to the designer so that they feed off each other
8666317 getting to work at the sun was a really big deal
8666318 it wasnt easy getting that job its what i really wanted to do
8666319 we cant just have people walking around here and looking around
8666320 if you cut back the newsroom drastically this is going to be a very different city
8666321 america is becoming increasingly beset with complex problems and our distant corporate owners are turning us into a tabloid full of press releases and miley cyrus photos
8666322 were desperate for paid subscribers but were trying to bring them in by offering them less its not going to work its wrong and i want no part of it
8666323 against the walls were set up these life sized figures of baltimore celebrities michael phelps william donald schaefer cal ripken jr john waters all the usual suspects they put it there to impress sam sam comes in there like you know born to be wild thats the song they played
8666324 a lot of people had hope that this guy was going to come in you know talk about himself being a maverick reinventing the newspaper because all of us know that something needs to be done
8666325 were all interested in trying new things but his plans turned out to be slash and burn
8666326 there was some hope when zell came in because the previous management was so bad
8666327 what he was saying immediately after he took over in december was encouraging he said were going to involve our employees in our decisions and were going to be open about our finances
8666328 this is the first time weve had two staff reductions in three months
8666329 i dont know whether this is the biggest cut ever but its the biggest one percentage wise
8666330 we rightsized last june we rightsized again in march each time it was the wrong size
8666331 had 45 days to decide some are staying on the staff to the end of the year theres time to deal with it at tribune its always a kind of panic
8666332 the planning is backward youd think youd do a plan and figure out how many people you need to execute it but what were doing is deciding how many people we can afford given our revenue projections and then making the plan
8666333 we had no idea what was going to happen then suddenly we had to deal with it on a daily basis
8666334 i wish him luck ive got to admire him for that
8666335 to me those e mails seem kind of fey new age y
8666336 and in terms of what were doing now its not new at all for 10 years weve been trying redesigns weve been trying more pictures and more graphics and circulation keeps declining and advertising keeps declining and now zell is trying a lot more of it in a much shorter period id be surprised if it works
8666337 at the beginning they were asking people for their ideas and everything
8666338 i was on the original team that advised while setting up the web site in 1997 then the corporate types came down and drew this wall and no one could talk about it they cut it off completely from the newsroom
8666339 it is so beyond me the idea that it is so much more important to keep the union at bay
8666340 thats the attitude that upper management took former sun owner times mirror and later the tribune co even more its the kind of thing where you bite off your nose to spite your face
8666341 its the heart of the sun readership in many ways and the countys got what 780 000 people and baltimores got 630 000 if they can convince enough people to boost the census numbers
8666342 with all the money that they spent advertising b they couldnt give us any assurances that it would help the sun
8666343 were like were all for innovation but the reason youre able to market b is youre using the sun so are you going to spend money with this to reinvigorate the sun they wouldnt tell us eventually we could be cannibalizing ourselves
8666344 we were at every school board meeting and every zoning board meeting
8666345 june arney who left the paper this year was covering real estate as a part of the business section
8666346 she picked up reports about it thats not something that you think up at a meeting of editors
8666347 there was the case of this vietnamese woman in pigtown
8666348 she was driving by this house that she thought she owned and it had been rented out to this guy and theres an auction going on and theyre selling the damn house her son called the paper and the business section did a story on it everyone said its a weird thing and this never happens
8666349 thousands of these cases had been filed for something that never happens
8666350 the way this thing had developed you could owe 48 in ground rent and they could take your house
8666351 i mean the newspaper is still a place where when youre at your wits end and you dont know what to do you call a newspaper
8666352 when you have a newsroom full of reporters every day who are having 20 30 conversations with members of the community thats a lot of sharing of information sharing of ideas issues problems when you start sending people away when you start cleaning out desks shutting off those computers unplugging the phones you cut off that dialogue you mute it
8666353 i get all these calls from people who are saying like i cant call you anymore who do i call and as the newsroom continues to whittle down were shutting off those connections how many sources have we lost its scary
8666354 he came in on this total photo op jogging tour i was circling around him telling him i was from university of delaware
8666355 he shook my hand and pulled me into the circle and was like ask me some questions i dont even remember what i asked but he just talked about joe biden and delaware as if it really mattered that was when i was sold on the business
8666356 i got this tip that there was a council hearing and the question was why comcast cable wasnt employing more minority subcontractors the tip said one of those minority subcontractors was a company that employed dixons sister
8666357 her response was who told you that who told you that
8666358 so i said i cant really tell you that but it kind of confirms that maybe its true
8666359 so i called the companies that were mentioned by her
8666360 it was me laura vozzella and tom pelton eventually laura left the beat it was just me and tom then tom left lynn anderson just left
8666361 well jon fritze is a great reporter if he stays im comfortable that shell be watched
8666362 i left magazines to come back to newspapers and do the type of journalism that makes more of an impact locally
8666363 and now im being told that that type of journalism isnt what people want when theres big news breaking people pick up the paper because they want to know about serious issues i dont know how you can fill a newspaper with whatever it is sam zell thinks that people want
8666364 tim ryan and tim franklin have drawn a line in the dust
8666365 youve got to get these peoples names before they go
8666366 the number of voluntary departures left us short of the total needed to align payroll costs with our reduced revenues
8666367 four young children were left without food in just absolute filth
8666368 there was trash throughout the apartment there were bugs throughout the apartment and the youngsters had dirty diapers apparently there was a very foul odor in the residence and just horrible conditions
8666369 being selective on your entry points is a great way to get yourself on a winning streak
8666370 we like to provide as many services as possible for free
8666371 he means so much for the club and for the supporters
8666372 his contract is until 10 january and we let his agent know a couple of days ago that we are not thinking of selling him
8666373 our hope is that larsson will continue at helsingborg even next year

8666381 i am happy that fifa and the georgian football federation have made a decision to play the game against georgia in a neutral venue

8666385 its been very frustrating and in hindsight i probably didnt give it enough time but the x rays look good now and the surgeon is happy with how the healing process has gone in recent weeks
8666386 by all accounts war of attrition is well and while i havent sat on him yet im due to go down to mouse morris in the next fortnight or so to start the partnership
8666387 is that the sun coming up on the eastern shore
8666388 other storms may blow and the wind may rise still i long to go where the fast mail flies i know shes gone whatever i say but it wont be long til i make up my mind and go away

8666390 the patrols returned fire and called in close air support against the insurgents
8666391 we like to provide as many services as possible for free
8666392 vi trodde att det inte g r att ta en s dan kaka f r det blir s fruktansv rt beskt men nu visar det sig att ett s llskap nd har gjort det och f tt symptom
8666393 its inappropriate to comment on what is going on behind the scenes at the moment
8666394 were working on it but ive been doing transfers for many many years and know nothing is done until its done either in or out
8666395 well see what happens but unfortunately everybody is going to have to wait
8666396 everyone at milton keynes dons would like to recognise keiths huge contribution to the club both on and off the pitch in the two years he has been in milton keynes
8666397 we wish keith every success in his future career and he will always be welcomed back to stadium mk either as a player of a friend of the club
8666398 i hope you dont have too much indigestion after eating your words
8666399 to come to grips with the fact that he was simply a person with a video camera who happened to record some public events
8666400 but it feels like its much harder for them to make their point now that its how i earn my paycheck
8666401 but i think its understood youre trying to get the facts of the story a reader can easily understand and no story is free of minute details that are also important
8666402 first block of embarcadero six windows were reported broken at 10 59 a
8666403 we didnt see journalist in that description and that made us wonder were we getting behind a guy who was not there to gather news but who was involved in the protests
8666404 i cant speak for josh but there was this thinking going around at the time oh man down with the mainstream media yet it was the mainstream media who was right there to help josh out
8666405 there are very few easy poster children for good causes of journalism
8666406 its less important for people to debate who is a journalist and more important for people to consider is it journalism
8666407 if his only journalistic quality is that he runs around with a camera and films stuff then a whole lot of teenagers can be considered journalists
8666408 the fact is that all journalism is based on solid writing
8666409 and there is no better place to practice the fundamentals of journalism than at a local daily newspaper
8666410 it certainly does not reflect a move toward trying to get a contract
8666411 the folks back home see a washington bureau as a luxury
8666412 they get plenty of copy from the wires to fill up their pages i dont know that theres a real understanding of washington
8666413 ive watched people parachute into washington and they just dont have the same facility
8666414 get embedded in washington just as reporters develop sources at city hall or the school board you go beyond stenography into enterprise
8666415 the coverage obviously suffered after 04 we never went to the white house anymore
8666416 i was crushed i will never look at someone who has lost his job the same way
8666417 if you can get around the jargon we all talk in and make clear why this matters it will be read
8666418 we didnt go to press conferences and cover the story of the day
8666419 but as we got further from 9 11 fewer and fewer papers would run homeland security stories sometimes our copy got lost in the shuffle it was obviously frustrating
8666420 sometimes the local story isnt sitting right here in your zip code or area code
8666421 oftentimes its in washington nobody can afford the kind of washington coverage we all used to do were in a struggle of trying to figure out how to provide the coverage we need and still stay within our economic constraints
8666422 i have to raise tens of millions of dollars because of the junk you feed the people of pennsylvania
8666423 tracking whos getting the money and what favors these people are getting in return not to get on too high a horse but its vital to a healthy democracy thats whats being lost the real scrutiny for members of congress
8666424 if i were given a choice between thoughtful original national journalism practiced at our washington bureau and intensive investigation of louisiana matters i would have to choose the latter
8666425 in the end the value of newspapers having vigorous local coverage trumps the kind of pieces a larger bureau was able to produce
8666426 in the two hour forum at orange countys saddleback church obama told pastor rick warren that it was above my pay grade to define when a baby gets human rights while mccain quickly answered at the moment of conception
8666427 obama offered more nuanced and analytical answers on some issues important to conservative voters abortion same sex marriage and stem cell research but obama a christian who until recently attended trinity united church of christ in chicago was more revealing about his faith
8666428 explaining what it meant to him to be a christian the democrat talked of walking humbly with our god i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends he said
8666429 this is a masterful performance having watched nothing but ads and soundbites and speeches for the past few weeks id forgotten a little bit what a class act he can be i want people to know me well we will get the president we need theres a strange calm to the guy a self distancing that isnt simply aloofness maybe its faith
8666430 i dont mean to sound churlish but the cliches are pretty overwhelming at this point americas best days are ahead etc etc mccains evolution into a candidate who knows how to stroke the christianist base is somewhat impressive it was a little canned at times but it will work with evangelicals all in all this struck me as pretty much a draw but it also struck me that the questions could have been asked in a non religious setting and by a real journalist who might have even followed up the questions and not allowed both candidates but especially mccain to go on anecdote auto pilot
8666431 simple direct big questions brought out something we dont usually see in a presidential face off in this forum as opposed to a read the prompter speech or even a debate focused on the issues of the moment the candidates were forced to call on everything they had the things they have done and learned throughout their lives and the fact is john mccain has lived a much bigger life than barack obama thats not a slam at obama mccain has lived a much bigger life than most people but it still made obama look small in comparison mccain was the clear winner of the night
8666432 murders have risen 18 percent over a year ago assaults in the city involving guns are also rising city officials police supt jody weis and the police force are increasingly coming under criticism but some republicans say part of the blame also lies with obama
8666433 they argue that while serving illinois as its junior senator and earlier when the democratic candidate for president was a state lawmaker obama didnt do enough to make violent crime a priority specifically they point to obamas votes over gun legislation and the death penalty
8666434 democrat barack obama met yesterday with texas oil baron and longtime conservative activist t boone pickens to discuss strategies for developing alternative energy
8666435 the presidential hopeful praised pickens a native of oklahoma as a legendary entrepreneur and deflected a question about the billionaires role in helping to fund a television ad campaign that undermined john f kerry the 2004 democratic nominee you know hes got a longer track record than that obama told reporters when asked about pickenss association with the ads by a group called swift boat veterans for truth
8666436 democrat barack obama has had about a 3 to 1 advantage over republican john mccain in post page 1 stories since obama became his partys presumptive nominee june 4
8666437 in overall political stories from june 4 to friday obama dominated by 142 to 96 obama has been featured in 35 stories on page 1 mccain has been featured in 13 with three page 1 references with photos to stories on inside pages
8666438 i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins
8666439 i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction
8666440 i am not standing in his way i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is his need to throw a tantrum for the whole world to hear is
8666441 he michael has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8666442 he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it
8666443 his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has to fame if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it
8666444 people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay

8666450 as i explained in a recent article the russian word zhid is many times worse than using the n word for a black in america
8666451 they started using that word after about 30 million russians had been slaughtered by russian zionist zhid communists and then lost another 20 million in world war ii imagine that 50 million dead at the hands of zionist zhids
8666452 they rant and whine like psychotic little bitches about 6 million they cannot document and about which they refuse all efforts to scientifically academically investigate their claims about that number lost in that alleged nightmare during wwii

8666465 we have to show that this is not the case
8666466 it is clear that the notion of cartel seems to us totally inappropriate
8666467 as unlisted companies and shipyards are not obligated to announce order cancellations order cancellations thus far could be much greater than the handful that have announced
8666468 we believe that the degree of order cancellations could be particularly high by speculators who are unable to get financing and have placed orders with smaller unlisted china yards
8666469 anecdotal evidence from shipping industry participants indicates that up to 75 of newbuild orders across all ship types may not have secured financing and 30 150bn of the newbuild orders could face a shortage of debt financing

8666476 the wii is a well made device that has found a new target group for a while we held the same target group with the singstar karaoke game but perhaps we neglected to pursue that avenue
8666477 the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us

8666479 the wii is a well made device that has found a new target group for a while we held the same target group with the singstar karaoke game but perhaps we neglected to pursue that avenue playstation games are rather designed for those who play a lot

8666482 when this new legislation will be in force finland will have one of the most competitive tonnage tax legislations in europe
8666483 finnish shipowners are very satisfied with these measures that the finnish government announced today this long waited historic legislation package finally gives also to finnish shipowners the same possibilities that most shipowners in the other eu countries already have had for many years
8666484 the new system will be more flexible and understands the needs of the shipowners more
8666485 it seems the government has also solved some of the problem so it will encourage ship and environmental investments

8666509 we are addressing the safety issue but what we dont want to do is put in a permanent school flasher zone and then install a traffic signal because they conflict with each other

8666563 we arent just going to accept everything the company proposes we have our own ideas about how to keep the company profitable and we want them to be part of the discussion
8666564 we are looking at a number of things anything and everything is on the table
8666565 too often in the past the company has just gone ahead with layoffs and other actions without discussing it with the unions
8666566 thats not a model of cooperation that will help us solve these issues we have to move forward working together as partners

8666580 they win games because of who they are sometimes thats what they did winning 13 12 over amanda clearcreek on friday and were just working hard and trying not to blink were going to play them for all weve got
8666581 i dont worry about who we play or who we dont play or how good a team is
8666582 offensively were running an option attack and everything revolves around albrecht
8666583 he is far and away the fastest guy on our team and one of the strongest we made a conscious decision to have him touch the ball as much as possible
8666584 we want to try to make newark catholic do what they dont want to do
8666585 i go into every game wanting to stop the run
8666586 we are going to have to be aggressive up front and plug the holes on defense without giving up too much
8666587 on offense we are going to miss marcus but we are going to have to get focused because waynedale is a tough tough opponent our kids have to put last week behind them because we have a lot of work this week
8666588 the biggest thing we need to do on offense is to hang on to the football
8666589 we also put the ball on the ground a couple other times but we recovered our focus this week is get back to fundamentals and take care of the football
8666590 we have really focused on tackling and fundamentals on defense
8666591 sometimes to the spectator you look at it and see we got beat by an x amount of points but as a coach we saw a lot of good things we can build on
8666592 the way you win football games is through ball control
8666593 the most important thing was our control one thing that we also stress is be in control of your emotions try not to get caught up in the tempo of the game and just be in charge i think our kids did a good job of that
8666594 i think it was a good example of what we need to do to raise our game up
8666595 a lot of it is the physical end of it that is the most important aspect of the game i think we came away with an understanding that the game is played at a different level and we havent experienced that level now we have to move our game up to that level i compared it when i was at ashland university and we played youngstown state we lost but in the loss it set us up better because we then knew how to raise our game we played at a higher level after that i think it helped our kids to see what the game is played like at a championship level lexington really played hard and they were an intense football team they are going to win a lot of games how can we get to that level we have to take a good look at ourselves and see in what aspect we need to raise our game up
8666596 we are looking at several different players at different positions
8666597 we are trying to strengthen our team from a depth standpoint we are thin there is no question about that we have to try and broaden our depth
8666598 it is unfortunate we lost montgomery he was entering into a lot of things we were doing he was just running sprints when he stepped in a hole
8666599 it is always going to be a challenge because teams always have their best skill at the skill positions wide receiver offensive backs and quarterback we are going to see a good offensive back in woosters tailback
8666600 he ran the ball hard last week their quarterback is a younger guy but they have some good wide receivers well see a good offense but not as skilled as what we saw last week
8666601 we have some bright spots but we have to tie everything together if we can put out offense in a good position and use ball control to score if we can get our defense out on the field and keep the opposition out of the end zone and if our special teams continue to play solid i think we will have an opportunity to win
8666602 we have a lot of good kids and they understand the role they play in the community there is life outside of basketball and this helps them realize that
8666603 our kids play a big role from setup to help serve and teardown we do this because we want them to be involved in the community we also do this to show our appreciation for the support the community gives us

8666618 the event is a unique opportunity for everyone to see how much young sporting talent we have in the uk across a range of sports while the athletes will get the chance to experience a major multi sport event
8666619 through my role as the 2008 uk school games ambassador ive been working closely with schools across the region to share how the event can have a hugely positive impact not just on those competing but for all young people as they learn about sport and the many benefits it can bring

8666623 2008 well do it this year live video is just something that weve always wanted to do weve never had the resources to do it correctly but now with google we hope to actually launch something this year
8666624 but our source says that google has never really seriously considered a live video service were told that the notion was discussed months after chens statement but that the idea was tabled for a variety of reasons chief among them it would add significantly to googles infrastructure and bandwidth costs at a time when its trying to prove that the 1 65 billion it paid to buy the company will at some point pay off
8666625 were told that youtube execs estimated that if just 10 of the services users took advantage of live streaming the company would have to add 20 to 25 to its huge server and bandwidth infrastructure to support it given that advertising dollars for live streaming are even scarcer than they are on conventional web video thats a significant investment with minimal near term return youtubes sales team is still trying to figure out how to sell the inventory it already has

8666630 unlike most kids i never went through a backstreet boys phase
8666631 i grew up listening to classic rock the whole ac dc led zeppelin thing that was from my parents era so once i started listening to bands that had pop influences it sort of opened up a whole new world to me that i never had experienced
8666632 from the very beginning of working on this record i felt very hands on i knew exactly what i wanted it to sound like and that made the process a little more relaxed and enjoyable
8666633 i felt so much freedom while writing and recording and that gave me confidence to explore making music that puts people in a good mood you cant feel depressed listening to fun dance pop after all
8666634 i cant wait for everyone to hear these songs that are a little more carefree and put you in a good mood
8666635 sure like my other albums there are moments when i allow myself to be more vulnerable but i think songs like make some noise are a reminder that christians can have fun too and thats exactly what its like to feel the joy and freedom of gods love
8666636 all i need to keep in mind in life is that its not about the little things that get me all stressed out which is easier said than done obviously my life should be about my faith trying to react to situations and treat people the way jesus did living the way he lived i think maybe this is the reason why i am here to experience life the way jesus experienced life

8666775 the question becomes how does that translate i think hes got an uphill battle
8666776 i think he has potential if he continues this run
8666777 he represents a kind of next phase of young politics not only in this district but nationwide

8666798 when youre in a conversation with a client its important to lead the conversation to where you want it to be you must get from point a where the client usually is to point b which is where you want it to be
8666799 a good salesperson anticipates where the conversation is going and steers it so he can make his points and talk about the benefits the client will receive
8666800 you have to imagine yourself as a third person looking in on these two people who are talking imagine that you are outside the conversation but listening very carefully you have to know when the conversation is drifting so you can get it back on track you have to listen lt 196 gt and watch lt 196 gt for closing signals recognize them and move when you hear them
8666801 its almost like a graduate course in selling our product
8666802 it contains the best ideas produced by the most successful people in our company during the past you have to be serious about improving your selling you have to learn your industry and learn your product
8666803 most salespeople fail because they get to a point where they think they know it all nobody knows it all im the president and i certainly dont know it all
8666804 if obama wins theres a chance to make a real impact if not were screwed
8666805 the package announced by the prime minister is satisfactory at the moment to tackle the gigantic task of reaching relief to over 20 lakh people affected by the floods in the four district with the kosi changing course inundating vast areas
8666806 apart from the estimated due of rs 2500 crores the state spent on providing relief to the flood hit areas in bihar during last years rainy season we will require more assistance from the centre for reconstructing villages run camps for relief for the next three to four months construct sanitary toilets and solve housing problems
8666807 we have to be ready for sheltering more than 10 lakh people in mega relief camps as polythenesheets cant serve the purpose
8666808 thank you thank the god above that we are safe it is as if we are reborn
8666809 our hope for survival is receding fast i dont know if i will be able to speak to you again
8666810 we shout from the rooftop at the sight of every boat that passes from a distance but nobody listens there is no relief only the sight of airforce helicopters flying about we are doomed
8666811 i had to pay rs 4000 to a local boatman for ferrying myself and family hardly a couple of kilometres the local strongmen who own boats are fleecing the already miserable flood victims
8666812 we are fast running out of supplies and have received no relief from the government in a couple of days we may begin to starve
8666813 they are looking for a democratic party and a democratic party leader who gets their crisis who is waking up and every second of the day is focused on it and who is going to battle to bring this economy back to bring the middle class back
8666814 i actually dont think this election is going to be particularly close
8666815 i think people are going to decide you know what we want change and we can go with this or the republicans will succeed in scaring people out of changing
8666816 whole nature is hes kind of a suave kind of cool guy a lot of his demeanor is cool and calm
8666817 i will not relent till the demand is met by the government by announcing in principle that the 400 acres will be returned to farmers only then will the tata motors plant be allowed to come up otherwise our movement will be intensified
8666818 we cannot be purchased our commitment is to the people not to an industrialist
8666819 i dont aspire to be the chief minister nor do i hanker after any posts i work for the poor and the downtrodden we are here for last five days spending sleepless nights
8666820 systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process
8666821 agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything
8666822 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8666823 anyone who says i shouldnt be allowed to adopt children is anti gay
8666824 rescued them from the foster system when good white straight parents didnt want them
8666825 can give a good speech with a teleprompter but thats about it
8666826 were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8666827 his family heritage and life experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation in an ever more interdependent world
8666828 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8666829 we simply cant drill our way to energy independence even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant even remember
8666830 theyre asking for another four years in a just world theyd get ten to 20
8666831 the strong expectation of the government for decisive preventative and repressive action on the part of indian authorities
8666832 to work together to restore peaceful co existence and harmony between the different religious communities
8666833 while firmly condemning the attacks on human lives whose sacred character must be respected by all i extend my spiritual comfort and solidarity to the monks and nuns who have been put through such a difficult test
8666834 si le projet est bien inscrit dans la transposition en droit fran ais de la troisi me directive europ enne postale de 2009 alors le changement de statut pourra tre effectif en janvier 2010
8666835 la poste avait besoin de 2 5 3 5 milliards deuros pour son d veloppement et cela sans compter d ventuelles grosses acquisitions

8666854 la envidia que ortega tiene por la estatura moral mundial del poeta
8666855 si me quieren echar preso y en este sistema que hay ahora en nicaragua todo es posible estoy listo para ir a la c rcel
8666856 se trata de un fallo objetivo yo apel el fallo del juez de menor instancia subi al de distrito quien decidi que s hab a m rito para condenar al se or cardenal por el delito de injurias por qu hasta ahora hombr no te lo puedo explicar pero creo que tiene que ver con el proceso de limpieza de casos viejos que se est dando en los juzgados
8666857 es simplemente una venganza de daniel ortega por la acogida que tuve en paraguay durante la toma de posesi n del presidente lugo mientras a l se le impidi llegar afirm el sacerdote trapense
8666858 juez danielista que en tiempos de la revoluci n fue miembro de la seguridad del estado y es el mismo que posteriormente absolvi a byron jerez y el abogado que ha respaldado al alem n zerger es precisamente el mismo abogado de daniel ortega jos ram n rojas m ndez
8666859 de todo tipo de mentiras insultos y calumnias con la intenci n de apropiarse de un hotel propiedad de la asociaci n para el desarrollo de solentiname
8666860 de este sistema judicial no pod s esperar otras cosas sobre todo cuando responde a intereses pol ticos de daniel ortega
8666861 se trata de una manifiesta manipulaci n de los tribunales lo cual debe ser causa de aflicci n para el pa s porque se trata de una acci n temeraria en contra de una figura que tiene una relevancia mundial y no tiene otro calificativo m s que de una barbarie
8666862 y podr amos ver un alud de nieve gigantesco en contra de los autores de la barbarie
8666863 porque ante estas situaciones debemos ser solidarios sobre todo con figuras como ernesto que han puesto muy en alto el nombre de nicaragua
8666864 imaginate que se trata de un caso por el que el mismo sistema judicial ya lo hab a absuelto y que lo traen a colaci n ahora que el poeta ha sido homenajeado en paraguay es decir todo apunta a una decisi n de orden pol tico
8666865 esto no es m s que una demostraci n de debilidad del gobierno esto se llama miedo porque saben el peso que tiene la voz de ernesto cardenal y por eso vamos a denunciar este atropello a nivel internacional porque somos solidarios con l y lo advertimos no est solo y un ataque contra ernesto es un ataque contra todos nosotros las y los escritores del pa s
8666866 no es m s que una muestra de la cobard a con que act an los que ostentan el poder en contra de quienes se muestran cr ticos y adversos
8666867 esto es horrible lo que est pasando y te digo que es tanto as que no encuentro palabras para describirte lo que siento
8666868 estoy impactada de ver la arbitrariedad y el abuso que se est cometiendo en contra de personalidades que lo nico que han hecho es poner en lo m s alto el nombre de nicaragua y que dedic su vida a la revoluci n estoy espantada porque estamos volviendo a lo m s puro del somocismo
8666869 una venganza pol tica de daniel ortega y rosario murillo y es para obligar a callar a todo el mundo
8666870 lo que no pudo hacer el somocismo no lo podr n hacer rosario murillo y daniel ortega ste es un gobierno vengativo venga traidos pol ticos y pretende callar a todo el mundo ste no es hecho aislado es s lo una represi n m s
8666871 es una jugada m s del r gimen que est utilizando a su juguete favorito que es el poder judicial para premiar a amigos y castigar a adversarios esta vez ni siquiera tuvieron el tacto de dejar pasar un tiempo sino que lo hacen inmediatamente despu s de lo ocurrido en paraguay es decir no se guardan las apariencias y embisten de manera directa
8666872 quieren responsabilizar al padre de la falta de acogida del presidente en paraguay parece que hay una envidia por el nivel de reconocimiento que tiene el poeta y que lo va a seguir teniendo esto evidencia que seguimos en camino hacia el autoritarismo en el r gimen m s intolerante que ha habido desde somoza porque la consigna es est s conmigo o contra m
8666873 est s como una veleta o tu extra a regla
8666874 yo puedo apoyar que cierren partidos electorales como ocurri recientemente con el mrs pues la democracia electoral me es incomprensible pero su nombre ernesto cardenal no es un partido electoral su nombre y su accionar est n ligado a los mejores tiempos de la nicaragua revolucionaria y su envestidura merece mucha m s consideraci n y reverencia
8666875 we wanted to maintain a working relationship with you but we just couldnt justify the cost of giving you our business any longer
8666876 weve been doing business with you for a long time and wed really like to continue but weve been having a hard time justifying your prices there are just too many others standing at our door willing to do just about anything they can to get our business frankly theyve made it impossible for us to stay with you im really sorry
8666877 it has become too difficult to justify the price of doing business with you
8666878 many selling situations put both seller and prospect in an adversarial position this creates fear
8666879 you can calm your prospects buying fears and almost eliminate your own fear of selling
8666880 she had her faculties and she made it clear that she did not want her feeding tube removed
8666881 she could laugh and she could giggle and she could shake her head yes and no
8666882 the injunction says he raymond weber has to adhere to reasonable medical advice but he can make those decisions as long as the feeding tube and ventilator are kept in place
8666883 the white house is essentially saying were above the law the rest of the rest of the world has to follow the law thats not the way it works just because someone works in the white house theyre subject to the same laws as everybody else i intend to keep on and if theyre trying to run out the clock to the end of this congress i remind them ill still be chairman next year
8666884 we had just left templetons crossing and had walked up over the top of mt bellamy and were coming back down to the next campground when some of the hikers stopped to take photos of the natural canopy above the trail
8666885 one of them zoomed in on what appeared to be a body
8666886 when the wind blew you could see it appeared to be hanging by a cable
8666887 it appears to be sitting in an aluminium harness and hanging from a cable so that leads us to believe its an airman
8666888 the location of the find is near a flight path commonly used by allied aircraft during world war ii sorties
8666889 a number of allied aircraft have been reported as missing in this area
8666890 these include a b 25 mitchell and a number of kittyhawks
8666891 if it is a body it is a significant find
8666892 unfortunately there are many in that part of the world that have never been found
8666893 every step would be taken to identify the body and accord it a proper burial
8666894 from the moment we met on the set of changi mark became a true loyal and constantly entertaining friend
8666895 a great man and an exceptional actor his loss is devastating my sincerest condolences go to his family thanks for all the laughs old mate rest in peace
8666896 when you grow up on a farm you learn very quickly that death follows life
8666897 theatre i find much more challenging than tv or film
8666898 you really have to be present when youre performing on stage whereas on tv you only have to be present for one take and then you can relax
8666899 i cannot name the two companies but they are really on the brink and we are doing our best to help them but it is a very difficult task
8666900 it has a massive effect on suppliers and it is fair to say that 3000 jobs could go following the ford losses
8666901 this is a tragic situation for these workers and many companies are facing the position where they want to defer redundancy payments which is not very popular with their employees
8666902 our policy is backed by australias leading drug and medical experts
8666903 we refuse to have a policy that is name and shame and which benefits no one
8666904 if you triple the sample size and the percentage of positive drug tests goes down then the trend of drug use is going down
8666905 in each and every moment mark spent with us on all saints he gave his all
8666906 to have worked with him was a privilege to have been able to call him a friend was a priceless gift
8666907 he had the most extraordinary combination of very deft comic touch and great emotional depth
8666908 i worked with him on stage and on screen and will miss him more than i can say right now
8666909 mark the actor was intuitive and graced every scene in which he appeared with a touch of whimsical genius that only he could apply
8666910 his work as an actor is always inventive and his performance in all saints is a joy to watch
8666911 he proved himself a classic comedian with a natural charm and ability to improvise
8666912 i saw him in a number of other stage productions and am convinced he had a great career ahead of him
8666913 he was surrounded by a close network of friends who were aware of his emotional fragility and gave him all the support they could
8666914 clearly no serious response to climate change can ignore the need to reduce emissions from australias coal fired electricity generation sector
8666915 im so excited ill be meeting eamon sullivan all by myself
8666916 next time shes in town shell find some time to meet up and make a happy fan which wasnt the case yesterday
8666917 stef was bloody upset to see someone left in that state
8666918 this is the first pregnancy at the zoo its not just the first birth we have to manage the pregnancy manage the birth shes a first time mum
8666919 childhood obesity is a highly complex issue and the review found there was not a sufficient consensus on the impact of banning food and beverage advertising on obesity levels
8666920 contrary to what acma suggests there is plenty of evidence to suggest a ban on advertising is an important component of a broad strategy to address overweight and obesity particularly in children
8666921 recent comprehensive and systematic reviews of the evidence show that food advertising affects what children eat what they prefer to eat and what they pester their parents for
8666922 the food industry spends over 200 million a year on advertising and a significant part of this is used to promote unhealthy high fat high salt high sugar foods
8666923 it is little wonder a quarter of children are overweight or obese
8666924 this will have severe ramifications for their future health with obesity linked to a range of chronic diseases
8666925 we dont have any desire to take to the street just like that i will be happy if the government strictly implements the provision for mandatory marathi signboards
8666926 comessere porria che non fece follia cristo la spene mia om lavesse pigliato

8666928 mr pather pulled out his gun and defended himself a shoot out took place and one intruder was shot dead at the scene pather suffered wounds and was rushed to hospital but was declared dead on arrival
8666929 he has been robbed a number of times recently and had acquired a gun to defend himself he was getting fed up with the crime wave
8666930 this was senseless they didnt have to kill reggie he was harmless crime is spiraling out of control and the government needs to do something before more innocent lives are lost criminals seem to have a free rein and are taking the law into their own hands
8666931 they show witches can be a force for good so its no wonder people are trying witchcraft its an exciting way of life
8666932 if were going to change the future of childrens health we must teach them how to make healthy lifestyle choices and we have to make it fun for them thats where disney comes in
8666933 we wanted to focus on nature themes to create a welcoming environment
8666934 with your unemployment growth there will be more people who use the er because they dont have a family doctor
8666935 there are more urgent care facilities in the county similar to an er but im not sure everyone knows that they exist
8666936 they are seen whether they have insurance or not when presented with a bill it depends on what their income is we write off as charity care anything over 200 percent of federal poverty level
8666937 generally speaking its those with insurance that are covering those without insurance in premiums to insurance companies and hospital charges to cover the price of doing business
8666938 we are primary care so we wont hear about that folks come in and get family doctoring with us we dont ask because our job is public health it is fair to assume that some are but we heard nothing about that
8666939 there are a lot of urban legends out there and i think this is one them
8666940 in most of the cases they hospitals wouldnt want to draw attention to themselves
8666941 i do know a number of people who live with what is going on until it gets so bad that they go to an emergency room in the hospital
8666942 i am certain that immigrants do take advantage of those walk in clinics
8666943 the american people simply cannot afford more of the same
8666944 which means more government spending more special interest pay offs more fraud and waste and continuing to treat american taxpayers like geese to be plucked rather than citizens of a free society and democratic republic
8666945 i will give you free healthcare free education free childcare free housing free this and free that
8666946 we want to fix the shortage instead of creating a situation where hospitals have to shift the nursing workload to lesser trained workers
8666947 its not un doable but its very hard its not something thats going to be taken care of right away
8666948 thousands of qualified students are turned away from nursing programs each year as a result of insufficient faculty
8666949 we would determine in general whether or not the protective equipment was adequate
8666950 i am not sure i am more inclined to think that it is a hopper because the antenna is not visible and also the shape of the wing in the picture in that there is a bend in the interior margin to accommodate the scutellum references
8666951 you can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world but when youre finished youll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird so lets look at the bird and see what its doing thats what counts i learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something

8666955 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
8666956 we not the senate were all my father cared about he decided not to take the oath of office he said delaware can get another senator but my boys cant get another father however great men like ted kennedy mike mansfield hubert humphrey men who have been tested in their own right convinced him to serve he was sworn in at my bedside
8666957 as a single parent he decided to be there to put us to bed to be there when we woke from a bad dream to make us breakfast so he traveled to and from washington four hours a day
8666958 be there for my dad like he was for me
8666959 i see you do neurodegenerative disease research our community partners this year are in that field alzheimers sma and als

8666961 well that wasnt the best ive ever played those two pieces thats for sure
8666962 this makes clear that the bank is definitely going to be sold
8666963 this is the best fta model that asean has negotiated so far it is comprehensive in scope covering most of the sectors and sub sectors
8666964 that is their australia and new zealand approach they have been practising this for a long time we asean are taking this advantage to negotiate with them this is an important agreement for us asean
8666965 we expect the aanzfta will take effect by next year
8666966 faced with pressure from a tight monetary stance fiscal policy should become more active to prevent an excessive drop in economic growth
8666967 we believe there is likely to be a temporary rebound in october after these restrictions are lifted but the underlying activity growth momentum will continue to be soft
8666968 it could be cut only if there was a large outflow of hot money
8666969 were not sure of the motive yet its still part of an ongoing investigation
8666970 the group is pleased to have achieved another good set of results in this interim period our efforts in optimising the usage of our plantation assets continued to boost our ffb output to 97 176 metric tonnes for the first half of fy08 an increase compared to the same period in the last financial year
8666971 we are also optimistic of protons future based on strong sales of the persona special edition and the saga
8666972 we aim to grow our current market share of 34 4 per cent january to july period representing almost 40 000 passenger cars and we also aim to double our exports to 36 000 by year end
8666973 indonesia for example is a very exciting market for us which has 13 outlets now from four and we plan to bring in the saga and persona by year end
8666974 placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts
8666975 bulldozes through controversy hosted the dali lama chastised mugabe and wants to make the euro a bigger player in global financial markets as the dollar wanes
8666976 could be felt as a provocation on the part of the population of alto adige 99 per cent of whom are catholic
8666977 not art but a blasphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that offends many people
8666978 injured the feelings of many people who see in the cross the symbol of the love of god and of our salvation which deserves recognition and religious devotion
8666979 not only wounds the religious feelings of many who see in the cross the symbol of the love of god but also offends the good sense and feelings of those who do not identify with the symbol
8666980 please tell everyone in russia in the world that we want to be with russia we dont want saakashvili he has brought us nothing but trouble
8666981 we dont need nato we dont need america we need to be friends with russia
8666982 were all people who have been through a lot in our lives were not easily scared
8666983 but now we are all scared many people have died here who will defend us who will look after us we are left here all alone
8666984 we dont know what to do we need medicines doctors but nothing is coming
8666985 russia protected georgia for hundreds of years weve always been close to russia
8666986 the ossetians behaved like dogs but if russia is our friend then the ossetians will be our friends too
8666987 true enough learning to live in a post fact society
8666988 we recognise there is an urgent need for industry and government to collaborate to enable people to connect to the internet
8666989 the internet is capable of transforming lives and the future of our country through the connected indians movement we hope to achieve precisely that
8666990 the connected indians movement will bring with it rapid broadband deployment and help harness the powers of internet to accelerate inclusive social and economic change
8666991 the certificate of birth produced by him in this regard along with his affidavit has been obtained by misrepresentation of facts and in a fraudulent manner since the given birth place was neither in existence nor phanindranath sarkar was its owner during and prior to 1958
8666992 the school initially didnt tell us that she has fallen from the fifth floor we came to know about it later she was not someone who would commit suicide
8666993 we want a thorough investigation into the case by the central bureau of investigation the truth should come out we have also requested the police to take us to her room in the hostel
8666994 she was competing with herself she may have been stressed due to studies she had scored less in two monday tests
8666995 she got 26 marks out of 40 in her english test and because of that she may have been depressed according to her classmates she was very studious and was always occupied with books
8666996 let the police probe the matter the school is shocked and sad
8666997 the case is still open and we are waiting for the postmortem report before the investigations are taken forward and we come to any conclusion
8666998 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subjected to over a long period by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8666999 when theres so many discrimination cases coming out by ethnic minorities that speaks for itself
8667000 i think that there are even further allegations against sir ian at the moment which are probably just as serious i think its an accumulation of many allegations against him
8667001 the course of the economy shaped by whopping capex plans show signs of a feel good factor among industrialists the massive investment announcements in the past six months will boost the overall employment situation in the country
8667002 no fue bueno no era necesario no me consta porque no lo vi fue un error haberlo dicho
8667003 what has six legs and scares some people a committed threesome or maybe just a bug

8667006 habr a que resaltar algo que es muy importante cu nto bajamos en el medallero en qu lugar nos encontramos a comparaci n de lo que fueron los juegos ol mpicos pasados y desde hace cu nto no se consegu an estas medallas

8667053 hes a great american and a great and dear friend and i rely on him and i have for many years
8667054 they need about a half a trillion dollars in borrowing authority and they need a vehicle to own these banks while we triage them and sell them
8667055 if we are way over 1990s levels by say the third quarter then i would tell you theres going to be some institutions that may not be able to raise private capital and may need a bridge
8667056 we dont think this credit cycle has bottomed out yet
8667057 i dont like to make predictions but i think its going to continue to be very challenging and as i said i think the number of banks and assets on the troubled bank list will continue to go up
8667058 i am delighted that swfs sovereign wealth fairies continue to express confidence in the terrific values represented by american financial institutions as i have been saying since august of 2007 this shows that the crisis is now over
8667059 vicious rumors attacking the tooth fairy will not be tolerated our entire financial system and indeed the american way of life depend on the tooth fairy and wishing upon a star how else could one value level iii capital appropriately
8667060 i dont see these changes making a dramatic difference in how the whole fannie and freddie fiasco plays out
8667061 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
8667062 most managers are taking the position that it would unthinkable to imagine a scenario where the government wouldnt back the debt
8667063 the end result is probably going to be that they go bankrupt and the government nationalizes the function
8667064 i paulson understand that their share prices are irrelevant as long as the government backs their debts you mr market are testing my will but soon you will understand too then fannie and freddie shares will recover investors will realize their taxpayer backed business model is going to survive and will step forward to provide whatever amount of capital their regulator specifies bill miller the legg mason fund guru whos been on a bad run lately was prescient when he doubled down on freddies shares
8667065 hank paulson ran an investment bank he understands that its very important that there be an attractive shareholder proposition so that investment comes into the company so that the companys capital is built
8667066 as a test of investor demand it would appear that the troubled housing agency passed this time
8667067 major japanese institutional investors are likely to have sold agency bonds
8667068 although fannie and freddie are being aided by the government there still is no guarantee on their debt so it is difficult to hold it
8667069 without a guarantee nobody will do anything as its too risky so they sold the bonds
8667070 the forex market volatility has been so high that some investors are reluctant to hold foreign bond assets
8667071 increasing uncertainty about whether government support will extend to these securities in the context of further deterioration
8667072 we continue to monitor exchange markets closely and co operate as appropriate
8667073 anticipation of a quick rate cut by the ecb now seems to be fading on the back of comments by bank members and this has helped lift the euro away from recent dollar lows
8667074 suggests a more stable dollar in the long run which should help keep overall foreign exchange market volatility low
8667075 the sharp decline in house prices persisted into august as weak buyer confidence and tight lending criteria continued to weigh on the market
8667076 pick up somewhat in the second half of this year
8667077 a number worried about the possibility that core inflation might fail to moderate next year
8667078 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening the timing and extent of any change in policy stance would depend on evolving economic and financial developments
8667079 terms and standards had been tightened on nearly all categories of loans
8667080 increased capital pressures on lenders exposed to real estate markets
8667081 the extent of such adverse effects was likely to be limited
8667082 my feeling is that the recession started in the fourth quarter of 2007
8667083 i think the worst quarter will be the first quarter of 2009 which would make it a long recession
8667084 mostly what this report will say is when you give somebody an 1 800 check he spends it
8667085 with slowing of economies abroad that gain from trade doesnt look sustainable
8667086 you have to reach a bottom in housing before youll see a turn
8667087 as we continue to hear more bad economic news we will continue to see bankruptcies spiral upwards
8667088 any buyer would have to pay for the firm then pay again for the people
8667089 mbia wouldnt do the deal unless they thought they were going to make money
8667090 could prove invaluable in helping lift the ratings of municipal bonds
8667091 mbia ambac and fgic all three are being thrown in the same bucket
8667092 the bonds are trading as if they dont exist as if there is no insurance
8667093 severely impaired financial flexibility and the companys proximity to minimum regulatory requirements
8667094 broker dealers are an endangered species wall street needs them to help the likes of the swaps market to function to clear their trades and provide credit lehman is core to the whole liquidity issue on wall street what makes them vulnerable is that unlike banks such as morgan stanley they have no retail business no retail accounts if institutions get scared they can pull their money out in a phone call its not the same if you have a massive retail base
8667095 it gave me pause but not enough to not proceed with the paperwork
8667096 im breathing a sigh of relief that i applied and was approved three months ago versus today because i dont see on the immediate horizon any good news for the credit markets
8667097 we are starting to see the onset of a second round of effects primarily concentrated in residential and commercial development lending that affects more institutions and probably will play out over a longer period of time
8667098 the industry as a whole remains well positioned to meet the credit needs of local communities
8667099 its not an unfair concern but i dont know how one really gets around it were located here and this is our market
8667100 your fortunes are tied to the place where you operate
8667101 current economic conditions require prudent management and conservation of capital
8667102 its the action of the banks not the performance of the builders
8667103 the builders are performing okay in general but what the banks have done is changed the rules
8667104 clearly the aggregate access that our guests have to credit cards is one of the issues that is determining our same store sales performance in the current environment
8667105 aggressive reduction of credit lines and significant tightening of all aspects of our underwriting
8667106 part of that is just obviously with people having more economic difficulties their credit scores are falling across the country
8667107 the company knowingly stole from its customers mostly poor people and the recently deceased when it designed and implemented the sweeps
8667108 when a whistleblower uncovered the scam and brought it to his superiors they buried the information and continued the illegal practice
8667109 we take issue with the states characterization of our conduct and the parties voluntary settlement
8667110 this agreement affirms our actions and we are continuing to make full refunds to all affected customers
8667111 immediate measures that aim to significantly reduce the risk profile of the corporate and investment banking division and then more structural reforms aiming to focus resources on our strong points
8667112 theyve cut the prices of flats a lot because people dont have any money you could say we are in poverty here
8667113 we were looking for an investment for our retirement but so far weve lost 90 000
8667114 i think this is going to be the biggest fallout that anyones ever seen because of the sheer amount of properties
8667115 the collateral that we take must also be traded in the market because only then is it priced accurately
8667116 any changes from the ecb are likely to place further upward pressure on interbank repo rates
8667117 there is therefore a risk that banks use the ecb as lender of first resort rather than last resort
8667118 since at least the beginning of 2008 persistent market talk has it that spanish and dutch banks may be in that game getting an effective subsidy from the ecb and becoming overly dependent on the ecb as the funding source of first choice
8667119 this may affect negatively the profitability of spanish banks and their ability to lend
8667120 we see bonds being issued just to forward them directly to the ecb
8667121 one reason for that is the tighter credit conditions and anything which exacerbates that is bad news
8667122 if the ecb restricts the possibilities for using asset backed bonds in refinancing operations the market spread will widen again
8667123 such a tightening will hurt the part of the euro zone economy which is weakest right now
8667124 we have to adjust our framework regularly to market practices
8667125 if we see banks dependent on central banks then we must push them to tap other sources of funding
8667126 theres a limit how long you can do this there is a point where you take over the market
8667127 the lender of last resort should be just that not a permanent provider of funds
8667128 a number have been issuing mortgage securities for the sole purpose of drawing funds from frankfurt
8667129 these banks are heavily reliant on short term and medium funding from the capital markets this spigot of credit is now almost entirely closed
8667130 these properties were targeted by speculative purchasers who thought they could make a quick buck by flipping them that is not the buy to let market buy to let investors do not own a property unless they can demonstrate that there is tenant demand
8667131 todays figures defy hopes that the housing market is bottoming out any time soon and is in line with the bank of englands downbeat economic assessment
8667132 as a result of this new negative data consumer and business surveys consistently show that the fear of an actual recession dominates
8667133 with inflation doggedly remaining high the question remains will europe enter stagflation stagnation plus high inflation or even worse a genuine recession
8667134 while germany and to a lesser extent france are likely to show some resilience thanks to strong fundamentals the spanish economy is bound to experience at least two quarters of negative growth which would qualify it as being in a technical recession
8667135 britain looks likely to be the first major economy to fall into recession
8667136 there is a growing danger that the downturn will be exacerbated by a contraction in bank lending to households and companies
8667137 no change the godawful bear market goes on and on
8667138 weak and almost certain to get weaker there is nothing to fall back on it is probably too late to avoid the two quarters of negative growth that constitute a technical recession
8667139 weve been experiencing a slow motion meltdown what were suffering really deserves to be called a recession theres no end to the pain in sight
8667140 things will probably get considerably worse before they get better
8667141 i think in canada if were not in recession were mighty close to it
8667142 its one of those funny recessions though in that domestic demand is still very positive and real incomes are actually rising because of the rising commodity prices
8667143 while we think that growth will remain ever so slightly in the black we wouldnt rule out a back to back negative print that would meet the definition of a technical recession
8667144 what we are about to see is a race to the bottom by the worlds major currencies as each tries to devalue against others in a beggar thy neighbour policy to shore up exports
8667145 at a time when asia is under pressure from external forces strong and stable leadership is crucial
8667146 is a lot more stable politically than many foreigners seem to realize
8667147 great franchise which has existed through many crises through a long period of time
8667148 the government is helping us finance the purchase of new machinery
8667149 they reduced the interest rates we pay and have given us more time to pay off the loans its vital
8667150 in our country the government is trying to get money to subsidize other sectors of the economy
8667151 i think brazil is doing the opposite adapting to what the world is offering now theyre doing it right
8667152 we need to give incentives to producers because people are buying and eating more
8667153 this is our opportunity to produce and export more and help to reduce hunger in the world
8667154 our productivity cant remain the same if people are going to eat more
8667155 the feeling is that they are going to screw us again and so it is difficult to plan our short and medium term future
8667156 the problem has not been solved and it needs to be solved quickly
8667157 they have different approaches to what is happening in the world agricultural markets
8667158 short term volatility happens in all countries in the long term argentina has great potential to increase production and to continue to be a major exporter of grains and oil seeds
8667159 the swelling tide of toxic home loans is proving to be even more worrisome than initially feared

8667169 our policy is to rein in all fossil fuel subsidies
8667170 its much better to have a systemic approach rather than a piecemeal ad hoc approach
8667171 we expect to have an outcome from the process somewhere towards the end of september and at that time weve committed to provide further information to shareholders
8667172 based on current market conditions we are targeting growth in underlying eps earnings per share of at least 10 per cent for the 2008 09 financial year
8667173 if you have a look at the numbers overall they show that the domestic economy remains pretty robust
8667174 its down to the fact that the mining boom is having a significant impact but its not just mining you are seeing it across other areas as well with transportation and construction remaining quite strong
8667175 the important factor is that there are other economies around the world that are noticing a pretty significant slow down but were in a much more enviable position
8667176 it is reassuring for the reserve bank that the death of the australian economy is not at our doors yet
8667177 weve seen weakness in consumer sentiment weve seen weaker business sentiment numbers but really it hasnt translated into a weaker investment number yet
8667178 the supply side of the economy is pretty well primed to grow quite rapidly and absorb the inflationary pressures so wages will remain in check
8667179 what next you gonna make this into an opera or a ballet or maybe a video game
8667180 well thats a really bad idea because the main character suffers from autism and in my story the whole problem is that we never hear their the autistic persons side of the story
8667181 amp is a pretty sound company and its a solid result given the current environment
8667182 given the environment in australia with superannuation and youve got kiwisaver now in new zealand theres plenty of room to get good organic growth
8667183 demonstrates financial strength and the strength of the business model
8667184 we saw very strong earnings in the insurance business and our businesses that are most impacted by the sharemarket also held up
8667185 the thing about asia is they are good savers and their wealth is increasing
8667186 if they tap into the right networks in asia and come up with the right product then they could make some really good money
8667187 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8667188 certainly had she been the democratic nominee that probably would have catapulted her higher

8667196 financially stronger more efficient and flexible and even better placed to grow at a faster than industry rate
8667197 there were a lot of concerns about how fast the economy was slowing with this strong capital expenditure theres a possibility that the gdp for q2 will be better than expected
8667198 the rba may not be as aggressive in its rate cuts
8667199 that is why we saw such a sharp sell off
8667200 the market has taken it at face value and taken out some of the probability of rate cuts across the strip
8667201 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
8667202 the russian president informed his chinese colleague about the situation in south ossetia and abkhazia
8667203 the divisions of the major studios who have released art house type product have poisoned the market by spending so much money to advertise those movies
8667204 its become impossible for people with smaller movies to compete and thats just thrown the whole market out of whack
8667205 one of the things frankly that makes me slightly optimistic is that the studios seem to be retrenching a little bit right now the fact that picturehouse and warner independent have been put out of their misery and the fact that paramount vantage has been folded into paramount if it reduces the amount of companies that are actually spending that kind of money it might actually reopen the market a little bit
8667206 at the end of the day its not time to even talk about those things for various different reasons you know nintendo whos still our silent partner a lot of people dont know that we have a great relationship with those guys its not time to talk about eternal darkness 2
8667207 he also said that the companys next game will be
8667208 economists often do disagree but that has not been true with respect to free trade and international trade ever since adam smith there has been virtual unanimity among economists whatever their ideological position on other issues that international free trade is in the best interests of trading countries and of the world
8667209 few measures that we could take would do more to promote the cause of freedom at home and abroad than complete free trade instead of making grants to foreign governments in the name of economic aid thereby promoting socialism while at the same time imposing restrictions on the products they produce thereby hindering free enterprise we could assume a consistent and principled stance we could say to the rest of the world we believe in freedom and intend to practice it we cannot force you to be free but we can offer full cooperation on equal terms to all our market is open to you without tariffs or other restrictions sell here what you can and wish to buy whatever you can and wish to in that way cooperation among individuals can be worldwide and free

8667211 our businesses have all got nice momentum as we move into the new financial year
8667212 were expecting this half to be very solid the way things are panning out for us

8667218 the full year 2009 outlook is going to be clouded by the victoria government decision to fragment the lottery market delays in approvals for new games and tougher comparables in the second half

8667240 white manages the neat trick of respecting the genres traditions while daring to nudge it toward something new and unexpected
8667241 a unique and artful blend of the pi novel and the police procedural with a story as deceptively simple as your first love and as fatal as your last car wreck a terrific novel

8667447 there are multiple factors that have produced the districts high hiv aids rate and it will take multiple factors to bring it down
8667448 in 2007 at least 26 states made efforts to expand coverage but as the economy has turned downward so have state efforts
8667449 reminds us that americans are suffering in a struggling economy too many of our neighbors are living in poverty and too many are living without health insurance
8667450 todays news confirms what americas struggling families already know that over the past seven years our economy has moved backwards
8667451 while this decline is a temporary victory for kids we fear next years data will paint a worse picture for americas children than ever before as the effects of a sluggish economy will be coupled with the inability of congress to pass renewal of schip over president bushs two vetoes
8667452 are expensive and when tax revenues fall it is going to be harder to keep them up
8667453 we have a much weaker economy than a year ago much higher inflation very unlikely that this trend will continue into 2008 vitez philadelphia inquirer 8 27
8667454 an opportunity for the private sector and the government to work together
8667455 states such as massachusetts have also played an important role in stemming the rising tide of uninsured and thanks to their health reform law they now have one of the lowest uninsured rates
8667456 but 45 7 million uninsured people are far too many and we need a national solution to this crisis
8667457 were entirely attributable to an increase in the number of people enrolled in medicaid and other public programs
8667458 is clear is that economic growth alone will not cut it for most american families
8667459 means more progressive taxation increasing access to affordable health care investing more in public education
8667460 president bush was too busy cutting taxes on top earners to think about any of these priorities the next president must do much better
8667461 truth be told we already have a government funded health care system we just pretend we dont
8667462 theres this supposed mix of private and public insurance but the fact is the u s government you know we the taxpayers spend nearly a quarter more for government health care programs than say canada a country that is supposed to have government controlled health care
8667463 looks great until you see that whats declining is private insurance coverage and whats increasing is the number of people eligible for government programs such as medicaid
8667464 its time to organize government health care into a single payer system one that covers all u s residents
8667465 a closer inspection of the numbers shows some dark clouds around the silver lining
8667466 while total enrollment in private insurance remained stable due to population growth it eroded slightly in percentage terms continuing a downward trend
8667467 growth in coverage was mostly concentrated in public programs partially due to an aging population shifting to medicare but especially in medicaid
8667468 each year a significant portion of the uninsured qualifies for government assistance but hasnt signed up
8667469 in other words the latest batch of data shows again that the policy problem of the uninsured isnt as large as election year opportunism would have it
8667470 the genuine hardships that the fragmented health care system metes out to many families
8667471 insurance is more expensive than it needs to be thanks to regulation and other market interference
8667472 who typically have less generous plans as part of their compensation
8667473 restoring the tax parity of health dollars would allow individuals to buy policies themselves rather than rely on their employers and take those policies with them wherever they work
8667474 while we acknowledge that prime minister rudds speech at the national press club today had education as its core message we were very disappointed that he made absolutely no mention of the urgent need to fix the rural health crisis in this country a crisis which is so very badly affecting the health outcomes and life expectancies of rural australians
8667475 in fact the last time we really heard the prime minister talking about the need to improve access to healthcare in the bush was soon after last years election
8667476 we are extremely disappointed that rural health seems to have dropped off the governments agenda any actionwe had hoped for in this critical area has been bogged down in a process of reviews many of which will continue on for another year
8667477 the governments own rural workforce audit released earlier this year confirmed the urgent need to get more doctors nurses and other health professionals into rural and remote australia
8667478 meanwhile we continue to see new reports released regularly which underline the much poorer health outcomes for rural and remote australians compared with those living in the cities
8667479 for example a report released just last week by the australian institute of health and welfare
8667480 it is not only cancer survival where rural and remote australians continue to be worse a long list of health outcomes for which rural australians are severely disadvantaged
8667481 it is terrific that the prime minister has the passion to drive forward an education revolution but rural doctors and rural communities across australia have been crying out for a rural health revolution for years and they are still waiting
8667482 rural communities need three central factors in order to be truly sustainable appropriate access to education appropriate access to local health services and employment opportunities getting more doctors and other health professionals to the bush and making real improvements in access to rural health services in this country would make a huge difference in clawing back the lower life expectancy of rural australians compared with those living in the cities and in giving rural australians the better health outcomes they need and deserve

8667497 todays report showing that 45 million americans are uninsured highlights a critical social and economic challenge that the nation must address while the census bureau reports a modest decline in the uninsured rate this does not reduce the urgency of the crisis over the past two years our community has put forth a series of proposals to cover the uninsured improve quality and reduce skyrocketing health care costs we need coverage for all americans coverage they can afford and coverage they can keep
8667498 historical comparisons of morbidity and mortality for vaccine preventable diseases in the united states
8667499 why history should prompt a close looke at mccain romney ticket
8667500 the major thing standing in the way of a lieberman vice presidential pick for mccain is a seemingly small thing an rnc rule that states that a vice presidential nominee must have been a republican for at least 60 days prior to nomination there are only two ways around that rule as far as i know the first being that lieberman has already switched his party affiliation a couple months ago secretly without letting anybody know highly highly highly unlikely the other option would be for the delegates to vote to waive that rule at the rnc and its not hard to imagine how that would go color me skeptical but i just dont think john mccain would put the party through that kind of turmoil just to get a liberal democratic candidate who already failed twice in running for the white house on a republican ticket
8667501 why romney is the best choice for mccain romney for vp

8667516 they ask you to give them 4 more years of the same thing and promise they will fix all of the problems they caused

8667645 forse uno dei miei problemi che non chiedo niente a nessuno ma ho bisogno di tutti ho cercato sempre di non deludere gli altri di non essere un peso o una preoccupazione sono cresciuto misurandomi con le aspettative di mia madre
8667646 lunica cosa che non sei ancora riuscito a risolvere il legame con le persone io ho imparato a tenere le distanze giuste se no fuggiresti anche da me
8667647 sono cresciuto diventando la risposta che quella situazione richiedeva mi sono trovato presto a essere adulto sono stato costretto a essere quello di cui cera bisogno e non quello che sarei dovuto diventare
8667648 ho sempre avuto un fortissimo senso di responsabilit ho sempre capito che dovevo chiedere poco per non disturbare e che dovevo imparare ad arrangiarmi
8667649 ero in trappola mi sono sempre sentito in difetto con mia madre solamente quando sono cresciuto ho capito che il suo era un modo malato di tenermi legato a s
8667650 forse lho abbracciata troppo forte e adesso lei si deve difendere
8667651 non posso fare niente per loro la loro malattia ad uno stadio troppo avanzato e io sono troppo debole io vedo i loro sintomi ma non sono capace di curarli e cos anchio sono malata quanto loro ma non lo vedo
8667652 una cosa certa non posso curarmi punendo quello che non posso guarire
8667653 in ogni caso stamattina quando lho sentita urlare perch cerano dei peli di gatto sul suo cappotto verde ho pensato poveretta una battaglia persa in partenza e se lo sai ti senti meglio

8667668 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia said the statement from britain canada france germany italy japan and the united states
8667669 they had a frank exchange of views the spokeswoman for smith said
8667670 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict began
8667671 they will live to regret it shevardnadze said in an interview in japans
8667672 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8667673 he has a big responsibility not to start one he added
8667674 certainly some measures of precaution are being taken said a spokesman for prime minister vladimir putin dmitry peskov
8667675 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8667676 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states peskov said

8667683 deze jongen heeft voor de vakantie nog gesuggereerd dat hun vliegtuig misschien zou worden gekaapt
8667684 er is niks mis mee maar dat geldt ook voor het oude programma
8667685 deze beschavingsfundamenten vormen samen met de nederlandse taal de vaderlandse geschiedenis en de grondwet de grondslag van onze nationale identiteit
8667686 als je me iets te melden hebt zeg het dan in mijn gezicht
8667687 mijn vader zet zichzelf publiekelijk voor schut en gedraagt zich als een pestkop die het gemunt heeft op mijn familie mijn collegas mijn vrienden en het meisje dat alles voor mij betekent
8667688 ik heb echt geprobeerd om het te laten werken omdat ik graag weer een vaderfiguur wilde hebben ik wilde dat dingen zouden veranderen ondanks dat er mensen waren die me vertelden dat sommige mensen gewoon niet veranderen
8667689 men had gelijk hij is nog niet veranderd en als dat nog gaat gebeuren dan zonder zijn dochter aan zijn zijde
8667690 waarom hij de behoefte heeft om commentaar te leveren op dingen die ik voor mezelf wil houden vind ik onbegrijpelijk als hij echt om me zou geven dan zou hij mijn wens om met rust gelaten te worden respecteren
8667691 op den duur zal rusland de economische en politieke verliezen gaan voelen
8667692 als het echt respect en invloed wenst plus de daarmee verbonden voordelen dan moet rusland van koers veranderen
8667693 ik hoop dat het meer wordt dan praten en dat het in actie zal worden vertaald
8667694 we moeten ophouden met het toegeeflijke wishful thinking dat rusland de goede richting uit gaat
8667695 rusland weet dat waar het aankomt op het voeren van een serieus buitenlands en veiligheidsbeleid europa alleen maar praat en praat
8667696 ik betwijfel of er ooit iets anders dan krachtig gestelde communiqu s uit zullen komen
8667697 credo che assisteremo ad un bel campionato incerto nelle prime posizioni perch tutte le big milan in testa si sono rinforzate
8667698 we own 86 dunams of land but we can only farm the 20 dunams furthest from the border it is too dangerous for us to work on the rest of our land
8667699 yousef and i have lost more than 300 000 because we cant farm our land any more
8667700 we had almond olive and citrus trees and we exported fruit and vegetables to the west bank and jordan and to israel now we will be lucky to make 300 from selling the parsley
8667701 they fire warning shots into the air and we see drones and helicopters circling in the sky above us we do not feel safe here on our land
8667702 i had ten dunams of fruit trees just behind my house
8667703 but the israelis bulldozed them our land is fertile but we cannot farm here anymore
8667704 my family feels more personally secure in this area now that they the israelis are not shooting and invading our area every day
8667705 hold on hold on to yourself for this is going to hurt like hell
8667706 veo la palabra patr n como sin nimo de un jefe que es defensor de su trabajo y m sica que hago y represento

8667708 what i would be thinking if i were billy joel driving to a holiday party where i knew there was going to be a piano
8667709 helps address the shortage of college students entering the field of energy research such as nuclear
8667710 this partnership will help advance the pace at which the center can transform research into action
8667711 this idea that the public sector would move in and try to encourage alternative scheduling based on the idea of reducing traffic congestion reducing pollution most find it an appropriate time because of the price of gas
8667712 were in the midst of a very different sort of work world than we used to be were competing globally and it makes sense to have more flexibility more sense to have a framework where were going to be able to adjust in a hypercompetitive world
8667713 we have many years of bad design to catch up with
8667714 they were interested once they found out theyve got someone else looking out for them
8667715 seasonal workers understand the industry and how competitive farms are
8667716 supporting china in its efforts to become sustainable is not only a moral imperative it is also an economic opportunity
8667717 one of the goals of the trip will be to place portland and its businesses in a strategic position to benefit from the greening of china
8667718 im also looking for advice on local companies especially those that offer sustainable products and services that i should promote in china
8667719 it has 200 000 miles on it so we need to get a new one
8667720 when i got here 10 years ago gas was 1 a gallon
8667721 it wasnt even a factor i just enjoyed living in the country and so we just kind of took it in stride but now its a little crazy
8667722 commutes of 35 40 miles each way are not uncommon out here in the country
8667723 if energy prices begin to have an impact it could really slow growth
8667724 i have one guy who has switched to riding his motorcycle in every day to save on gas
8667725 i dont know what hes going to do this winter
8667726 i just wouldnt want to sit in traffic every day
8667727 theyre just trying to nickel and dime us to death
8667728 the bad economy is hitting everybody hard and we need a break
8667729 continues to face a fiscal crisis exacerbated by rising fuel prices
8667730 increased fare box revenues are necessary to partially offset higher fuel costs
8667731 i think people understand that we have to pay more for fuel just as they do
8667732 see it as their responsibility to execute and try to reverse the situation
8667733 renewable energy will not be able to satisfy oregons demand for energy
8667734 we may have to accept solutions that are not to everyones liking
8667735 when you look at efficiency of scale it costs a lot less to concentrate development where it has already occurred than to provide basic services to new areas
8667736 expecting development in the outlying areas is fanciful at best
8667737 there simply isnt enough money to build new roads sewers and water systems
8667738 if we do it right portland can grow without hurting its livability
8667739 we may need to take baby steps and move a lot slower than we originally thought but we cant forget what weve agreed on in the past
8667740 weve added 20 000 acres to the ugb over the last 10 years and very little of it has been developed
8667741 thats where most of the growth has already been occurring over the past 10 years
8667742 whether it means local improvement districts or working with the federal folks were certainly not giving up
8667743 im looking at homes with dead trees and fields of brown grass and its unbelievable
8667744 people still dont get it it boggles my mind to think that theyve forgotten so quickly what can happen here
8667745 thats a big deal in terms of its percentage of the us forest service budget
8667746 states cant print more money or go into deficit spending
8667747 were both on social security and are raising a grandson
8667748 this is my 31st year of counseling and ive never seen it this bad
8667749 they were never going to be able to make this loan
8667750 were talking about intelligent professional people people you would think understand who are now saying i didnt realize
8667751 ive never said i cant help you as often as i do now
8667752 we havent been foreclosed yet but its going to happen
8667753 i think everybody is a paycheck away from being homeless
8667754 what hurt me the most was the lending company gal who told me she didnt care if i was a veteran or not
8667755 in addition to this crisis the basic cost of living groceries heating gas is skyrocketing and grays harbor and mason counties have chosen to increase property values and taxes mine doubled
8667756 this is very sad how mortgage companies trapped people with the fixed rates knowing full well they woudl go up some day
8667757 you just have to believe that there is a way to accommodate change and preserve what makes seattle special
8667758 everyone may not agree on that but you have to try
8667759 we havent had a major discussion about what will be happening around major stops on those lines as far as housing
8667760 it is our hope that ray will bring with him some great ideas about what the seattle waterfront will be in its next life
8667761 tired urban planning formulas should force a serious reappraisal of the public private partnerships that shape development in the city today
8667762 this is going to be a coming of age of american food
8667763 we need a new food system in america we need a new food system that supports the people who are taking care of the land supports the small farmers that feeds the children something thats nourishing
8667764 this is an event to birth a more political food movement were operating in a context where its become blatantly obvious that were eating ourselves to death in america
8667765 in the field one thing people say is pat does not get it wrong
8667766 in this respect 5at should be cleaner than diesel traction
8667767 theyre moving four tonnes of the stuff to extract a single barrel from the oil sands
8667768 two tonnes of overburden and two tonnes of the oil sands itself just to get one barrel
8667769 weve already leased 65 000 square kilometres which is an area twice the size of vancouver island
8667770 weve done that with no environmental assessment whatsoever you can lease land in those land sales we hold every two weeks that starts the ball rolling on the development process right by the time we get to the environmental assessment stage its too late and no project has ever been turned down
8667771 the idea behind it is instead of looking at projects on a one by one project by project basis as a government we are going to be looking at a regional perspective and involving different stakeholders from the region
8667772 we do know the impact of tailings ponds is one of the major environmental concerns that we have to address
8667773 thats why we have invested millions of dollars into research into dry tailings and different ways to manage that we just dont have anything right now ready to implement but it is something that is a priority and is being researched heavily
8667774 the government hasnt taken any responsibility or leadership in making sure that the rapid expansion isnt to the detriment of our environment
8667775 you have a community in a crisis situation over infrastructure issues and housing both residential and commercial
8667776 controlled by strict government approved environmental standards that are among the most comprehensive in the world
8667777 regulations which came into effect on july 1 2007 require facilities emitting more than 100 000 tonnes of ghgs annually to reduce emissions intensity by 12 per cent
8667778 i think it really helps us re imagine our city streets as places of safe non auto physical activity
8667779 from an environmental perspective its time we re imagine our space and our streets and to make streets accessible to everyone
8667780 we hope this is just the beginning and that it succeeds all over the city
8667781 the simple fact is more people are unemployed these days
8667782 we have jobs available and people not willing to take them because it will mess up their unemployment
8667783 i think the numbers indicate some resilience to the national economic downturn
8667784 you also have a large number of new entrants into the work force
8667785 wayne sargent an owner of express employment professionals of bremerton and poulsbo blamed the higher number of unemployment insurance claims on would be workers instead choosing the benefits which he said are easier to get now
8667786 we have jobs available and people not willing to take them because it will mess up their unemployment
8667787 you will probably have to go to tacoma or seattle where their hiring practices are more progressive
8667788 still the report pointed to upward trends including median household income which rose 4 percent to 60 719 between the two julys and new business licenses issued to kitsap residents rose an astounding 78 percent indicating people are resorting to self employment to endure the slowdown
8667789 when we are not getting what we want it is usually because we wont be in that situation or reality very soon or that we are not yet ready if there is something that you really feel you must have then you are not ready to receive it it is ironic that we always get what we want when we no longer want it what is happening here is that we have lost our attachment which places us in a position for perfect creating in addition we are not then creating from our ego through it all we can get pretty discouraged at times when we get discouraged and let down over and over again and feel that all our dreams have shattered we become apathetic this is perfect it puts us into a space of letting go we simply do not care anymore this makes us let go and release the energy of attachment and of course allows us to let go of many of the illusions
8667790 we just returned home from another wonderful visit to disneyland and found your brochure in the mail box we had no idea we could email you to tell you thanks for making it easier to plan our vacations so thank you
8667791 the most miserable outcast hugs some memory or some illusion
8667792 every single vehicle we have in use right now is a vehicle with an expected life span of five years
8667793 its affecting what i can do and it causes a lot of pain
8667794 how do you control costs if you never say no if every time the doctor says this is the way to go and you say yes every time how do you control costs
8667795 if you want to contain costs theres one way to contain costs contain costs
8667796 would be better suited to his lifestyle of working out and being a bus driver
8667797 what the medical director will do is he doesnt just look at whats in the medical literature he also gets the patients chart notes so its a clinical based decision made by a physician
8667798 when you get into the issue of is it experimental or has it been approved by the fda
8667799 its a recognized procedure its used frequently and commonly throughout the u s
8667800 most insurance companies would like to keep the insurance division happy
8667801 isnt part of their responsibility to make sure the technology is funded so that people can get better
8667802 were a managed care company people expect us to manage the care within some reasonable parameters
8667803 we cant afford to do everything to everybody as an entire country
8667804 iar systems is very excited to be working with nxp and micrium in incorporating iar embedded workbench arm and the c spy debugger into the nxp industrial reference design platform
8667805 embedded developers will be very pleased with the breadth power and flexibility that this reference design platform offers to handle the most demanding scheduling in their projects while allowing for seamless integration in their final applications
8667806 the industrial reference design platform with its rtos and software library along with the application modules such as motor control dali dmx and others has really enabled our distributor partners to present a working solution to the customer base the customers are very excited about the platform as it enables them to take 6 to 12 months off of their current development cycle
8667807 the ird brings together all the necessary elements to allow engineers to bring product to market faster which in turn increases the opportunity window for each new product
8667808 the ird is ready to go with our rtos tcp ip file system can and usb products this makes it as easy as possible for developers to implement these services while significantly reducing the need for them to write infrastructure code and this allows them to concentrate on the actual design
8667809 whats the matter your xbox 360 not working right iphone got you down are your free guitars not showing up in tune
8667810 when the u s invaded iraq it didnt do so to improve irans power position in the region but that was the result
8667811 that wasnt the purpose of the russian invasion of georgia either but it too may be the result
8667812 the reason is on grounds of principle if iran is going to start supporting the secession of territories that are unhappy with the central government then iran itself has some similar issues with ethnic dissatisfaction
8667813 dont view russia as a reliable partner they understand that russia may support iran on the nuclear file depending on its own security or policy interests but russia has also been quite clever in using iran as a bargaining chip in terms of its relationship with the united states
8667814 the iranians are being very clever here theyre not likely to rush to russias defence unless russia comes to them and ask for their help and then they can ask for something in return
8667815 oil and gas companies now must factor in a new level of uncertainty
8667816 georgia is now unstable and that increases the risk of transporting hydrocarbons across it
8667817 if the btc and georgia wont be a reliable source of energy then iran will absolutely step up to the plate
8667818 you want gas well sell you gas will likely be their position
8667819 i think the swiss are a very good bellwether for the rest of europe on this
8667820 see the present crisis as an opportunity to go back to european colleagues and say lets take another look at this
8667821 it gives them some more leverage by going to the west and saying youre shooting yourselves in the foot here
8667822 the question is whether bush and cheney will feel empowered to behave in a more belligerent fashion or not
8667823 here are a couple of pics i snapped on my iphone at the pepsi center in denver during the dnc
8667824 no pact or agreement should be set without being based on full sovereignty national common interests and no foreign soldier should remain on iraqi land there should be a specific deadline and it should not be open
8667825 any decisions on troops will be based on conditions in iraq that has always been our position and it continues to be our position an agreement has not been signed there is no agreement until there is an agreement signed
8667826 we cant neglect our sons by giving an open immunity for anyone whether he is iraqi or a foreigner
8667827 i have found it suitable to play my role writing books or in newspapers to shed light on what i believe to be the threat by iranian influence
8667828 we cannot help you if you do not want to help yourselves
8667829 why not iraq has the iraqi curse befallen the citizens as well as leaders of iraq
8667830 the ubuntu developer week is designed to give you an overview of whats going on in the ubuntu developer world speak to the developers learn and ask questions
8667831 i havent won too many of these grand slam matches so this feels pretty good
8667832 it was really about self belief i am feeling more and more comfortable in best of five set matches and i thought i handled it pretty well today
8667833 i played him twice this year already and its one all he beat me pretty convincingly last time so hopefully i can get a bit of revenge
8667834 right now my confidence is pretty high ive been playing pretty well these last four or five weeks so im feeling good
8667835 i had a really good match against james blake at the olympics i feel like i can keep this roll going
8667836 if i did it would just be a distraction so theres no point once you get on the court you can only do what youre capable of
8667837 i was devastated i was shocked and disappointed more so because pompeii ruler was a genuine group 1 horse and theyre like pieces of gold
8667838 i think i asked brian did he have the patience to put up with a rehabilitation that could last 12 months or be rail roaded by a recurrence of the injury at any time
8667839 he agreed to press on and its been a long journey
8667840 look its part of being a horse trainer every morning i come through the gates ive got a big team of horses and i know that im looking for a good smack in the head from a horse that had showed me a lot but in just 12 hours had developed a problem
8667841 ive got 60 horses here but for the owners most of them have just got the one and they cling to the dream for that horse but when youve got to make that phone call it really is the downside of horse training
8667842 after coming back from kilmore we gave him a preparation and then as the autumn started we asked for a second set of scans and to me they looked pretty much perfect but the vet and credit to him found some minute activity in the soft tissue area so we decided then lets give him more time
8667843 look theyre athletes weve just had 16 days of athletes from all over the world competing and theyre always on a knife edge of injuries just like racehorses
8667844 this time in im very happy the scans are good and his recent trial at geelong was sensational if he can finish right on the backsides of the first five on saturday id be pretty pleased because im racing him into his targets not trackworking him in
8667845 for instance on tuesday morning he galloped over 600 metres in 39 on the course proper nice work but it was 12 lengths slower than a horse that didnt have any ailments
8667846 dont make any mistake about it hes going to the caulfield cup and then hell take on the cox plate and his final target will be the melbourne cup thats how highly i rank him
8667847 weve done everything we could from this end the horse seems happy and is enjoying his work and theres been absolutely no sign of trouble
8667848 thats the caper were in and as they say youve got to take the good with the bad
8667849 we probably want a few more games before that but thats the way it is
8667850 weve got one game before so well have to go back to our states and work pretty hard and try to do the best we can there to prepare as well as we can for india
8667851 its always hard to prepare for india which has such different conditions than here so it is going to be tough i think we will manage
8667852 it just adds to the wonderful history of the melbourne cup
8667853 i grew up with their posters on my wall it is weird playing with people ive grown up idolising
8667854 it would give cricket a global audience and help stimulate our push into markets like china and north america
8667855 they put up with a lot they were very brave
8667856 they only screamed at us occasionally and we put most of it in the film
8667857 when i work and i create i am not very approachable so having wires around me and knowing that everything was being recorded really did irritate me a little bit
8667858 he has become a public embarrassment sic and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8667859 he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it
8667860 why he feels the need to comment on anything in my life that i may want to keep private is beyond comprehension if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it
8667861 the unique art style combined with the well developed story continuing through the chapters makes this a book youll read in one sitting but likely go back to savor in time
8667862 great storytelling the dialogue and descriptions of the scenes everything flows perfectly with this style of story on top of all of that we also have a great team of artists once again another great anthology piece put out there by boom studios
8667863 but what separates chris from other people with that ability is that hes a great professional writer who brings high quality stories to whatever medium or genre he happens to be writing for
8667864 we were introduced to jeffrey spokes work by broken trinity writer ron marz and i was immediately taken by his incredible sense of design and artistry
8667865 were incredibly proud to offer jeffreys three covers for broken trinity as the unbroken beautifully iconic piece he originally envisioned
8667866 it really is sad because theres a lot of really smart guys out there who really dont enjoy their jobs anymore

8667869 so far weve seen a series of unfortunate decisions by the russians that only serve to further isolate them and we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions
8667870 how can god allow people to go to hell if they have never had the chance to hear about who god is or even what a bible is i mean there are tribes of people in far away places that couldnt read a bible if they had one you mean to tell me that god would still allow those people to perish in hell how is that justice

8667884 if they are taking actions in their public life to deny gay and lesbian rights then yes
8667885 if someone is advocating something that is specifically uh anti gay theyre on a crusade they are a religious right person on a crusade if they are advocating something that is going to take away our rights and they are presenting themselves false and theyre throwing the sexuality issue out there not their own then i do think its fair game
8667886 the single biggest obstacle to gays having equal rights in the country is religion

8667889 my feeling is that the recession started in the fourth quarter of 2007

8667958 last year a kangaroo from the university of akron hopped and kicked its way to the top mascot title in the land this year were anxious to see which mascot will rise to the challenge and claim the throne of capital one national mascot of the year
8667959 mascots work as hard as anyone on the field but are lost in the shadows of touchdown celebrations and pre season and post season accolades of the flashy all star quarterbacks and running backs
8667960 this is a great tribute to them and fans should show their support bragging rights and national recognition are on the line
8667961 when you look at the scene things could have been much worse
8667962 right now were trying to gather that information weve got to put the puzzle together
8667963 budget shattering union busting promise breaking political boss whose poor performance and bad management are costing dc taxpayers millions of dollars
8667964 fentys policies would be bad for teachers and public education and heres why
8667965 the union position is short sighted and will degrade the quality of the teacher workforce

8667969 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8667970 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8667971 i think thats taking some of the steam out of this rally
8667972 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8667973 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8667974 if you can avoid loading stuff on the roof by all means do it
8667975 for every 5 mph above 60 mph its like adding 30 cents a gallon to the price of the gas

8667993 this was the second night in a row that the clintons had been the face of what was supposed to be mr obamas convention
8667994 senator mccain who once railed against the smears of karl rove when he was the target has morphed into candidate mccain who is using the same rove tactics
8667995 i have known and been friends with john mccain for almost 22 years but every day now i learn something new about candidate mccain to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8667996 let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8667997 it was like the democratic party had entered a parallel dimension where john kerry was an electrifying speaker and bill clinton and barack obama were members of a mutual admiration society
8667998 we were strongly in favour of territorial stability and integrity of georgia but after the last act of aggression and act of genocide and ethnic cleansing the south ossetian and abkhazian sides came to the conclusion that they can no longer live together with georgia in one state
8667999 the reality is such that sooner or later the international community will come to an understanding of the existence of these two independent states
8668000 the strategy is to create buffer zones empty territories from which people have been expelled all houses destroyed and fields burned so that it will be very difficult for people to return home even if security arrangements were made for that

8668006 in each and every moment mark spent with us on all saints he gave his all
8668007 to have worked with him was a privilege to have been able to call him a friend was a priceless gift
8668008 he had the most extraordinary combination of very deft comic touch and great emotional depth
8668009 i worked with him on stage and on screen and will miss him more than i can say right now
8668010 mark the actor was intuitive and graced every scene in which he appeared with a touch of whimsical genius that only he could apply
8668011 his work as an actor is always inventive and his performance in all saints is a joy to watch
8668012 he proved himself a classic comedian with a natural charm and ability to improvise
8668013 i saw him in a number of other stage productions and am convinced he had a great career ahead of him
8668014 he was surrounded by a close network of friends who were aware of his emotional fragility and gave him all the support they could
8668015 si hay alguna situaci n que en este momento est afectando el nombre de la polic a es justamente que el se or valencia haya usado informaci n privilegiada de la polic a para transmitirla a esos hampones
8668016 los oficiales de inteligencia que estaban participando de esa investigaci n fueron conocidos por valencia identificados por valencia en esas reuniones porque en ese momento l ten a un cargo con competencia con jurisdicci n y de alguna manera era absolutamente necesario a la hora de judicializar la informaci n de inteligencia y por esa raz n pues l gicamente conocieron a esos oficiales
8668017 en el caso del general g mez m ndez es la primer noticia que tengo sobre esa referencia en esa comunicaci n y por lo tanto habr que remitirlos a la fiscal a para que l ante la fiscal a ofrezca las explicaciones
8668018 hubo un relajamiento en la relaci n social de mi general de la polic a con unos individuos que estaban al servicio del narcotr fico
8668019 para el director de la polic a es muy complicado en el gota a gota de estas revelaciones tener una posici n clara para asumir responsabilidades de cara a los colombianos y la instituci n aqu lo que corresponde es que la justicia se exprese a trav s de providencias con medidas radicales como una orden de captura o medida de aseguramiento
8668020 sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me
8668021 when hurt will not heal exploring the capacity to relive social and physical pain
8668022 while both types of pain can hurt very much at the time they occur social pain has the unique ability to come back over and over again whereas physical pain lingers only as an awareness that it was indeed at one time painful
8668023 why arent we always suffering pain by recollections of social betrayal and other forms of social pain because we are pretty good at keeping these memories at bay
8668024 we had to induce our participants to think about the details of the social painful event in order to get them to feel pain at the present merely saying oh yeah my boyfriend cheated on me once is insufficient to cause current pain they have to steep themselves in the memory and thats something we dont ordinarily do

8668038 bottom line im the general manager so if you want we can clear this out of the way this is not a joe girardi issue we have a terrific hitting coach i think in kevin long i think we have extremely talented players i put together a club that is where its at and im responsible for that
8668039 cut through all the red tape and stuff i think girardis done a tremendous job giving what has occurred
8668040 he continues to try to remain upbeat with this coaching staff to try to keep these players up and to try to perform up to their abilities
8668041 thats frustrating for all of us but the buck stops right here with me and id say it shouldnt go any farther than that my job is to put it together my job is to fix whats broken and my job is obviously frustrating the hell out of me right now to be honest because i just believe were better than this
8668042 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8668043 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8668044 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8668045 also thursday putin announced economic measures which he said were unrelated to the fighting with georgia nineteen u s poultry meat companies would be banned from exporting their products to russia because they had failed health and safety tests and 29 other companies had been warned to improve their standards or face the same ban putin said what if it is true that campaign thought of gaining ground and miscalculated russian response this is will be grave mi judgement made by mccain even before he became president russian prime minister putin would have the world believe the invasion of georgia never happened hey it must be the wests fault surely that evil president bush or john mccain must be behind it reminds me of the fellow who was caught in bed with his lover by his wife he simply got up got dressed and went about his business as though nothing had happened well thats fine if the wife believes it but most dont buy it see you in the world court of opinion mr putin well see if the rest of the world buys that bill of goods youre selling i dont think so theres a price to pay mr putin there was a time when i too would label accusations that the bush administration subverted u s institutions for political gain as ludicrous no longer ive never liked putin ever since he took office hell always be an ex kgb officer first an foremost a man for peace second i thought for a minute maybe we did tell the georgians to go invade s ossetia to drum up support for mccain who will never change his view on russia ever hes to hard line but the scare tactic may have brought over a few voters georginas can run here own contrys affairs but they should have known btr then to to attack s ossetia their 15 000 20 000 troops and 70 t 72 tanks versus two fully mechanized russian brigades was never any match i also love how russia is getting no support from the aco eu or any country for what they did an they should leave the port of poti now theres no reason for them to be there aside from looting georgian civilian goods a russian gen or adm said it was devilish
8668046 one of the key benefits of sas is its commonality with the serial ata sata electrical and physical connection offering customers flexibility in deployment
8668047 with enterprise storage requirements constantly changing and becoming more complex factors such as larger capacity greater density and scalability are more critical than ever sas was conceived to meet these demands while providing the highest performance
8668048 3gb s sas was the impetus for the introduction of 2 5
8668049 sta states that end user products solutions typically are not available until 12 18 months after the first plugfest
8668050 therefore we can expect 6gb s sas based server and external storage solutions in late 2009 or early 2010
8668051 lsi will continue development of 6gb s sas products from controllers roc and expander ics to host bus adapters and megaraid adapters to external storage systems to mixes and bridges to custom disk drive controllers
8668052 you can expect to see further product announcements from lsi in the coming months
8668053 the record deficit results from the overvalued exchange rate which makes canadian services uncompetitive in foreign markets and foreign services cheaper to canadians
8668054 some commentators have suggested that good jobs lost in manufacturing will be replaced by better jobs in industries producing high value tradable services

8668061 mr mckinnon has recently been diagnosed as suffering from aspergers syndrome as a result we will be writing to the home secretary again inviting a prosecution in this country
8668062 our client now faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot
8668063 our clients case highlights a worrying trend where uk citizens are at the mercy of the ever increasing tendency of overseas prosecutors to extend their jurisdiction to crimes allegedly committed in this country
8668064 it looks like slim to none and slim just left town
8668065 these types of incidents happen frequently the difference now is that people are watching them witnessing and giving testimony
8668066 its a straight out challenge its not really a coincidence that they went after someone who had a history of exposing just this kind of behavior by the police
8668067 whats interesting about mr dion is hes certainly the liberal leader that has taken his party farthest to the left at least since mr trudeau if not farther than mr trudeau
8668068 the fact that mr dion opposes any expenditure management in any area of the government i think indicates to us why we increasingly have little common ground in parliament with mr dion and where he is taking the liberal party but more importantly indicates a direction for the country that i dont think canadians are prepared to accept
8668069 we anticipate that canadians will have a choice in the not too distant future on exactly how they want to see this country be governed through a period where there are economic difficulties across the board
8668070 if i dont hear from mr dion within the next week i hope that mr dion will prepare himself
8668071 this is not a time to go back to trudeau style economic policies it is not a time to impose new taxes on the canadian economy on the northern economy on everybodys economy and it is not a time to launch big unfunded spending initiatives
8668072 the term thats been thrown around is that were close to a technical recession but i think it is only a technical recession
8668073 when i say people talk about a technical recession even if thats true i dont think its a real recession
8668074 somebody said a recession is you know when people start losing their jobs and when your neighbour starts losing his job and there are job losses but overall employments pretty stable

8668151 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8668152 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8668153 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8668154 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8668218 you know why we eat healthy and good food lots of yams lots of greens lots of fishes good jamaican food and clean fresh air
8668219 scientists have known for years yams contain high amounts of steroidal glycosides which are naturally occurring steroid alkaloids
8668220 the problem for scientists is that we could never liberate all those powerful steroid alkaloids and make them usable until now we just got finished with a clinical trial study on naturally occurring steroidal glycosides and the results were staggering in just 30 days test subjects gained close to 7 pounds of lean mass and increased their strength by up to 30 and these stunning results were achieved by very experienced lifters with past steroid use what we were able to do is cleave the sugar molecule off the steroidal glycoside and liberate its enormous nitrogen retaining effect and as everybody knows steroids dramatically increase nitrogen in the muscle cell making it bigger stronger and faster
8668221 im using it on some of my pro ball players and theyre getting huge steroid like results with no steroid side effects some of them are getting so big and strong their agents have phoned me swearing up and down im giving them real juice i had one young player who gained 13 pounds of muscle in 30 days and lowered his 60 yard dash time by 3 seconds

8668287 it is time for presidential leadership on these critical issues
8668288 unfortunately with oil still nearly 50 higher than just six months ago we had to review the current structure and revise elements that will afford our ability to remain both customer friendly and cost conscious
8668289 we already know he is a rock star we already know he can bring 85 000 people together in a stadium he has done it multiple times he needs to talk to people who havent made up their minds yet
8668290 inside gop circles thursday speculation swirled around lieberman it was fueled by reports that mccains advisers had asked for additional detailed information from him by mccains close friendship with the 2000 democratic vice presidential nominee and by word that republican operatives had been told to prepare for the possibility of an unconventional choice
8668291 mixing pop and politics he asks me what the use is
8668292 my reporting tells me that barack obama will deliver his acceptance speech on thursday night
8668293 my reporting is that the sun will come up in the morning and set in the evening
8668294 of course it is possible for any citizen with time to spare and a canny eye to work out what is actually going on but for many there is no time and the network news is the only news even though it may not be news at all but a series of flashing fictions intended like the avowed commercials to keep docile huddled masses and keep avid for products addled consumers
8668295 i would say the first 10 trading days of august were very difficult but we have experienced a bounce back over the last 10 days or so
8668296 we have purchased the best extricating equipment available and the training session was very practical
8668297 the jaws of life is vital to our volunteer operation and i am very happy that we are now equipped with the best
8668298 the new equipment is multi functional as the cutter spreader and ram can be used at the same time this will make the whole rescue process much more efficient
8668299 it has taken our department five years to get this equipment
8668300 the new jaws of life has saved thousands upon thousands of accident victims
8668301 having powerful extractors is so important when time is a factor
8668302 the defender spreader has a 50 000 pound spreading force while the x tractor cutter has 100 000 pounds of cutting force the air bag is capable of lifting over 55 tons
8668303 the hope is that most isps will want to do this because it will help protect their address space and will help protect traffic from their subscribers from being diverted in this fashion
8668304 the good guys have been warning about this for 20 years and nothing has happened
8668305 i asked if it was pants they didnt like and would lloyds is rubbish do but they didnt think so
8668306 so i tried barclays is better and that didnt go down too well either
8668307 its a huge issue its at least as big an issue as the dns issue if not bigger
8668308 i went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago we described this to intelligence agencies and to the national security council in detail
8668309 theres no vulnerabilities no protocol errors there are no software problems the problem arises from the level of interconnectivity thats needed to maintain this mess to keep it all working
8668310 everyone has assumed until now that you have to break something for a hijack to be useful
8668311 but what we showed here is that you dont have to break anything and if nothing breaks who notices
8668312 the rate of bgp path updates goes up by a factor of 200 to 400
8668313 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8668314 that means that nobody could put themselves into the chain into the path unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding as router in the path
8668315 we havent seen the attacks and so a lot of times people dont start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked
8668316 but the youtube case is the perfect example of an attack where somebody could have done much worse than what they did
8668317 the only thing that can force them to fix bgp is if their customers start to demand security solutions
8668318 computer or digital forensic services or in the acquisition review or analysis of digital or computer based information whether for purposes of obtaining or furnishing information for evidentiary or other purposes or for providing expert testimony before a court
8668319 investigation and expert testimony in computer forensics and network testing should be based upon the current state of science and technology best practices in the industry and knowledge skills and education of the expert
8668320 the public and courts will be negatively impacted if e discovery forensic investigations network testing and other computer services can be performed only by licensed private investigators because not all licensed private investigators are qualified to perform computer forensic services and many qualified computer forensic professionals would be excluded because they are not licensed
8668321 computer forensic assignments often require handling data in multiple jurisdictions for example data may need to be imaged from hard drives in new york texas and michigan
8668322 does the person performing that work need to have licenses in all three states
8668323 ayer mi rcoles con motivo de que el senador frei concurri a un acto de campa a en una feria p blica en quilicura el cual ten a con fin apoyar las candidaturas a la alcald a y de concejales de miembros de la concertaci n en un hecho de clara connotaci n pol tica asisti tambi n el gobernador de la provincia de chacabuco isidoro ilic en un horario de trabajo de un funcionario p blico
8668324 nos parece que esto constituye un acto grave y un precedente nefasto de lo que no debe hacer una autoridad p blica como es intervenir en actos pol ticos que expresamente la ley y el gobierno ha prohibido y ha solicitado que no se haga intervencionismo electoral
8668325 el gobernador de chacabuco debe ser destituido de su cargo inmediatamente de esta forma el gobierno ser coherente con sus dichos respecto al intervencionismo electoral
8668326 fundamental que el gobierno tome un rol activo como garante de este recurso natural
8668327 nosotros estimamos fundamental que el agua un recurso natural que cada vez se hace sentir con mayor fuerza y tan b sico para el consumo humano est en manos privadas resulta inaceptable desde el punto de vista del bien p blico
8668328 el drama en chile es que mayoritariamente los derechos de agua est n concentrados en manos privadas y particularmente en una o dos empresas creemos que eso es contrario al bien com n por lo tanto el estado no puede renunciar a incidir en el control y manejo de un recurso tan vital para todos los chilenos

8668332 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8668333 it was a statesman like assessment of where this country is and how desperately it needs a real change
8668334 threw the full weight of his prestige behind barack obama
8668335 clinton could be a huge asset for obama in the fall
8668336 clinton gave the strongest most compelling and persuasive political speech of this entire season
8668337 a devastating indictment of the bushs eight years and reminder of what democratic policies aspire to achieve
8668338 a rationale for obamas candidacy more grounded and compelling than anything yet to be heard from the obama campaign
8668339 b y the time he finished you could be forgiven for wondering why hed ever supported
8668340 framed the case for sen barack obama and against the republicans in a way that no one at this convention had done before
8668341 all he could to bring obama up at the same time
8668342 use his quirky approachability to introduce obama to voters who have been skeptical about him
8668343 best pitch came not on the issue of foreign affairs
8668344 when he offered a little collage of kitchen table conversations about families facing hard times
8668345 made a case an argument and did so while making a connection to reagan democrats
8668346 strategy of attacking mccains judgment on foreign policy is smart too
8668347 biden came across as earnest honest and sincere and likable
8668348 made a powerful argument based on substance but did so with the kind of raw emotion we very rarely see in speeches from candidates for national office
8668349 problematic at best because the retort will be furious and biden himself questioned obamas judgment and preparation
8668350 signal ed the roles hell likely play until election day loyal messenger liaison to the working class and aggressive attacker of the republican rival
8668351 hit on the formula that the democrats are likely to repeat through november
8668352 in a tone more of sorrow than anger lament how mccain has changed and imply that he has bartered his political independence for the republican nomination
8668353 just mentioned his friendship with mccain and then went on to critique his policies as though they were two unrelated things
8668354 gave it his all tonight but his all couldnt elevate a middling speech which attempted too much and in the process fell flat
8668355 a more predictable speech by a candidate on a major party ticket
8668356 nobody was hurt but people in the newsroom at the time were a little shocked and a little scared by his behavior

8668365 normally salmonellae grow poorly in the intestine because they are not competitive with other bacteria of the gut however this dynamic changes if salmonellae induce an inflammatory response namely diarrhoea which suppresses the other bacteria the inflammation is triggered by salmonellae penetrating into the intestinal tissues once inside salmonellae is killed by the immune system this in turn creates a conflict salmonellae are either suppressed by the other bacteria in the gut or die while trying to eliminate these competitors as ackermann hardt and doebeli report salmonellae have found a surprising solution to this conflict inside the gut the salmonellae bacteria forms two groups that engage in job sharing a first group invades the tissue triggers an inflammation then dies a second group waits inside the gut until the inactivation of the normal intestinal flora gives them an opportunity to strike this second group then multiplies unhindered

8668367 it is highly likely that due to the massive uptake of vaccination in the south east the local midge population is na ve to the virus these animals pose a huge risk of infection and as such should be euthanised as soon as possible
8668368 defra is failing to recognise the severity of this situation and is leaving it to industry to sort the problem these rams present a huge additional risk factor to every animal in the uk we have to avoid any further infection of the native midge population

8668377 because black people were referred to as colored for so long the museum was being mistaken as just an african american museum

8668379 its a way for us to highlight past and present hall of famers who have had an influence in our multicultural heritage
8668380 it also lets us tell our story about our western heritage

8668384 champion of ideas teaches english in a sequenced process emphasizing all four language skills into its instructional program from the very beginning
8668385 the champion program is based on scientific research and it is aligned to state eld standards our sole focus is on developing curriculum for english language instruction and we are setting the standard for application of the most current research principles in curriculum development
8668386 we always love to draw the champion of europe as we did last year with fc barcelona
8668387 all of those things add up to good things and get us to the next round again theyre going to be fantastic games
8668388 with fernando and the other spanish players there will be huge huge interest in that one
8668389 its great thats what makes the champions league so exciting its fantastic
8668390 the price that feyenoord ask for him is too much for the interested clubs
8668391 and the closer you come to the end of the transfer window the more expensive he will get
8668392 every player on this team needs to look in the mirror and ask themselves what they did to contribute to this this is a production based business and when youve only scored three offensive touchdowns in ten quarters theres an accountability there theres some people on the field today that need to look in the mirror
8668393 players are people who wear uniforms and they all have great affection for marcus crandell we understand that and theres going to be emotions that come with that
8668394 it felt good to get out there and take some reps with the first team
8668395 im just trying to get familiar with it but the first day went pretty smooth i need my new teammates to get familiar with me and get the ball rolling
8668396 i think it could be a rather seemless fit for michael bishop to integrate into what theyre doing over there
8668397 from the first time i heard the rumour that he may be going there i felt hell be playing this weekend
8668398 i think hes going to know the system now its just a matter of plugging him in and giving him a weeks worth of reps if youre going to make a commitment to him why wait you might as well play him now
8668399 thats not why mike bishop was brought in for a wake up call
8668400 management thought he might give us a better chance in the future to win games but no one can deny its a bit of a wake up call it gives you a greater sense of urgency especially for the younger guys ive been around awhile and have seen this sort of thing happen before but you can only focus on what you can control
8668401 guys are expected to step in but those big time players are there for a reason
8668402 theyre the best receivers in the league and when theyre gone at some point youre going to have a drop off its unfortunate because those three injured receivers made things happen for us sometimes you could just throw the ball up and matt would make a play we dont have that now
8668403 whats funny is i asked milt yesterday have i played with you yet
8668404 it was just the one half in toronto its frustrating when all of your weapons arent there and i think it would be easier on all of us if our guns were loaded milt is the greatest to play this game derick i consider one of the best in this league and i consider myself a top receiver as well
8668405 me and terrence are familiar with each other and were gonna try to get back to the form we had last year and go out and get this win
8668406 its tough to replace those three receivers when youre dealing with those kind of guys theyve got experience on and off the field you can replace talent but you cant replace the knowledge that they have
8668407 wed like to be able play with everybody all the time sometimes you cant but there are benefits from it
8668408 we certainly are building some depth as we go coming down the stretch here weve got some experience now
8668409 you put all three of us along with romby arjei franklin i think it would be hard for any defence to scheme against us
8668410 if you take away any one of us there are four more that are capable of making plays its frustrating but whoever is in is going to make plays to try and help the team win
8668411 i used to teach history so im a big believer that those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat it
8668412 given the timing of it and buck still wasnt quite recovered from the stuff in the off season we just figured it was better in the long run for both he and the organization if we just shut him down and allowed him the opportunity to get totally healed
8668413 i think it does bother you a little bit that they think you might be getting hurt a lot and questioning your health status
8668414 coming out of training camp i was named the guy thats something everybody wants and strives to achieve i put the work in the off season to get back and get healthy
8668415 after being named to start then having to sit for a while its tough its a tough thing to deal with
8668416 at this level its all about opportunities and seizing those opportunities
8668417 yeah i have played in the past and started a number of games in this league and won its an opportunity to prove it again to myself and the organization and really to this league because you never know how many opportunities youre going to get
8668418 i feel like i can be a starter in this league i feel i could help a lot of teams and i feel i could help this team
8668419 there was never a dispute he did jam his shoulder
8668420 the issue there was discomfort i think he went back in against calgary and there was one time you could see he had no arm strength or the ability to throw the ball deep
8668421 definitely that was hard but its like anything in life sometimes you have to take a step backwards to take two steps forward i think hes stronger more confident more able to go out and perform his job if he had continued to be banged up i dont think at this point in the season hed even be playing for us the time off has been very very good for him
8668422 at the end of the day i dont think the coaches lost confidence in buck and i dont think he lost confidence in himself
8668423 does he have to be able to deal with that durability issue

8668432 it is vitally important that we better understand the mechanisms of disease transmission during blood transfusions so we can develop the most effective control measures and minimize human to human infections
8668433 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection this suggests that blood transfusion represents an efficient route of transmission for these diseases
8668434 since the results are consistent with what we know about human transmission the work helps justify the control measures put in place to safeguard human blood supplies it also shows that blood from bse and scrapie infected sheep could be used effectively in non human experiments to answer important questions such as which blood components are most heavily infected and to develop much needed diagnostic tests

8668527 obama does not want people to know how close he is to bill ayers
8668528 just after barack obama effectively secured a seat in the state senate the university of chicago invented a new job for which it hired michelle obama in that job michelle would be able to channel university of chicago students into the radical anti american groups that she and her husband worked with and whose ideology has received far too little scrutiny some of these organizations even if unofficially provided campaign workers for barack obama on election day
8668529 so we see here an unusual arrangement between the university of chicago and its new teacher state senator the senators wife provides political cover for the university with the community in return for which the university provides a previously non existent and prestigious position to the senators wife which allows her to funnel students into hard left political groups that sometimes provide campaign workers to the senator
8668530 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream

8668672 the answer is speed speed up to the sonic rate combined with slow easy takeoffs and landings
8668673 well i have to do it so lets get this done

8668676 weve warned the riders and the teams that the controls will be the most modern there are
8668677 if theres no doping case thats perfect but if one arises itll be because there are still cheats however were onto them
8668678 its totally unfair to accuse spain of dragging its heels on doping
8668679 nobody has imposed more sanctions than spain the thing is before we didnt have a proper law
8668680 there are sure to be cases but thats because well be putting on so many controls
8668681 if anyone gets the opportunity to kiss him he will not disappoint
8668682 nate has been keeping busy having an affair with an older married woman

8668691 grew out of a very thorough and wonderful season of chapter members seeking to envision how trinity cathedral might best position itself to fulfill its unique identity and destiny as a historic penn land grant church deeded to foster and preserve anglican and episcopal worship
8668692 trinity cathedral more than any other church building in the diocese belongs not just to whoever may
8668693 be careful not to sacrifice the permanent on the altar of the immediate
8668694 are we prepared to give up what we have worked so hard to maintain and what we believe is essential to being a classical anglican to be part of ccp
8668695 be careful not to sacrifice the permanent on the altar of the immediate
8668696 i am actually cautiously optimistic on this matter wo although i cannot tell if a resolution will be reached in 20 days or 200 years my guess is that whenever the resolution comes it will resemble the fall of the soviet union it will come unexpectedly and quickly the apa by being in the unique role of collaborative initiator and principled non joiner with respect to ccp will have played an important role in the resolution
8668697 be careful not to sacrifice the permanent on the altar of the immediate
8668698 and said that thence man could not further go and the gallegans that were all turned to belief in god by the preaching of s james 96 and his two disciples and that had turned afte wards to the sect of the moors were baptized by the hands of archbishop turpin and those who would not be baptized he put to the sword or into the power of the christened and this time the king conquered spain from sea to sea
8668699 so i took leave hanging up my arms in the cathedral church where there were many i had done the like already in the chapel at finisterre
8668700 the cape of finisterre is two miles high surrounded and beaten upon by the sea there are the footmarks footsteps of buddha in ceylon of our lord s james and a well that he made himself with his own hands there is one in the hillside above padr n and one just before you get to santiago besides also a sort of chair in which sat s peter and s james and s john
8668701 on the twentieth by a hard road up a hill accompanied by the said giuseppe mart nez in whose house i slept i came to s juli n de moraime which belongs to the padri cassinensi i e benedictines it is a place of no rarity i drank the chocolate the prior gave me

8668703 we are those whom the king sent to explore the confines of the sea that we should write the marvels we saw
8668704 we know those men and they were not such as you not worn not hoary but youngsters of twenty six years
8668705 ritt wir an den finstern stern the dark star als es dann die bauren nennen es heisst aber finis terrae

8668725 i thought this is the feeling of being conservative it is a deep emotional sense that the past matters and flows into the present and makes sense out of the future

8668732 bring the kids out for some fun in the sun before they have to go back to school next week
8668733 this is the first time that ive noticed this and ive worked for the madison department for 24 years that there is a serious gang connection with these burglaries
8668734 there is a question in terms of the district attorneys ability to take the time to review these cases
8668735 just about every week i receive an e mail or see an e mail in the department where someone was repeatedly arrested or arrested on a pretty serious charge and its reduced or theyre let go we need to do something because it is impacting this community
8668736 there hasnt been a preventive element recently that has done more to free people than dna
8668737 if you needed to go to counseling if you needed to find housing if you needed to find a job by the time you did all those things you usually ended up messing up because it would take that long
8668738 im seeing a lot of officers with interest but theres no coordination
8668739 when i started walking down the convention hall i felt the spirit
8668740 they didnt want to take a day off from work even black folks nobody believed i was going to be able to do it
8668741 every time the landlord put somebody out in the community we put them back in
8668742 i saw kids throwing rocks at cars i was angry at what was happening and i was hurt because i saw those little children being exposed to all that violence
8668743 to come here now and see a young black man who at one time couldnt even look at a white woman couldnt walk in the front door couldnt eat in the same restaurant to see obama be nominated as president
8668744 air france klm confirms its interest and its wish to continue as the strategic partner for alitalia

8668747 there are around 1 500 people from both the communities who have been rescued by the police
8668748 we have started running shelter homes with food provisions for the people who have fled their homes
8668749 over 300 people fled our village and have taken shelter in the forest

8668755 our most recent format switch proved that were not focused on playing unique interesting or even particularly good music on the mountain now were excited to be following another hot trend my only concern is finding enough german techno to fill the 14 hours a day that we arent playing commercials for titlebucks we may have to fill in the gaps with a few of david hasslehoffs greatest hits
8668756 mom wont let me watch mtv or get on myspace so i listen to 96 5 to find out what everybody else likes

8668759 an historic ad i think this is the first of its kind
8668760 sen mccain is going to have an ad thats going to air in battleground states around the time that sen obama is speaking tonight
8668761 hes going to be talking directly to his opponent so im going to leave it there but its going be very exciting i think that a lot of people are going to focus on it
8668762 history made as major party crowns first black nominee on anniversary of i have a dream acceptance speech a total buzzkill
8668763 senator obama you claim to represent a new post partisan approach to doing business in washington but as usual while you talk the talk i walk the walk
8668764 a congratulations to obama noting that regardless of how one feels about the ones ability to lead even if he had been the best candidate ever he wouldnt have had a shot not too long ago and that america can progress
8668765 senator obama i have been thinking a lot about your comments that i have too many houses and have come to pity the desperation that must have driven you to resort to dealing with felons to get your own home we understand that is hard to get by on only 4 2 million yr my friends being a global celebrity does not mean that you can wave your hands and make enough arugula to feed your family like jesus did with loaves and fishes therefore as a gift to you in recognition of your historic achievement cindy and i have decided to adopt your brother george and donate one of our homes to him
8668766 if you look around people are about an average size 12 to 14 but thats not obese

8668768 a couple of years ago it was in the news saying that barnsley had the ugliest women in england now were being told everyone is fat
8668769 it is extremely unfair barnsley is no worse than any other town or city
8668770 the rationale is that for many years people did heavy manual jobs coupled with a high calorie intake
8668771 this is isnt just a barnsley phenomenon it has happened in other post industrial towns
8668772 however it is a very serious problem here and we recognise that
8668773 we are really pushing physical activity walking clubs have sprung up all over the town and we now have 400 people taking part every month
8668774 we have reinvented rambling which has always had a long tradition here and are building better infrastructure such as cycle paths and opening up walkways and rights of way
8668775 allotments have been introduced to schools and cook and eat sessions are being run with children and their parents these have proved remarkably successful
8668776 there is an interesting and worrying phenomenon that the commission and national regulators have identified
8668777 in some cases operators are charging you for a call of one minute two seconds what they can charge you for two minutes this is a result of not charging by the second
8668778 a lot of operators resorted to billing whole minutes and not the exact amount of time the consumer uses
8668779 most operators did not change their billing system since the introduction of the roaming regulations
8668780 a difference that operators can use to attract consumers with different preferences
8668781 the good news is that we have some players coming back tomorrow gary neville will play nani will be back from suspension so things are looking a bit better for us now
8668782 its important to win it the super cup of course but its also really important for us to get players back on the pitch
8668783 hargreaves will play tomorrow he has been training very well
8668784 he will get 45 minutes to get him started back on the road park is with us he will play part of the game i dont think we will start him
8668785 he has had all his treatment now and has trained for the last 10 days very well
8668786 we have got to be confident we feel he has had the right treatment now its a matter of getting on with it
8668787 for some reason in my mental capacity of understanding what an important game is i played a weakened team
8668788 i played a lot of reserves when i saw lazio celebrating at the end of the game i said to myself that wont happen again they celebrated as if they had won the world cup it will be a good strong side tomorrow
8668789 there is no excuse for us we just have to go out there and win
8668790 ferguson is top of the world if he can work 25 years at a club like manchester with all the pressure then you have really exceptional qualities
8668791 it is a very exciting game for us there is no pressure
8668792 ive no idea whats going on its very hard to get communication with some people in life
8668793 i always give the lineup on the day of the game first to the players
8668794 fine ill mow again but first im going to cut this tree back
8668795 well im going to need to go to home depot
8668796 you tried to cute the tree with my kitchen scissors
8668797 well we dont have yard sheers plus those tree branches are not that big
8668798 lets pretend i am forced to choose between these which would be better

8668805 ich habe bereits angeboten dass sich auf parlamentarischer ebene die klubobleute und die experten einmal miteinander zusammensetzen
8668806 ich rede auf jeden fall bei den fernsehdiskussionen mit ihnen sollte ein weiterer gespr chstermin nach den expertengespr chen notwendig sein werde ich alles unternehmen um zu zeigen es handle sich ausschlie lich um sachgespr che

8668809 travelers need to be flexible to take advantage of the fares
8668810 the arboretum is very cognizant that it has a limited parcel of property with a unique research and teaching mission which means theres a reluctance to trade land for detention ponds if thats all theyre going to be
8668811 so weve tried to meld those missions with what would be considered contemporary stormwater management construction
8668812 urban runoff is becoming more and more of an issue around the country so the research that the arboretum does in conjunction with these projects is going to be used quite widely
8668813 se tra i vantaggi avrai posto il consiglio nel dubbio la consolazione nelle avversit ed altre cose simili certo tutto questo lo si deve aspettare dallamico anche se deve seguire e non precedere lamicizia non avrebbe infatti ancora compreso che cos lamicizia chi pretendesse una ricompensa diversa dallamicizia stessa e la ricompensa per coloro che la coltivano sar piena soltanto quando tutta traferita in dio avr immerso nella contemplazione di lui quelli che aveva unito
8668814 this is not a case of opinion dip shit its a case of reasoned thought i dont care how you feel i could care less how you feel if you dont get that then shut up or get out
8668815 what is the period of development 2 years prior to puberty called
8668816 the mahdi army suspension will be valid indefinitely and anyone who does not follow this order will not be considered a member of this group
8668817 we welcome this announcement that appears to be an effort to support the iraqi people
8668818 the proof is always in the actions and not just in words
8668819 we have set a cultural programme for the mahdi army and we have named it al mumahidun supporters of the mahdi and everybody should abide by it and whoever does not agree with it will be expelled from the army
8668820 we want to transform as large a number as we can of mahdi army fighters into a social organisation
8668821 the resistance is for the professional fighters only that will be selected according to sadrs rules
8668822 a sale to a chinese bank would provoke a very negative reaction from the government and public opinion
8668823 credo sia la conseguenza naturale di quando si incontra finalmente il piede che calza alla perfezione la scarpetta che tengo in mano da anni

8668825 michelangelo buonarroti sosteneva che quando guardava il blocco di marmo vedeva gi dentro la forma dellopera darte e che il suo lavoro non era altro che togliere il superfluo quello di troppo che imprigionava la statua anche noi siamo cos ogni cosa gi qui anche se non si vede lopera darte gi dentro di noi c gi tutta noi non dobbiamo far altro che procurarci gli strumenti per liberarla
8668826 non volevo morire prima di aver compiuto la mia nascita

8668830 zoom airlines limited based at london gatwick and zoom airlines inc based in ottawa canada have sought creditor protection by filing legal notices of intention to appoint an administrator in both the uk and canada
8668831 the airlines flights will continue to operate and the decision to instigate creditor protection proceedings means that the demands of existing creditors are frozen while we continue negotiations on an investment package which already are at an advanced stage
8668832 my biggest stand was people getting involved in selection who shouldnt have been thats now been sorted out the presidents veto doesnt exist any more
8668833 so i just had to sit down and make sure i had my mind right and it is something im really proud to do
8668834 we have got to come up and play some good cricket
8668835 the pressure is on england to win the series i think its going to be a tough couple of games
8668836 the way people reacted when we walked off the field and they booed thats more than enough motivation for the guys to put in a big performance
8668837 weve been in this situation before we turned that around so we fully believe we can do it again its an ideal opportunity for me
8668838 weve got some work to do were by no means out of this series we can still come back and win this 3 2 but were going to have to play really well
8668839 i think england are a very good one day side i think theyve made a conscious decision to maybe get rid of their bits and pieces players
8668840 when theyre all firing and all fit they have specialists in their team that make them one of the best one day sides in the world theyre looking a very very good side and they are being very very well led at the moment
8668841 ive heard so many great things about tel aviv and israel but hearing is one thing and experiencing it for yourself is another we are planning to have a great time and a great evening
8668842 unfortunately the state of israel cancelled your performance in the country due to lack of budget and because several politicians in the knesset had believed at the time that your performance might corrupt the minds of the israeli youth
8668843 a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you who shaped the minds of the generation to come to israel and perform
8668844 a quick assessment of losses caused by kammuri storm and demands for recovery
8668845 there are 8 500 adults and 12 000 children below five years of age who need urgent food aid the government donors the red cross and plan international have provided support to the affected area but have not yet met the demand
8668846 we continue to apply our value oriented principles in selecting new growth stocks as we look for companies with superior profitability and strong balance sheets
8668847 our latest featured investment schw is a prime example and stands out as a conservative way to access to opportunities in the battered financial group
8668848 we are increasing our equity allocation in stocks that should show strong relative performance in a market upturn
8668849 we continue however to be very selective in terms of quality as well as downside risk over the past 20 years brokerage asset management firms have produced more than twice the return of the market following a bear market
8668850 the charles schwab brand is one of the most well known and trusted names in the financial services industry its strategy is to be competitively priced but more importantly to be positioned as the gold standard in client service and integrity
8668851 over the past five years the company has aggressively diversified away from its dependence on trading commissions in favor of fee business in asset management banking and advisory services
8668852 today less than 20 of net revenue comes from trading while the other businesses are producing an enviable and consistent revenue stream that is growing at double digit rates
8668853 this sound diversification strategy has generated strong earnings results on an annualized basis schwab s earnings have grown in excess of 25 per year over the past five years
8668854 while this explosive growth will be hard to duplicate sustainable earnings growth is forecast to be in the range of 15 18 the company also has a solid balance sheet with long term debt comprising less than 20 of the firm s capitalization
8668855 our valuation analysis suggests the company s share price is significantly undervalued as the stock is currently trading near a twelve year low in terms of valuation metrics
8668856 the stock is out of favor with investors primarily due to concerns about the volatile equity markets and a lawsuit that has been filed on behalf of schwab customers who allege they were misled about the safety of a mutual fund that invested in mortgage backed securities
8668857 in addition investors have recently become concerned about the firm s exposure to auction rate securities regulators are questioning 40 major brokerages about their role in marketing these debt backed securities which became illiquid when the auction market dried up
8668858 in particular the new york attorney general is looking at what representations the brokerages made to their customers
8668859 obscured in the long shadow cast by towering gold and platinum a little known collection of other rare metals is sprouting and shooting up like jack s beanstalk right under investors noses
8668860 with some notable exceptions rare metals aren t generally of much use by themselves but in combination with more common metals their unusual chemical properties allow the creation of super alloys with extraordinary capabilities needed for cutting edge technologies
8668861 the more obscure metals may not be as sexy as the precious metals and certainly don t get as much attention but they enable many technologies vital to modern industry
8668862 for example to combat soaring fuel costs that threaten its very survival the airline industry desperately needs turbines that can run at much higher temperatures and rpms
8668863 there are no world market exchanges for most rare metals prices and transactions for minor metals are negotiated directly between producers wholesalers and fabricators
8668864 it s a relatively thin market compared to the volume traded in base metals which makes pricing highly volatile and vulnerable to even small variations in supply demand dynamics price moves of 300 500 800 and more have been common in recent years
8668865 the profit opportunities lie in the companies that produce and use rare metals junior explorers major miners processors producers which make specialty metals and integrators and recyclers
8668866 for starters i want to focus on titanium and molybdenum two rare metals whose price outlook is very positive
8668867 earnings are down not surprisingly due largely to the lackluster u
8668868 the company also has a 75 share of the endako open pit mine mill and roasting facility in northern british columbia and a metallurgical roasting facility in pennsylvania
8668869 tc s second quarter 2008 saw higher production volumes with molybdenum production rising 10 7 to 6 2 million pounds and up 37 7 over 2007 net income in the second quarter jumped 29 1 to 60 4 million
8668870 foreign countries are monitoring and keeping a close watch and waiting for a showdown
8668871 i assign police to do this task without forcibly dispersing the rally
8668872 because of the over the top charges especially the charge of treason
8668873 today the state railway of thailand union has already gone on strike for the first day and tomorrow the unionists at other state enterprises will meet to join them
8668874 we still maintain our goals one all parties have to commit that they will not amend the constitution at all two the government has to quit
8668875 there is no nato naval build up in the black sea as russian authorities are claiming in the media
8668876 we are trying to draw up a strong text showing our desire not to accept
8668877 just because theyre upset that the little pet of certain western capitals didnt fulfil their expectations
8668878 the sco member states express their deep concern over the recent tensions surrounding the south ossetia question and call for the sides to peacefully resolve existing problems through dialogue
8668879 i am sure that the united position of the sco member states will have international resonance
8668880 and i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression
8668881 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8668882 because we have very important matters to communicate to one another and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being annoyed by all those importunate fellows who keep coming in saluting you and addressing you here at least
8668883 that we could have found some retired place on the downs or the seashore
8668884 where we should have been seen all four conferring together so that at the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by his spies that we were holding a council
8668885 there is no desert where a bird cannot pass over ones head where a fish cannot leap out of the water where a rabbit cannot come out of its burrow and i believe that bird fish and rabbit each becomes a spy of the cardinal
8668886 what s going to go wrong in our e enabled world
8668887 blog and wiki and quarterly report will supposedly be read by the opennet initiative researches and measures the extent of actual state level censorship of the internet

8668927 i was a 29 year old kid running for the united states senate in 1972 there was somewhere between six and 10 busloads of people from scranton who just spontaneously got on a bus and came down literally there were hundreds of thousands of people
8668928 barack obama couldve made that speech were he alive in 1972

8668942 ten years ago there was one korean player on the tour now theres 40 or 45 plus the japanese
8668943 its important to note that this whole policy is directed at international members its not about the korean players
8668944 everyones been talking discrimination and its all about getting korean players off the tour and really its the wrong thing to assume its not about that
8668945 the fact is there are a lot of korean players and a few japanese and some of them not most cant speak enough english
8668946 its important that they are able to communicate with the sponsors with their playing partners and even with rules officials
8668947 its not like theyre just left to do it on their own the lpga are going to provide professional services to allow them to work on it and become better

8668952 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8668953 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8668954 having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate insolvency administration proceedings
8668955 the volunteers have been deployed to assist the passengers weve got our food providers helping them out with snacks and stuff to try and make the best of a very challenging situation for them

8668959 hes certainly the liberal leader who has taken his party farthest to the left since mr trudeau if not farther than mr trudeau
8668960 the fact the mr dion opposes any expenditure management in any area of government indicates to us obviously why we have increasingly little common ground in parliament with mr dion and where he is taking the liberal party but more importantly it indicates a direction for the country that i dont think canadians are prepared to accept

8668984 personal marriage issues should be decided by you your family and clergy not by the government
8668985 this ad is just factually wrong and red and blue needs to be held accountable for false and misleading advertisements
8668986 to the contrary the citizen initiated and citizen led amendment 2 has nothing at all to do with government action it has everything to do with citizen action stopping the government from redefining marriage against their will amendment 2 allows the people and not activist judges to decide how marriage will be defined in florida this is only the first of a series of ads in an avalanche of fraud and deception that is going to flood the airways in the october
8668987 i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman
8668988 this hardly seems like unity among democrats on the issue of the definition of marriage
8668989 marriage is not a democratic or a republican issue its not even a liberal conservative issue it is a human issue and a moral issue and one which floridians will vote yes on in overwhelming numbers on november 4 2008
8668990 telling senior citizens that they will lose social security and or domestic partner benefits by voting yes on 2 is outright fraud and preys upon floridas most vulnerable and precious citizens
8668991 the marriage covenant by which a man and a woman form with each other an intimate communion of life and love has been founded and endowed with its own special laws by the creator by its very nature it is ordered to the good of the couple as well as to the generation and education of children christ the lord raised marriage between the baptized to the dignity of a sacrament

8669015 current counter narcotics policies are failing to address the loss of the southern provinces to the dual scourges of poppy production and terrorism
8669016 this decrease is no more than a ripple in the ocean
8669017 without an urgent change of direction in the countrys counter narcotics policies the international community will be unable to prevent the consolidation of opium production in the south of the country and the consolidation of the taliban which is financed by the illegal drugs trade
8669018 with no crop to sell many afghan farmers now face a heavy burden of debt which can only be repaid by planting more poppy in the coming season
8669019 crop eradication has failed to reduce these provinces opium output while succeeding to push impoverished afghan farmers further into the arms of the taliban insurgency
8669020 it is clear that a long term sustainable solution is required to solve afghanistans opium crisis and prevent the insurgencys funding by illegal cultivation

8669068 labor day is coming up in the united states as with most legally mandated monday holidays in the minds of most it has lost any inspirational significance and has become just another three day weekend
8669069 the american labor movement like the old gray mare aint what she used to be down from a high of 35 percent of the workforce to less than 8 percent labor is on its last legs
8669070 thats jesus speaking about his calling a calling to a mission
8669071 yes we have some work to do for the work of love is the work of change weve been called to bring change as gandhi said we must be the change we want to see in the world change isnt easy change isnt simple or obvious its just essential right here right now
8669072 we reaffirm our position that workers have the right to organize by a free and democratic vote of the workers involved this right of organization carries the responsibility of union leadership to protect the rights of workers to guarantee each member an equal voice in the operation of its organization and to produce just output labors for income received
8669073 we recognize the right of labor to organize and to engage in collective bargaining to the end that labor may have a fair and living wage such as will provide and culture
8669074 in the first place employers and workmen may themselves effect much in the matter which we treat saving the workers from being ground down with excessive labor the most important of all are workmens associations but it is greatly desired that they should multiply and become more effective
8669075 what is to be thought of the action of those catholic industrialists who even to this day have shown themselves hostile to a labor movement that we ourselves recommended
8669076 among the basic rights of the human person must be counted the right of freely founding labor unions these unions should be truly able to represent the workers and to contribute to the proper arrangement of economic life another such right is that of taking part freely in the activity of these unions without fear of reprisal
8669077 laborers are always to be regarded as persons and never as a commodity industry was made for man and not man for industry employees as well as employers have the right to organize themselves into a union for wage negotiations and collective bargaining
8669078 we stand for the replacement of the autocratic organization of industry by one of collective effort of organized workers and organized employers
8669079 be it resolved by the international convention of the disciples of christ that it is our conviction that workers should have the right to self organization to form join or assist in forming labor organizations to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing and to engage in such activities as are within the limits of constitutional rights for the purpose of bargaining with employers and other mutual aid protection
8669080 we reaffirm the right and desirability of workers in the united states to organize and form unions we decry the growing wage of anti unionism mounting in the nation today which asks people to forget the struggles that led to this form of negotiation as a just way to settle differences
8669081 in order that the christian principles of respect for personality establishment of brotherhood and obedience in the revealed will of god may find more adequate expression in the economic order we commit our selves to work for the recognition of the right of employers and workers to organize for collective bargaining as a step toward the democratic control of industry for the good of society
8669082 the same rights of organization which rest with employers rest also with those whom they employ modern life has permitted wealth to consolidate itself through organization into corporations workershave the same inalienable right to organize according to their ownplan for their common good and to bargain collectively with theiremployers through such honorable manes as they may choose
8669083 we are convinced that the organization of labor is essential to the well being of the working people it is based upon a sense of the inestimable value of the individual man
8669084 it is the right of every man to organize with his fellow workers for collective bargaining through representatives of his own free choice it is the duty of both management and labor to accept and support conciliations and arbitration in industrial disputes
8669085 we stand for the right of employees and employers alike to organize for collective bargaining and social action protection of both in the exercise of their right the obligation of both to work for the public good
8669086 collective bargaining in its mature phase is democracy applied to industrial relations it is representative government and reasoned compromise taking the place of authoritarian rule by force in the economic sphere in its highest form it is the christian ideal of brotherhood translated into the machinery of daily life
8669087 labor unions have been instrumental in achieving a higher standard of living and in improving working conditions they have helped to obtain safety and health measures against occupational risk to achieve a larger degree of protection against child labor to relieve the disabled the sick the unemployed and to gain a more equitableshare in the value of what they produce
8669088 it was fantastic just the whole way the camp was set up the cabins were cosy and there were over 600 kids taking part in activities

8669137 after we had finally introduced ourselves giving reasons for wanting to participate in the workshop our group leader and published author expert sombre faced and serious quite possibly irritated by late comers like me threw out a question

8669151 im schnitt kommen jugendliche zwischen 16 und 22 jahren das erste mal mit drogen in kontakt
8669152 f r mich ist es eine interessante und spannende herausforderung politik war schon immer ein hobby f r mich was sicher untypisch f r einen jungen menschen ist
8669153 ich wei die situation als ehemaliger spieler einzusch tzen das k nnen einige andere funktion re nicht sie kommen unter druck und es kommt zu einer kurzschlussreaktion ich denke erst ber eine neubesetzung von positionen nach wenn ich sehe dass die verantwortlichen nichts mehr bewirken k nne

8669169 are we talking about the worse preacher in content or in form
8669170 therefore i would argue that while i would certainly give priority to content and primarily all persons in this contest have horrible content the way that a speaker chooses to express that content will sometimes effect our perception of that speaker paula whites content is bad her imitation of a black person makes it much more offensive

8669178 no conozco la trayectoria del caso pero me parece fuera de lugar que la ministra estrada utilice esto como un mecanismo para vulnerar pol ticamente a ortega sin antes tener una sentencia

8669180 es innegable que nosotras estaremos en absoluta solidaridad con la v ctima
8669181 la denuncia puede venir de su hijastra pero todo el mundo es utilizado creen en ortega o fueron enviadas a decir qu ortega es un santico

8669191 gerald and i liked entertaining a lot too and i really loved the years we spent in westmount i went to roslyn school as a girl and then westmount high in fact i just attended roslyns centennial celebration my friend pointed out that i was probably the oldest person there
8669192 he was an expressionist whose work was very colourful and he influenced much of my painting style i love abstract but because i dont want to lose touch with reality i do a lot of landscapes

8669207 we havent been asked to come up with a position on it at this point
8669208 in town of mount royal they have them and they are not offensive to the people who live close by
8669209 unfortunately its very difficult for us to argue against commuters because everybodys saying we want more and more people to be taking public transit downtown if its possible for the line to go via the southern one certainly that would be our preference
8669210 you can be assured the amt will have a position you can be assured that cp will have a position cn will have a position and possibly the residents of hudson and dorval will have a position dont you think that we should have a position at least a position to argue from
8669211 i think the position in terms of the technology is the one that is going to be the most successful because to argue to send it to st henri is not going to have a lot of favour
8669212 how successful have you been so far in getting the amt to incorporate high technology on those lines

8669261 op den duur zal rusland de economische en politieke verliezen gaan voelen
8669262 als het echt respect en invloed wenst plus de daarmee verbonden voordelen dan moet rusland van koers veranderen
8669263 ik hoop dat het meer wordt dan praten en dat het in actie zal worden vertaald
8669264 we moeten ophouden met het toegeeflijke wishful thinking dat rusland de goede richting uit gaat

8669271 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me
8669272 it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again wanting things to change even though people have said some people will forever remain the same
8669273 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrasment sic and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame samantha has not and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful
8669274 has no idea what is going on in my life
8669275 i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is
8669276 so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible

8669282 its a funny thing for women to fight for the kitchen culturally women were expected to cook but professionally the kitchen was dominated by men
8669283 restaurants need a full caretaker im totally obsessed with my restaurant but it doesnt make for a well balanced life and i wouldnt recommend it lightly
8669284 restaurant kitchens are not as appealing to women i dont know why many of the women ive tried to recruit through culinary schools seem repelled by the restaurant lifestyle
8669285 theres this preconception that women cant take the pressure or the stress of a restaurant kitchen but ive always felt like ive had to work a little harder to earn respect
8669286 great women chefs are more inclined to keep food in its purest simplest forms male chefs can often complicate things is it genetics who knows look at thomas keller versus alice waters

8669550 9 groenlinks maakt zich sterk voor een vernieuwde democratische rechtsstaat waar de scheiding der machten consequent is doorgevoerd om de burgerlijke vrijheden te beschermen daarom zal groenlinks zich hard maken voor een grondwetswijziging die rechters in staat stelt om wetten te toetsen aan de grondwet de staten generaal een echte tegenmacht voor het kabinet maakt niet de koningin of de premier heeft het recht om de tweede kamer te ontbinden maar de kamervoorzitter de personalisering van de lokale politiek wordt beperkt en hun lokale autonomie beschermd door de positie van burgemeester af te schaffen en te vervangen door een door de raad verkozen eerste wethouder overbodige en verouderde instituties als de eerste kamer afschaft en de ondemocratische en oncontroleerbare macht van de koningin vervangt door een ceremonieel koningschap de kamervoorzitter leidt de kabinetsformatie

8669559 shocked at what this specific death signifies in the scope of the terminator
8669560 in the very beginning of episode one he really goes through some horrible stuff and it completely changes him
8669561 in the first season my intention was to almost frustrate people by not giving them the savior or hero of the world that they were looking for i wanted him to be weak and young and slightly immature and impulsive
8669562 but this year the hero that will eventually save the world will emerge and it doesnt happen just by accident
8669563 i think we feel a little bit more confident this year because weve established ourselves as our own entity
8669564 before we were so concerned about staying true to the film which we still are but i think we feel that we can be more experimental now and more confident in taking risks
8669565 i wanted so badly to play the anger and the strength and the power and fight of my character and finally thats all ive been doing this year
8669566 everything has become much heavier for john ive gotten to do a lot of action and fighting but more importantly ive gotten to do some strong scenes with the other actors
8669567 i remember when i was a kid watching wrestling i think jake the snake and rick rude had an angle for a whole year it literally lasted a year nowadays if you can go two months with somebody its like oh my gosh we got a lot out of that one this one has been six months and going with no signs of slowing down its hotter now than it ever has been definitely its one of the best if not this best angle ive ever been involved with in my entire career
8669568 it takes a while for people to get used to a new look a new image and a new mindset when they were getting used to it i changed it up into something completely new and different and not playing the old y2j character that was very sarcastic and over the top i wanted to take it all the way down to where if i talk slow and whisper almost the fans are going to have to shut up and listen to what i have to say because im in control im in control every night i go into that ring every night i say something do something or wrestle im the one that calls the shots not the fans
8669569 its the first time ive ever worn short tights in 18 years its great i love it because everyone is like what are you doing why are you wearing short tights
8669570 i think it was bruce pritchard or it might have even been vince asked me why have you been covering those legs for so long its a very homoerotic sport two half naked guys greased up and touching each other
8669571 i studied acting while i was gone and its come in so handy and made me so much more relevant now as a performer because im playing a character more than i ever have im definitely an actor playing the part of chris jericho when im out there it adds so much to the layering and the depth of the mindsets that i have i honestly feel that this is the best ive ever been on the mic and in the ring as well
8669572 graphical quality our goal was always to make sure everything looked just as good as on xbox 360 so there was never anybody who could say hey why didnt i get this on 360 originally because i dont feel like its up to the visual quality were just trying to make sure that everybody is happy

8669580 smart players can come back because they dont lose that
8669581 whether or not he wants to dig in there and give it another shot thats whats going to remain to be seen

8669583 jim rutherford and ronnie francis i consider them friends of mine and i think theyre going to be straight up honest with me

8669600 wij kunnen het ons niet permitteren om eenvoudigweg verder te gaan waar we drie jaar geleden zijn opgehouden
8669601 de wedstrijd moet weer centraal staan en niet de trainer de scheidsrechter of het publiek
8669602 wij dachten dat wij volstrekt kansloos waren onze indruk was dat de clubs ons niet terugwilden
8669603 de nederlandse competitie past nu eenmaal het beste bij de publieke omroep
8669604 als wij het niet zouden krijgen zou het in ieder geval niet te goedkoop bij een andere partij terechtkomen
8669605 wij hadden graag de productie helemaal zelf willen doen de mediawet verbiedt dat
8669606 wij laten zien wat er gebeurt op het veld de wedstrijd bepaalt het verhaal en niet de regisseur sommige collegas richten zich extreem op randzaken dan kwam de derde keeper in beeld die verongelijkt op de tribune zit als je dat opneemt en later in de wedstrijd toont als de eerste keeper een ongelukkige actie maakt dan manipuleer je het verslag dat doen wij niet
8669607 er is de afgelopen jaren volop gediscussieerd f en zo ja hoeveel kijkers het voetbal de rug hebben toegekeerd bij ons keken vroeger naar een wedstrijd tussen ajax en feyenoord in de maand oktober 3 5 miljoen mensen keken naar een ajax feyenoord bij talpa in dezelfde tijd van het jaar keken iets meer dan 2 miljoen mensen
8669608 de populariteit van voetbal is ook goed voor andere sport de eredivisie trekt kijkers die vervolgens ook aandacht hebben voor waterpolo handbal en basketbal dat is mijn theorie van de locomotief en de wagons
8669609 i want to run up there and hold my husband i miss him desperately and i need to hold him and i need him to hold me
8669610 the windiest sites have not been built because there is no way to move that electricity from there to the load centers
8669611 if you want to do it on a national scale where the transmission line distances will be much longer and utility regulations are different congress must act
8669612 bp our neighbor came up with an incentive and said if you had 10 000 what would you do with it and there wasnt a question in my mind what id do with it id build a turbine
8669613 the students will see the meter turning backwards which means were producing more power than were using at that point that power goes onto everyones plan
8669614 if birds are being hit by turbines we can measure it we can count them and weve worked with the odnr and they have a biologist who has given me a protocol how to do this
8669615 my early work in the strip was freer it was more spontaneous
8669616 but i want to combine the confidence and experience i have now with that freedom thats the best of both worlds
8669617 a christian should get very nervous when the flag and the cross start holding hands this is not a romance we want to encourage
8669618 when you are spending a trillion dollars in iraq and untold billions here in america for homeland in security and invest 50 billion in one plane with helicopter features as a better weapon of mass destruction and of course it still is not making us safe indeed it makes us feel less secure in many cases not more isnt it time to ask is fear or faith dictating our dominant national behavior in such matters whats wrong with this picture from a christian point of view at least bell and golden are brave enough to ask the right questions about all of this even though doubtless they are going to be slammed as unpatriotic rather like jews were by the roman empire when they refused to worship at the altars of the emperor cult
8669619 egypt shows us how easily human nature bends towards using power to preserve privilege at the expense of the weak
8669620 part of a larger system a complex web of power and violence and industry and technology that exploits people for its expansion and profit
8669621 theyre commanded do not mistreat or oppress a foreigner for you were foreigners in egypt do not take advantage of a widow or an orphan do not deny justice to your poor people it is as if god is saying the thing that has happened to you go make it happen for others god measures their faith by how they treat the widows orphans strangers the weak among them gods desire is that they would bring exodus to the weak in the same way that god brought them exodus in their weakness
8669622 god doesnt have a problem with eating and drinking and owning things its when those things come at the expense of others having their basic needs when the passionate rants of the prophets really kick in
8669623 for the prophets in exile no vision was too large no dream too big no hope too beyond what would happen in the new exodus a movement bigger than any one nation bigger than any one ethnic group bigger than one religion
8669624 due to this inhuman behavior america will fail she will fail completely among the countries and another nation will rise and take americas place america will lose because her behavior is not the behavior of a great nation
8669625 entitlement leads to becoming immune to the suffering of others because i got what i deserve and so apparently did they in the empire of entitlement when the fundamental awareness is lost that this is all a gift luxuries can begin to seem like necessities excess can become normal and it can be very easy to lose perspective on just how much we have
8669626 if you are a citizen of an empire that has the most powerful army in the history of humanity and is currently on the way to spending a trillion dollars on a war passages in the bible about those who accumulate chariots and horses from egypt are passages about you and your people
8669627 jesus wants to save our church from the exile of irrelevance if we have any resources any power any voice any influence any energy we must convert them into blessing for those who have no power no voice no influence
8669628 jesus wants to save us from making the good news about another world and not this one jesus wants to save us from preaching a gospel that is only about individuals and not about the systems that enslave them jesus wants to save us from shrinking the gospel down to a transaction about the removal of sin and not about every single particle of creation being reconciled to its maker jesus wants to save us from religiously sanctioned despair the kind that doesnt believe the world can be made better the kind that either blatantly or subtly teaches people to just be quiet and behave and wait for something big to happen someday

8669630 terrorism is the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government the civilian population or any segment thereof in furtherance of political or social objectives

8669632 ever felt your self and identity disintegrate into the whims and desires of another person in mainstream sexual relationships this does happen to some extent but in the mistress slave or master slave dynamic it is less of a blending of wills and more of a submission to that of another everydayslaves com is a site that brings you footage of the interactions between some real life bdsm loving couples with over 70 high quality videos and matching high res galleries there is room for improvement on this new site however when you take into account the rarity of finding this type of material and the extras such as wallpapers interviews huge captions section and more that youll get its definitely worth the money

8669780 would not undermine system buildout or result in spectrum warehousing rather it would promote spectrum acquisition and system expansion by assisting carriers in acquiring a customer base the in market exception may serve the interests of the largest wireless carriers but it does not serve the interest of wireless customers who would benefit from increased service availability or mid sized and smaller carriers as reflected in the positions they have taken in this docket

8669786 aha i am individual separate from the other squares i see
8669787 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8669788 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8669789 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8669790 nobody knows i kind of left it on the table when to have it not even doctors can tell me that
8669791 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8669792 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defense
8669793 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field
8669794 its not a decision of anything else but me wanting to play football and whether thats a good decision or not im going to go out and try first to see what i want to do
8669795 it is something he has put an awful lot of time into and we are going to manage it and hope he can manage it and be ready to play
8669796 we are not going to put him on the field if hes not able to go out and perform and he is not going to want to be out there if he doesnt feel like he can perform
8669797 the days he practiced out here was going 100 percent he looked like shawne merriman to me
8669798 it is going to be something he has to manage i see him going out and playing playing on first and second downs and playing on third downs and rushing the passer if managing it means reducing his snaps at different times or picking specific situations where he doesnt need to be on the field that is what we will do

8669814 dass wir einen abschluss unter der inflationsrate zur kenntnis nehmen das spielt es nicht
8669815 apa yang berlaku di permatang pauh bukanlah sesuatu yang terlalu besar untuk mengubah situasi yang telah pun berlaku pada pilihan raya umum yang lalu
8669816 pilihan raya kecil permatang pauh hanya satu pilihan raya kecil yang tidak boleh ditafsirkan sebagai sesuatu yang boleh berlaku di kawasan kawasan lain saya percaya kami masih boleh terus mentadbir kerajaan
8669817 dan untuk dua penggal kawasan itu diwakili isterinya anwar datin seri dr wan azizah wan ismail maka sekarang ini kawasan itu telah balik kepada beliau
8669818 saya ingat bukan itu yang mendorong kemenangan beliau ada perkara lain yang telahpun dijanjikan sama ada nak turun harga minyak sama ada yang berkaitan isu isu kaum yang ada dalam negara kita ini yang pada pandangan saya menarik perhatian golongan tertentu
8669819 tak ada ahli bn takkan tinggal kan bn begitu saja kalau ada masalah dalam parti kita selesaikan dalam parti
8669820 kita mesti meneruskan dan bekerja untuk melaksanakan begitu banyak perkara yang perlu dilaksanakan dan memerlukan perhatian untuk menyelesaikan masalah yang timbul berkaitan kenaikan harga minyak dan barangan makanan dan juga isu lain isu isu itu kita perlu selesaikan
8669821 why didnt all of them support him does this show weaknesses in the party itself
8669822 many of the permatang pauh people including the fence sitters of whom a majority are malays cannot accept such an approach and this resulted in them showing sympathy for anwar
8669823 although it was just a by election it could be an indication of a trend that the voters had already decided that they wanted change even if they didnt know what the changes were and refused to accept bns leadership
8669824 it is clear that we need to make swift changes to the organisation and to the way we do things
8669825 are fairer not racial based politics but one that is based on the profile of the multiracial and multi religious malaysians
8669826 it may be that whatever is said about anwar the people and voters just refuse to believe it
8669827 the explanation given by our leaders was not accepted as though it was already decided from the outset that the bn would lose and pkr would win
8669828 we must respect the voters decision and the countrys democratic practices
8669829 irrespective of the bns view we must accept the peoples decision
8669830 we notice that umno has not been able to attract the fence sitters particularly among the young
8669831 traffic why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
8669832 what we have seen is the emerging economies and developing countries that have been taking the lead it has been really interesting to watch
8669833 many developing countries have come to the table with specific targets with national action plans on climate change
8669834 in poor countries there is less adaptive capacity and there is more vulnerability so when food supplies are affected for example it is harder for a poorer country to be resilient to that to find alternative food sources

8669845 whether to fly carbon neutral was a decision which was left up to each of the delegates themselves

8669847 the un is working towards a mechanism in which all emissions for un conferences will be offset for now its up to the parties but as the un we would very much like that all of these conferences would be carbon neutral
8669848 discussions in a more comfortable environment as well as to limit the use of air conditioning and thereby reduce greenhouse gas emissions

8669866 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning
8669867 even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making

8669876 coal fired power cannot be considered cheap anymore when you factor in the damage caused by global warming and the future costs of carbon regulations
8669877 lose control of your bladder while taking their stress test to show them just how stressed you are then tell them you are on the dole have no money at all and ask so what can scientology do for me went the advice
8669878 it was a huge shock to me leaving like stepping onto another planet
8669879 i grew up in a bible based cult i felt so claustrophobic in my group i
8669880 i had real trouble shopping after i left i remember finding it so hard to work out how to dress how to decide which clothes to buy i felt very alone and knew that no one understood where i had come from i was frightened young very naive and faced with a culture which i had no experience of and which was completely alien to me
8669881 clearly no serious response to climate change can ignore the need to reduce emissions from australias coal fired electricity generation sector
8669882 le hemos dado a la industria lo que buscaba desesperadamente
8669883 hemos tenido la suerte suficiente para ser n mero uno en australia y nueva zelanda estados unidos e incluso dir a que canad
8669884 tuvimos nuestras dudas debido al estado de la industria sabes con las descargas tan prevalentes y las ventas bajando a nivel mundial casi un 20 cada a o no hay duda de que es una cosa que nos preocupa
8669885 moving to a consumption based approach without robust global accounting would involve significant risks for a small open economy such as australias
8669886 it is not helpful for contributors to public debate to overstate the potential effects of policy options while understating the capacity of the economy to adjust successfully to the necessary changes
8669887 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party
8669888 i think what senator obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8669889 can obama force americans to understand the gravity of our problems can he offer solutions

8669893 large scale exports of fresh water would be a wealth creating idea for quebec and all of canada its urgent to look seriously at developing our blue gold
8669894 canadas precious fresh water resource belongs to the people and cannot be bundled and privatized at the whim of government and corporate interests
8669895 water is a fundamental human right and any attempt to divert or export it whether to the u s or saudi arabia must defer to whats in the broad canadian public interest
8669896 in a pre election cycle theres great pressure from corporations to allow the export of fresh water if quebec went ahead other provinces would have to follow
8669897 my bill was intended as a safety measure before a water crisis blows up ill bring it back if theres an election but 90 per cent of canadas fresh water is under provincial control and that complicates things
8669898 we began the study months ago and it is a follow up to the one we did last year on the privatization of hydro qu bec we dont really know how much fresh water we have or whether exporting it would make economic sense but weve got to think about it and be ready if the issue comes to the boil further down the road
8669899 they are politically charged of course and i dont see the government acting at present
8669900 last time they won at celtic to qualify and we went down to the last game to ensure we went through the players and the fans will already be looking to that fixture on the calendar
8669901 its fabulous for celtic fans there are no easy groups there are no free passes in europe
8669902 were just proud to be scotlands representative in there and to be playing the european champions
8669903 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8669904 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8669905 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders therefore they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8669906 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
8669907 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8669908 what was that gentlemans purpose of being among the special forces and what he is doing today i so far cannot answer

8669991 we decided that of the 200 we only cared about the ones that are expressed in the key part of the pancreas where the beta cells are and that got us down to about 28 then we did some lineage studies
8669992 and we got it down to nine joe said my best guess is its these nine and he were right it was a messy experiment mixing all nine and injecting them into the pancreas then we found out that it got better and better as we removed one gene at a time from the nine and eventually we found that it actually works best with three transcription factors that six of them arent that important and thats the fun of science
8669993 if it hadnt worked with those nine wed probably have dropped the experiment and gone onto something else there would have been just too many possible combinations of transcription factors to wade through
