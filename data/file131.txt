1310008 the media seems preoccupied at the moment about peoples dna being stored centrally but the reality is that the database is really a one dimensional invasion of citizens privacy
1310009 two dimensional databases such as the planned telecommunications database of the numbers that people call from their landlines and mobile phones are much more worrying
1310010 not only do you have the numbers called and the locations called from but you have a time based diary from which you can extrapolate their movements
1310011 this has been a highly charged subject for years not least due to the progressive extension of the scope of the database culminating in recent proposals to include young children who might offend in the future or indeed everyone in the country

1310046 the decision to build the tiguan locally is an indication of the strategic importance of the russian market for the volkswagen brand
1310047 for our customers the production of the tiguan in russia means shorter delivery times same quality standards and a very attractive price
1310048 it is our goal to expand our network from the present 63 active retailers to about 120 over the long term
1310049 we will not only be focusing on achieving a good level of representation in urban centers such as moscow and st petersburg but we will also be reviewing possible locations in other regions of the country this year will add another 17 retailers in total to our network
1310050 this top training for dealers means customers will receive not only top quality automobiles but excellent sales and service assistance as well
1310051 the combination of efficiency power performance and design make the a4 the new segment standard
1310052 these are all new models with added standard features versus the previous generation and the a4 when equipped with the all new 2 0tfsi engine and quattro all wheel drive system delivers better fuel economy and acceleration than the key competitors in this segment
1310053 especially after the a4 hit the auto show circuit and photos started to appear consumer interest increased as fuel prices rose the new 2 0 tfsi is a great engine add the new engine to the beautiful design and incredible vehicle technology and i feel that this is the perfect car for the time

1310055 people should not touch it or attempt to pick it up by the tail as these snakes do bite said inspector dave coleman of kent police
1310056 we believe the snake will be looking for a damp dark and warm location and as it had been recently fed it will be fairly lethargic they are also excellent swimmers he said
1310057 we are going to be a pretty tough unit likewise so are the u s and russia and so is china it is just going to be an awesome olympics because the standard of basketball is going to be raised but obviously you got loz and you got penny taylor who is also right up there with lauren as a world class player those two players are the people we center a lot of our stuff around everyone else is trying to complement them as much as we can
1310058 no as the previous olympic gold medalists i think the u s is still going in as the favorites which is good for us we have always been the underdog that is the way we like it we are just a great group of people that work well as a team
1310059 of course going into anything like the olympics you want to win for your country and for me winning an olympic gold medal is the ultimate goal i mean i think i could retire off that but realistically it is very very tough going against the americans and i am not going to deny that but you never know what is going to happen on the day of the gold medal game or the silver medal game or the semifinals there are so many things that can contribute to the outcome of it so it is going to be tough but we are definitely going in there with a particular goal in mind
1310060 it is going to be tough sue and diana in particular are two of my closest friends in the world so it is going to freak me out a little bit especially when right after the wnba season we are all going back to russia together the way we usually do but like i said i am australian and i am going out to give it my very all that day when a matchup between us and the u s comes in beijing we are going to be fighting a war
1310061 fever teammate tamika and i havent actually talked about it we had a few little casual jokes about it but we really havent talked seriously about it
1310062 i have a great relationship with all of my teammates i might not see lauren for seven months and we meet up again and it is just like old times we dont lose that friendship at all even though we are miles away from each other there is certainly no difference in how i respect my teammates and how i get along with my aussie teammates i think i just do a good job of keeping friendships wherever i go
1310063 with spartak moscow in russia it was great we were living together we did everything together 24 7 so that was awesome but the girls on the australian team tully belinda they are like my sisters and they are the people i grew up with people i admire and respect if anything ever happened they are the people i would turn to i think the closeness that we have is special and when we won the gold at the world championships i think our chemistry was really obvious given that we have been playing together so long
1310064 a lot of people talk about world championships a lot of people talk about the olympics a lot is put on the olympics i think because of the whole experience of being there with the other athletes and that total experience of being around everybody else so it would be very special for me to be a part of that and will probably be the pinnacle of my career
1310065 it is all relative i think because of how many people we have in the u s compared to how many people we have in our country i think on an equal scale we probably have the same percentage of fans
1310066 our fans are very knowledgeable for sure i think that is their thing the people that do follow it know the sport really well they arent crazy but it is pretty much the same wherever you go
1310067 i expect all of you to be cheering for the americans and i will be doing my thing for my country the fans are great regardless they make the sport
1310068 i thought we were in a total rhythm tonight offensively and it was predicated off our defense
1310069 we were aggressive defensively we got after it and therefore our transition to our offense really was aggressive as well so i was pleased this really was a great game for us
1310070 we just wanted to get some things done that we didnt do yesterday
1310071 coach donovan talked about it before the game and we were just trying to accomplish those goals we did a pretty good job of putting 40 minutes together of just hard basketball and thats what we are trying to accomplish every time we step on the court
1310072 as a team obviously last night against latvia we came out and we werent playing as intensive defense as we could
1310073 tonight we came out and played much better full court up in your face defense for 40 minutes and i think thats why we were able to win
1310074 i think australia has been playing great basketball when you look at australia right now you can tell they have been together for a while
1310075 and the nice thing about australia when lauren jackson comes off the floor when penny taylor comes off the floor the rest of that team is used to playing without them so although lauren and penny obviously are great players they dont lose that much without them so we expect it to be a great game and im looking forward to that matchup
1310076 here you have the most capable engineers working in state of the art research and development facilities the fiz has vast resources at its disposal from which we benefit directly conversely with its extreme technical challenges and the requisite pace of development the companys f1 involvement represents a unique testing ground for our technicians
1310077 the bmw group can transfer the knowledge gained within the bmw sauber f1 team directly into the development of standard production vehicles this makes formula one the ideal predevelopment platform for innovative drive technologies the new formula one regulations give us the opportunity to deploy innovative hybrid technology under extreme conditions and at the same time glean important insights for production development bmw customers stand to gain from this

1310094 i think of a lot of the corny stuff thats in the nebraska fight song its honesty and simplicity and truth and those kind of things now that might be a little hokey but ive lived all over the country and all over the world and ive found that to be true i think thats manifest in the fans

1310123 we heard that the chinese side pointed out that it is forbidden to film military facilities and it seems like there was confusion because the scene of the assault was just 50 metres from a military facility
1310124 nothing speaks louder of the governments poor faith than the fact that there are more long standing political prisoners in burma now than at any other time since those protests
1310125 the un should no longer accept the governments hollow assurances but hold burma firmly to its word

1310137 this season is just the beginning mark hughes has only just arrived and is trying to build something new and bring in fresh players so this is just a start and we are all looking forward to an exciting time
1310138 i think its a good club with great expectations and one that wants to go forward
1310139 they are fantastic fans who definitely deserve more than they have had in terms of success in the last 20 years
1310140 they want to see more wins more attacking football more aggression and more passion to the play of the team and i hope we are going to give it to them so they can enjoy watching us
1310141 my best years are still ahead of me i have been playing in england for the last four years and i think that every year i have improved including the last 12 months at chelsea
1310142 there is always the desire to keep on improving all professionals think that way you have to keep learning and getting better and i am sure i will do that
1310143 i played 22 times for chelsea which wasnt bad given the rotation there and the size of the squad
1310144 obviously though i am looking forward to playing more at city
1310145 i am not taking anything for granted because there are good defenders here like micah richards and richard dunne but i do not see why we cannot all play together and be fantastic for the club in terms of my fitness the game at stockport was my first for this season but i felt not too bad and hopefully i will get another outing at celtic tomorrow night
1310146 i prefer to play in the middle but i can also play at right back and left back if i am asked to by the manager
1310147 players have to be flexible these days and do any job that the manager asks of them to the best of their ability
1310148 i worked very hard before i even reported back to stamford bridge for training
1310149 i hired a personal trainer in israel and did plenty of running on the beach and gym work and i think i am in good shape it is just matches i will need

1310151 i am still learning about my new teammates but they are a good group who make people welcome quickly
1310152 it is clear to me that the attitude is good and that they all want to improve and do well for manchester city
1310153 i am the second israeli international to be here at city and i know that the first eyal berkovic was a big hit with the fans we are very different personalities but i hope to have a similar relationship with the fans

1310164 too many people in scotland still dont have access to an nhs dentist and we are determined to reverse the years of neglect and bring nhs dentistry within reach of those who currently dont have access
1310165 already we have seen the green shoots of recovery with more registrations of adults and children across scotland we will build on recent increases in the number of dentists working in the nhs with a new 21m dental school in aberdeen due to start training dentists in october
1310166 i look forward to seeing the detailed proposals that come forward from health boards as we take the firm action needed to give scotland a dental service to be proud of
1310167 it is incumbent on the secretary of state to make provision so as to enable migrants who joined the scheme before april 2006 to apply for settlement after four years

1310169 this report is good news for law abiding employers britain has a strong framework of employment rights and it is where these laws are flouted that employees are open to exploitation
1310170 new laws and regulations do little to tackle unscrupulous firms who simply ignore the law while they undercut law abiding businesses this package of reforms will not increase the burden for honest businesses but will help protect workers who are being denied their employment rights
1310171 the government has decided that its internal workings need to be significantly streamlined if it is to offer genuine help to vulnerable workers

1310177 no element of proof whatsoever was found which allows us to form any lucid sensible serious and honest conclusion about the circumstances of madeleines disappearance
1310178 including and most dramatically establishing whether she is alive or dead which seems more probable
1310179 it is obvious that neither of the defendants gerald or kate acted with intent
1310180 they could not predict that the resort where they had chosen to spend a few days holiday would leave the lives of any of their children in danger
1310181 it was located in a quiet place where the majority of residents are foreign citizens of the same nationality and without any known history of this type of crime
1310182 although they left their daughter alone with her siblings in the apartment sometimes for extended periods it is true that in any case they were keeping an eye on them
1310183 we must also recognise that the parents are already paying a heavy penalty the disappearance of madeleine for their carelessness in monitoring and protecting their children
1310184 it seems obvious to us that the crimes of exposure or abandonment can be eliminated

1310201 we call on the fsa to take urgent action on the findings of their research if the worst consequences of the deepening mortgage crisis are to be avoided
1310202 we believe this should involve strengthening the rules on mortgage arrears and lending practices we also call on the government to introduce a mortgage pre action protocol as soon as possible to ensure that lenders only take possession action as a last resort

1310261 the last time we took stock there were some 650 captives operating in india
1310262 from plain and simple cost arbitrage india is today offering tremendous value arbitrage
1310263 low cost does not mean low technology simple low cost solutions often require very complex technology
1310264 we often underestimate the innovative prowess of the domestic players and have so far been looking for technological innovations from the west
1310265 with the launch of innovative products like tata nano and hcl mileap that perception is slowly but surely changing
1310266 the hcl labs serve as hubs of technological innovation and the design centers of future hcl products and solutions
1310267 india is emerging as an r amp d powerhouse its not that india is doing only simple coding work for the global products indian captives are today a major source of innovations
1310268 india has a very strong domestic market that is increasingly getting more prosperous unlike other economies india is not dependent only on exports
1310269 the solutions for india are very different from the solutions multinationals undertake for the developed world
1310270 these business pcs have a high performance machine that has the ability to withstand harsh indian working conditions and delivers productivity and efficiency consistently
1310271 with a small form factor these desktops are ideal for organizations that struggle with challenges such as space limitations data security and power consumption especially in the ites sector

1310335 and youll never guess who dannys after or who he brought along to get the job done
1310336 we needed someone to serve as zadkiels earthly lieutenant and it was actually former series editor aubrey sitterson who suggested danny
1310337 at first i was opposed to the idea but the more i thought about it the more i liked it
1310338 ive always been partial to blaze just because hes a more interesting character more tortured more tragic but im having a lot of fun writing danny and im excited about where were taking him as a character fans have been begging for his return for years now and i like that were bringing him back in a way that people werent expecting
1310339 i will say though that it isnt simply the case of danny being brainwashed or possessed or anything like that and that aint no clone thats the real danny ketch
1310340 blaze got his powers because of a choice he made
1310341 ketch was just the victim of bad luck and some sort of family curse but things are changing for ketch hes definitely making some big choices now and well just have to wait and see how he lives with them

1310360 since his introduction kang has bedeviled the avengers with his grand plans to conquer this era but the swansong of kurt busieks five year run on avengers saw the futuristic warlords most ambitious power grab to date employing an army culled from across the ages and utilizing his knowledge of past history kang causes mass destruction and turns the earth into a virtual prison camp necessitating every avenger ever to stand against him from the lowest lows of wasp capitulating before kang to the highest highs of captain america striking back this ultimate kang saga lived up to its advance billing
1310361 brainwashed super heroes ordinary thugs running around in million dollar tech suits an infamous latverian ambassador and nick fury is in the middle of it all secret war is furys swan song its the ultimate mission in covert ops the war that never happened
1310362 take the kree skrull war sub the skrulls for the shiar pump it up to a near 20 part epic packed with all the bells and whistles that scream 90s and you get operation galactic storm featuring dozens of avengers desperately trying to prevent earth from getting caught in the middle of a cosmic crossfire by working on multiple fronts this epic also changed the nature of earths mightiest heroes for years to come and altered the dynamic between captain america and iron man forever as an ethical debate sowed the seeds for what would eventually explode into civil war
1310363 the crossover that brought the x men back together in what may be their greatest lineup ever theyd been building up to this story for years and it has it all amnesiac x men the art of jim lee the insanely awesome genosha and big bright battles this left the x men changed new rosters assembled and brought a cohesive feel to the x universe that set the standard for over a decade
1310364 it was the first company wide crossover for marvel ever in its own dedicated limited series it gave us the black costume put she hulk on the ff broke up kitty and colossus boo and set the stage for how marvel would still do events 25 years later but it also gave me something that will always be forever grateful as a brand new reader when it came out the toys and comics hit at the perfect time and suddenly i was exposed to all of the characters in the marvel u who would become my favorites even today
1310365 hulk smash not only did this feature some of the hulks greatest battles ever who wasnt terrified of the hulk after that black bolt fight but it also featured a very compelling morality tale when is revenge justified how much is justified and who pays the price for the sins of others excellent storytelling from greg pak and jaw dropping visuals from john romita jr make this a must read for any marvel fan
1310366 you know the old phrase youre your own worst enemy its wrong your worst enemy is a twisted version of yourself a doppelganger who sports a giant mouthful of razor sharp teeth maybe some extra limbs or cracked out versions of your abilities and wholl take your identity after kicking your behind so imagine a whole limited series where earths heroes have to battle their evil dupes near mindless beings who are under the control of magus a blue hued dude who is all the evil aspects of adam warlocks soul given physical presence and maguss right hand man is a dupe of thanos and kang and dr doom travel through time and space together to surreptitiously secure the infinity gauntlet all the while planning to betray each other gah
1310367 you want war well annihilation has it in cosmic proportions think about it you got a war that spans two entire universes destroys nearly the entire nova corps and is so epic that it actually warrants the attention of the almighty galactus not to mention it brings back richard rider as the lone nova centurion into the grand scheme of things and makes him the epitome of badass whats not to love
1310368 what could possibly save the earth from becoming the casualty of an intergalactic war between the kree and the skrulls although you might guess itd take a whole boatload of super powered heroes like the avengers or the inhumans youd ultimately be wrong its all on sidekick supreme rick jones an otherwise ordinary joe with no superpowers whatsoever this complex story of the kree skrull war in fact highlights the strengths of humanity from the visions increasing awareness of emotion to the intuitive intellect of hank pym to ricks heroic actions that bring the war to a close writer roy thomas reminds us that you dont have to be a god of thunder or an iron man to be a hero
1310369 the war that changed the marvel universe on a fundamental level this was more than heroes battling this was a debate over the very ideals we all hold dear the shocking ending puts this event in a whole other level but the nature of this conflict makes it the stuff of comic lore was cap right was iron man right were they both wrong

1310393 im sure this will be the most spread of medals that weve ever seen at an olympic games
1310394 traditionally a lot of time at world championship level its been between australia and america but i dont think thats going to be the case this time were going to see a lot of other counties step up
1310395 weve got to remember that there are so many other countries theres japan were here in china they have a strong contingent and certainly europe that are going to eat into that medal tally
1310396 i think we had a really really strong team this year

1310407 people head in that direction and steer them in the opposite direction just focus on my past and try to contradict whatever it is i might have said or lived and dont focus on the positive things ive done in society in general if you have an article at least balance it out let the people know the good things ive done the schools ive built the kids i feed in africa dont just say he wasnt locked up for three years i dont care if i was locked up for one day its that experience that allowed me to become that person who i am to make a better society for who is listening
1310408 people know what type of dude ross is right now
1310409 they know how thorough of a dude he is now he doesnt have to prove himself to anybody thats what an insecure person would do
1310410 when i heard about it i honestly thought to myself some of them correction officers are some of the most crooked individuals whether he did that or not its all what you take from it
1310411 its a lot of crooked cops out there they manipulate the system
1310412 so im just being real when i heard about it either way if he did it if he didnt do it it could still be crooked from it thats what it all comes down to so thats ludacris two cents on the whole rick ross situation to be real with you man if thats how you want to manipulate the system thats how you do it you get in the system there you have it

1310448 it is absolutely essential that ambulances fire engines and police vehicles can get on and off the site in case of emergency and that the site can be evacuated if the need arises
1310449 we will not compromise on safety we are obliged under law to do all that we can in our power so emergency services can have access to a community of 1 000 people and this is why we have needed to act so access is available

1310453 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1310454 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1310455 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1310456 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1310457 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1310458 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1310459 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1310460 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1310461 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

1310463 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1310464 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1310465 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1310466 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1310467 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1310468 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1310469 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1310470 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1310471 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1310472 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1310473 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1310474 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1310475 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1310476 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1310477 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1310478 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1310479 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1310480 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1310481 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1310482 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1310483 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1310484 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1310485 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1310486 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1310487 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1310488 has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but is in good spirits
1310489 he is having a little bit of surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to help correct the damage
1310490 he says hell be ok and is looking forward to a full recovery
1310491 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1310492 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1310493 hes been the best ambassador our state has ever had
1310494 he could live anywhere in the world and he came back home
1310495 i just think it shows a lot about him as a person and how grounded he is

1310500 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1310501 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1310502 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1310503 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1310504 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1310505 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1310506 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1310507 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1310508 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1310509 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1310510 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1310511 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1310512 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1310513 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1310514 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1310515 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1310516 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1310517 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1310518 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1310519 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1310520 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1310521 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1310522 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1310523 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1310524 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1310525 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1310526 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1310527 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1310528 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1310529 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1310530 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1310531 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1310532 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1310533 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1310534 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1310535 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1310536 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1310537 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1310538 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1310539 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1310540 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1310541 who are open to doing something on the production side
1310542 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1310543 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1310544 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1310545 thats a dumb dumb question because obviously theyre both bossy bottoms theyre both probably gossip girl get top gongs

1310553 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1310554 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1310555 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1310556 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

1310598 carried by assemblyman mark desaulnier d concord ab 2949 outlines the responsibility and liability of lenders regarding abandoned animals pet advocates claim at times banks have prohibited employees from feeding or caring for the pets left behind the measure provides bank employees with the ability to take responsibility for the pets and turn them over to shelters potentially saving their lives
1310599 many homeowners are too stressed or overwhelmed to seek better alternatives for their pets even though alternatives to abandonment exist
1310600 ab 2949 makes it clear that people who find abandoned pets on foreclosed property can immediately intervene to help prevent the animals from suffering all alone

1310608 casualty lists in u s newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation
1310609 these were joint chiefs of staff documents the reason these were held secret for so long is the joint chiefs never wanted to give these up because they were so embarrassing
1310610 the whole point of a democracy is to have leaders responding to the public will and here this is the complete reverse the military trying to trick the american people into a war that they want but that nobody else wants
1310611 the joint chiefs of staff drew up and approved plans for what may be the most corrupt plan ever created by the u s government
1310612 the only way we would have succeeded is by doing exactly what the russians were doing all over the world by imposing a government by tyranny basically what we were accusing hussein himself of doing
1310613 although no one in congress could have known at the time
1310614 rumsfeld and the joint chiefs had quietly slipped over the edge
1310615 there really was a worry at the time about the military going off crazy and they did

1310625 despite such a clear demonstration of the power of integrating search and offline channels surprisingly the strategy has yet to gain widespread adoption unfortunately by failing to integrate their efforts with offline search marketers are essentially ignoring the very channels that drive users to search obviously there is a big disconnect between search marketing strategy and search engine user behavior
1310626 theres no question about the combined power of search and offline channels that is well established whats missing from this equation is the right environment to truly push integration forward and fully reap its benefits it is incumbent upon the cmo to break down the silos eliminate the obstacles that plague its progress and create a culture that rewards integrated efforts
1310627 while search marketers are diversifying their digital content portfolios with videos press releases and images to remain competitive in the blended search landscape their lack of alignment with user behavior suggests that they are missing the mark again this speaks to the big disconnect between search marketer strategy and search engine user behavior to fully capitalize on their efforts search marketers need to take user behavior into consideration at all times

1310676 the risks were obvious and should have been assessed a little more carefully the result is there was a crisis affecting the games
1310677 in my country and in many other countries in my part of the world we were in full boycott mode
1310678 public opinion and political opinion was moving toward an actual boycott of the games and it was only the earthquake tragedy that diverted attention from what could otherwise have been something very very serious

1310680 we respect protests and freedom of expression but violence is against the olympic spirit
1310681 we believe in the strong symbolism of the torch relay

1310683 the torch relay attracts the media and the media attracts the protesters to make it only a national relay will not solve all the problems
1310684 after these incidents we are convinced more than ever that we need to cherish and preserve the flame
1310685 we must make all efforts to make sure these incidents are never repeated again it is a hope i dont know if it will become a reality

1310717 its intended aim was to improve the cars sensitivity during yaw but we found that some of the advantage it brought to that area was being offset elsewhere
1310718 as you can clearly see it is a large structure and one that is particularly sensitive to crosswinds
1310719 we felt that our car already delivers sufficiently in yaw and that continuing to experiment with the dorsal fin might not bring us the sufficient performance benefit wed require to make it worthwhile
1310720 the reality is that you cant isolate the advantages that a singular piece of aerodynamic componentry brings to the cars performance
1310721 while much has been made of the nosebox winglets we ran in testing in jerez and at the hungarian grand prix the reality is that they work in harmony with the whole car to increase downforce and improve balance

1310735 the charge of the knights operation in basra was planned led and executed by the iraqis
1310736 there was no accommodation which prevented uk troops from entering basra the reason why troops were not sent in immediately was because there was no structure in place in the city for units to go back in to start mentoring the iraqi troops
1310737 the success of the mission made it clear that to build on the confidence and experience gained by 14 division a more specialised training approach could be delivered out on the ground in basra and the uk military transition teams mitts were introduced

1310801 that was the fatal flaw in tim learys trip he crashed around america selling consicousness expansion without ever giving a thought to the grim meat hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him too seriously all those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy peace and understanding for three bucks a hit but their loss and failure is ours too what leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life style that he helped to create a generation of permanent cripples failed seekers who never understood the essential old mystic fallacy of the acid culture the desperate assumption that somebody or at least some force is tending the light at the end of the tunnel
1310802 of greatest significance to me has been the insight that i attained as a fundamental understanding from all of my lsd experiments what one commonly takes as the reality including the reality of ones own individual person by no means signifies something fixed but rather something that is ambiguous that there is not only one but that there are many realities each comprising also a different consciousness of the ego one can also arrive at this insight through scientific reflections the problem of reality is and has been from time immemorial a central concern of philosophy it is however a fundamental distinction whether one approaches the problem of reality rationally with the logical methods of philosophy or if one obtrudes upon this problem emotionally through an existential experience the first planned lsd experiment was therefore so deeply moving and alarming because everyday reality and the ego experiencing it which i had until then considered to be the only reality dissolved and an unfamiliar ego experienced another unfamiliar reality the problem concerning the innermost self also appeared which itself unmoved was able to record these external and internal transformations reality is inconceivable without an experiencing subject without an ego it is the product of the exterior world of the sender and of a receiver an ego in whose deepest self the emanations of the exterior world registered by the antennae of the sense organs become conscious if one of the two is lacking no reality happens no radio music plays the picture screen remains blank

1311039 is always pained to have to extend tours he understands the effect that has on the families of our forces but he also appreciates our commanders need to make additional progress while the weather is still good in afghanistan
1311040 the risks were obvious and should have been assessed a little more carefully the result is there was a crisis affecting the games
1311041 in my country and in many other countries in my part of the world we were in full boycott mode
1311042 public opinion and political opinion was moving toward an actual boycott of the games and it was only the earthquake tragedy that diverted attention from what could otherwise have been something very very serious
1311043 its been done and resolved and we escaped this disaster
1311044 we respect protests and freedom of expression but violence is against the olympic spirit
1311045 we believe in the strong symbolism of the torch relay
1311046 it is illusory to think the simple elimination of the international relay will make all the problems disappear
1311047 the torch relay attracts the media and the media attracts the protesters to make it only a national relay will not solve all the problems
1311048 after these incidents we are convinced more than ever that we need to cherish and preserve the flame
1311049 we must make all efforts to make sure these incidents are never repeated again it is a hope i dont know if it will become a reality
1311050 i am convinced the games will be a great success and will be well organized
1311051 asafa powell is the second fastest man in the world
1311052 and tyson gay is the world champion and hes running really fast
1311053 i wish him the best so he can get back in shape
1311054 by the same token the companys doing pretty well and were really happy with what were doing so well see i mean anything is possible
1311055 we had been socialised to doing so many things ourselves whether its box creation funding our own development etc when we came to meet with folks about a distribution deal and i use that phrase intentionally we were looking for somebody to do a certain set of services that we didnt want to do or werent versed in and nothing more
1311056 ea was very progressive about saying we understand who you guys are we understand what steam is we dont want steam to go away well they might want steam to go away but theyre not asking us to make steam go away
1311057 sure you could go to the library and borrow books and get this exact same service for free but then youd have to interact with people plus you can get the dirty books and nobody will ever no
1311058 we are guides go find out things for yourself well lead you along in the journey but you will be the one that assures you make the correct destination we dont keep things secret its all there for you to find you just have to look for it yourself
1311059 yes i would clone my pet dog because he is really cute and i want lots of dogs like him
1311060 no each pet has its own special qualities that just cant be replaced in a clone why didnt she just breed the dog and get some real puppies for about ten times less than that not only is there a ridiculous cost involved but its a disgusting thing to do anyway
1311061 i would never clone my dog she is one in a million and even if the clone looked exactly like her she would never be mine
1311062 no way cloning pets is a stupid and unnecessary thing to do if people clone pets then something might go wrong and cause the animal pain
1311063 i think it is cruel and unnecessary there will only ever be one of you in the world with your looks and personality so it should be the same with animals i bet youd rather your animal die peacefully instead of cloning it and letting it live with a life full of health problems
1311064 i wouldnt because i find it a bit cruel to the pet one pet is enough to care for tlc cant go to more than one pet the first pet is the best
1311065 your pet is an individual there is no other like your dog and i dont think you should spoil that relationship with your special pet
1311066 i have never let my schooling interfere with my education
1311067 a person going up and down the stairs numerous times
1311068 that way i dont have to say up and down so many many times
1311069 g shell be using phrases like these with you and you will be gaping like the deer that is caught in the headlights
1311070 would not one word do to convey the meaning i mean does it have to be as long as an engine with a caboose attached to it does it mean that the longer the expression the more delicious the food
1311071 we used to always think of this industry as the cycle i think the reality now is there are several sub cycles
1311072 its hard now to talk about the cycle i think we have to talk about all of the cycles the way we think about it at thq is we plan our business around each of those platforms not around the cycle
1311073 in west africa nigeria has always played the top role in all aspect and sport is an area where we have always done well in cote divoire i expect nigerian polytechnics to occupy the top ten if you look at the first edition in lagos you will notice that we dominated in all categories i football volleyball and basketball are games i look forward to because we are going with six teams for each of them other countries do not have that luxury the second area is racket games which has recently been developed in the country in all we have an advantage to excel and with the nigerians behind us we promise to do our best
1311074 as a way of responding strongly to the call for corporate sponsorship of sports in nigeria by the federal government
1311075 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
1311076 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
1311077 reminiscent of benito mussolinis edict of the 1920s which banned groups of five or more people
1311078 gatherings in a bid to protect public decorum and prevent damage to public parks and gardens
1311079 there is no emergency situation in novara there is no need for such a fascist edict there are other better ways to tackle the citys problems
1311080 this is needed to limit public disturbance the citizens of novara asked for it i understand opposition left councillors plan to gather and protest in groups of more than three we will not fine them this time
1311081 one thing i will say though is that to compare the ordinance with fascism is absurd we are trying to solve issues but are being accused of fascism
1311082 i really dont see the need for troops on streets it will have a completely negative effect
1311083 i have already had people calling me after reading reports of troops on streets in italy and asking me is there some sort of civil war going on
1311084 its an image boosting operation that risks turning into a boomerang
1311085 it will make italy look like a country in the grip of an uncontrolled security emergency
1311086 paratroopers guarding the centres of the major tourist cities arent exactly a great calling card for a country at the height of the tourist season
1311087 we will have one soldier for every 10 municipalities doing nothing except going to the bar with a policeman its a joke and to cap it all its only a provisional measure
1311088 we are opposed to any attempt to politicise the games
1311089 the chinese governments control on the internet is contrary to the free reporting environment promised by the hosts and contradict international olympic committee ioc assurances that the press will be able to operate as at previous games
1311090 we hope the media could respect relevant laws and regulations of china
1311091 im not afraid neither are my colleagues we are used to being in the toughest groups at the world cup
1311092 the purported termination of our sponsorship contract was a most unusual and surprising development considering that the company had all along fulfilled all aspects of its obligation under the contract in addition to committing huge resources and goodwill to the development and promotion of football in nigeria iyanam remarked adding
1311093 we promised that we would do our best to live up to expectations and we did just that
1311094 we register for two categories which are the main tournament and the veterans cup which is played by players above 30 years old
1311095 even though some key members of the team were unable to travel because of visa problems we went ahead to win the veterans category and played in the final
1311096 the main reason for having our own awards is that we are disturbed by the unacceptable and disturbing behaviour of some clubs regarding the awards that were hosted by the nfa
1311097 we want a system in place where we will announce the scoring of points by clubs and players before the awards take place this will eliminate confusion and the public will know the reasons why certain individuals can win the awards and while some cannot
1311098 we announced a 30 man squad for the tri nations home leg and it will remain a 30 man squad
1311099 they can come back any time they can come back tomorrow if there is an injury today
1311100 one shouldnt look at the flyhalf position in isolation we were not selecting only a flyhalf
1311101 we are selecting a team and we have to get the composition of the team right percy will never start a test at flyhalf while i am coach
1311102 but if there is an emergency in a game then we will play him you also have to appreciate the fact that ruan has not played much at flyhalf
1311103 if i had a choice to put 17 or 18 players on the field i would never have released the players they are very good rugby players and assets to the team but then again if we can release players of that calibre to play currie cup rugby we are in a very privileged position
1311104 not one of them did anything wrong and they deserve to be part of the squad but the players there also deserve their places
1311105 i believe you are playing against argentina i know almost everyone in the country wants you to win good luck make us proud
1311106 this is intended to encourage all the teams to work very hard
1311107 they cannot just be content with finishing second best players should know that they are going for the first prize because it is winner takes all history does not remember those who finish second
1311108 for the purpose of providing a high profile tournament specifically for professional golfers at a time when they were generally not held in high esteem in a sport that was largely run by wealthy amateurs
1311109 strongest all professional international field in major championship golf as it was more than 80 years ago the wanamaker trophy is still prized as one of the golf worlds greatest treasures
1311110 i am glad i brought this course this monster to its knees it was the greatest test of golf i have ever played and the toughest course
1311111 mr president in his wisdom and as keen sports man has decided to draw the curtain from previous jamborees and open a new chapter in doing things right in the sports sector

1311118 it will be very hard to do as well this season
1311119 when giuly signed psg got their smile back and when makelele signed they got their ambition back
1311120 i can sum it up for you in three words
1311121 what is it that we are all so busy doing all day
1311122 since the world continues to turn just as well without the daily publication of hansard

1311126 but i do believe that we need to ensure that with a culture which encourages facilitates and celebrates success theres also a parallel culture of responsibility reciprocity and respect of those to whom much is given much is expected
1311127 bukan hanya dpr yang bisa main bola liar dan panas kami juga bisa
1311128 jika memang tenaga honorer khususnya guru bertindak profesional dalam pekerjaannya seharusnya pemerintah juga menggagas perlakuan secara profesional juga akan tetapi dari data yang kami miliki di sragen pada kenyataannya masih banyak dari mereka yang digaji rp 50 000 atau bahkan sama sekali yang digaji

1311145 there was some fear that we would alienate the artists
1311146 we started just feeling it out there wasnt that much of a push back because the coolest thing about rage on the design side is that we can pull in and add these little elements
1311147 especially on the psychology horror side and some things we could have pushed for but rage allows us to to me i was just elated because i got to do a lot more things than i would ever do in the survival horror genre

1311167 their speed is a full team speed we got tired chasing them they got on a roll in the second half and didnt let up
1311168 we adjusted our blocking up front and went with fresh backs once ferriter got going there was no stopping that offense

1311191 we have a beautiful beach i told my staff the other day the good news that we got this recognition i then told them the other news is that we have to work even harder to ensure that we retain our five star rating and that hampton beach continues to be one of the best beaches around
1311192 i think the people who know what the fire department needs are already here on the inside
1311193 the idea behind using a porous pavement is that it allows the saturation of water back to the earth to happen where the water falls
1311194 the horse has got a leg and a half between two holes in the floor its eight feet underneath

1311210 this is perhaps one of the most commonly asked questions
1311211 a cursory examination of a flat earth map fairly well explains the reason the north pole is central and antarctica comprises the entire circumference of the earth circumnavigation is a case of travelling in a very broad circle across the surface of the earth
1311212 what about the stars sun and moon and other planets are they flat too what are they made of
1311213 you could argue that no one is ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you can argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office the constitution sets the qualifications for president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president we have two choices i think he should win and i think he will win

1311261 enkele dagen geleden had je het over zomertijd komkommertijd nou als je in het stadsblad van vandaag de aangevraagde kapvergunningen leest is dat zeker niet zo geen komkommers maar wel kommer en kwel wat is het geval voor het amstelpark worden door het stadsdeel drie kapvergunningen aangevraagd in totaal voor 73 bomen 8 wilgen op het kermisterrein vanwege watermerkziekte en herinrichting van het terrein 28 bomen in verband met uitbreiding van de japanse sfeertuin en aanpassing van het sortiment en 37 in het pinetum plus verplanten van 6 bomen in verband met revitalisering overigens alles met herplant dat wel maar het betekent een enorme aanslag op het gezicht van het park omdat je mooie volwassen bomen gaat vervangen door wat je regenwoordig sprietjes noemt we beginnen daarmee eigenlijk weer bij af oftewel 1972 toen hier de floriade werd gehouden het ergste vind ik het vervangen van de bomen in het pinetum destijds de inzending van de wereldberoemde bomenkwekers uit boskoop het pinetum ligt in het hart van het park en is zeer beeldbepalend een zorgvuldige compositie van een prachtige collectie daar gaat straks een heel lelijk gat ontstaan ook na herplant de vraag is of dit nu echt nodig is coniferen zijn er juist in het algemeen op gebouwd dat ze heel oud kunnen worden en dat ze heel goed bestand zijn tegen slechte groeiomstandigheden kijk maar in de bergen of in het hoge noorden maar ze kunnen niet tegen het geweld van kettingzagen bijlen boomversnipperaars hoogwerkers en graafmachines zienswijzen vroeger heette dat bezwaarschriften binnen veertien dagen en misschien is een onafhankelijke contra expertise op kosten van het stadsdeel ook niet verkeerd

1311266 a momentous economic slowdown is now under way we believe the deterioration in spain is just in the beginning stages the bulk of the pain will be suffered in 2009
1311267 the probability of a crisis scenario similar to the early 1990s is increasing if the erm exchange rate mechanism scenario were to become reality the main concern would not be earnings but capital
1311268 we estimate that a non performing loan ratio of 10pc to 15pc for developers loans would fully erase earnings in 2009 and would represent between 20pc to 30pc of the current tangible capital base of banco popular sabadell and banesto
1311269 the economic situation is worse than we all predicted we thought it would happen slowly but instead it has hit fast
1311270 what was the state supposed to do stop people building houses that wouldnt be reasonable tell the banks who they can lend money too we couldnt do that either we warned that building 800 000 homes a year was not sustainable and that granting mortgages for 40 years was folly but there are certain things the government cannot prohibit

1311305 if the head coach has to go to four or five cities in a week and theyre hard to get to cities then we will use a private aircraft if coach phillip fulmer is flying to say arkansas or texas or somewhere where an assistant is going then that assistant can get on that private plane too well be smart there but we will not schedule one just for an assistant
1311306 if fulmer could get 25 kids from the state of tennessee hed do it

1311336 we want to make this message very clear we are not going to allow this country or any other country to destroy the anc or its leader comrade jacob zuma we are going to make sure that zuma becomes the next president of this country no matter what no zuma no country
1311337 to make sure the judge does not make an arrogant decision
1311338 they the sunday times should not be bringing this stuff and making these allegations now it is aimed at discrediting the anc president as he goes to court
1311339 no why this thing has been done by the enemies of zuma
1311340 they the allegations should just be dismissed we cannot allow it
1311341 the nec expressed its utter distaste at the continued manipulation of important institutions of our democracy by individuals who are determined to advance their agenda which seeks to destroy the anc president and the anc itself
1311342 remains confident that justice will prevail and our courts will rise above partisan political agendas in dealing with the zuma matter

1311347 yes planning departments right across the state are under pressure however i did look at those issued during the preparation of the report and workload didnt arise as the cause of this particular problem certainly seeing things printed in the paper about how we have not excelled in a performance sense causes pain to staff in general but it has happened we need to recognise errors were made and rectify how that was allowed to happen
1311348 the pear trees are an exotic species and in a sense were a mistake they should probably have never been planted so they will be transplanted and we will then replant the area with an avenue of native trees and shrubs which is more in keeping with the area
1311349 the number of people with low vision is increasing over time

1311355 im sure im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1311356 we will evaluate those and should problems arise we may have to take some action
1311357 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
1311358 the new full high definition screens look amazing you can see every detail and with the olympics being broadcast in hd it will be just like being there but with better air quality
1311359 i want an lcd because thats a personal choice issue and while im looking forward to watching the swimming and athletics i also love the big screen for movies i am a big movie fan
1311360 i am aware of the environmental implications of a big screen
1311361 i dont think people realise just how much they cost to run
1311362 but our household is changing to 100 per cent green power this week
1311363 there must be an election in the air its amazing so many councillors are positioning themselves as friends of the environment five weeks out from the election when all of a sudden its hip to be green
1311364 i mean dont get me wrong im heartened that people have embraced my political position but you really have to be a bit cynical about it all
1311365 to suggest i cant move an environmental motion is ridiculous i do research these things and i was just a little miffed as to why councillors seem to think they are the only ones entitled to have a focus on environmental issues im just a bit flabbergasted by the whole thing really
1311366 deploying a distance education and learning model del using the latest elearning technologies is now a vital strategy for all colleges and universities to ensure success in this web 2 0 savvy academic and business community need 2008 is designed to enhance emerging and established career colleges and institutions of higher learning
1311367 an e learning solution in todays context can take care of both trainers and learners it should be designed to facilitate easy course delivery and administration in an all in one user experience at neted our primary goal is to assist training vendors and institutions to launch complete e learning solutions with built in content out of the box in turn around time
1311368 as a completely online school working with neted and receiving the need grant was vital to our ability to deliver quality instruction to our students faster better and on a much shorter timeline than we initially anticipated
1311369 stated brian lee vice president business operations for california university of technology
1311370 although the widespread acceptance and convenience of an online degree are well suited for working professionals high tuition costs still create affordability barriers for many students we realize that the majority of potential graduate students do not work for large corporations that can foot their educational bill with the caluniversity scholarship highly motivated students can earn an mba or doctorate with lower initial investment in their education endeavor
1311371 it is somewhat ironic that use and adoption of technology in online education has not really brought the cost down so you still have students that cannot afford a quality college education i wanted to create an online institution based on the principle that a quality education should be attainable for everyone anywhere and at anytime
1311372 its hard to balance a job and graduate school and then you have the financial burden on top of everything else one of the main goals of caluniversity is to provide an exceptional educational program with affordable tuition combined with a flexible delivery method this allows me to work full time and still work on my doctoral degree
1311373 the scholarships are merit based awards and will help qualified students with up to 50 tuition we encourage students who have a proven success rate at work or in their personal achievements to apply as we are committed to assist them in this academic endeavor earning an mba will predispose them for career advancement opportunities

1311381 what the mccain campaign doesnt want people to know according to one gop strategist i spoke with over the weekend is that they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch i guess thats political hardball but another word for it is the one word that most politicians are loathe to use about their opponents a lie

1311403 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than imagined
1311404 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1311405 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten into extinction
1311406 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date

1311425 that part of st paul around third and earl hasnt changed much over the years
1311426 leprosy has been curable since 1945 most people dont know that
1311427 most think its highly contagious but in fact its barely contagious in fact 95 percent of the population is immune and couldnt get it if they tried the other 5 percent are only susceptible if they are exposed for a long period of time
1311428 it exists in places where people cant get the medicine or cant afford it
1311429 this substantial investment will allow health boards to put in place a range of new and improved health facilities to serve people in communities right across scotland
1311430 too many people in scotland still dont have access to an nhs dentist and we are determined to reverse the years of neglect and bring nhs dentistry within reach of those who currently dont have access
1311431 already we have seen the green shoots of recovery with more registrations of adults and children across scotland we will build on recent increases in the number of dentists working in the nhs with a new 21m dental school in aberdeen due to start training dentists in october
1311432 i look forward to seeing the detailed proposals that come forward from health boards as we take the firm action needed to give scotland a dental service to be proud of
1311433 i recently received a phone call from an old friend in which they were very upset as they were in traffic about the vdot information system or lack thereof

1311436 there is no such thing as green honey it is a scam and it has reached alarming proportions because apparently these people have started producing the so called green honey even using shoe dye
1311437 we got alarmed by reports coming from local and foreign tourists who have complained about the fake products being sold openly around the city this is a big concern for us because of its negative impact on the citys booming tourism sector
1311438 we must unite all communities concerned to beat the scourge of youth violence universally once and for all
1311439 it is vital that anti homophobic bullying polices and initiatives which aim to prevent further tragic deaths re evaluate how much of an impact they really have and how they can become more effective by updating their understanding of incredibly violent nature of britains youth culture
1311440 the events in huyton over the past few days is proof that young people from our poorest most marginalised sections of society are the victims regardless of the cause
1311441 we are all shocked and saddened at michaels death our thoughts are with his family and friends and we would like to extend our deepest sympathy to them
1311442 we realise many people locally may want to offer their messages of support and sympathy to michaels family and with this in mind we have opened books of condolence at huyton kirkby prescot and halewood one stop shops as well as whiston library
1311443 it was going to happen sooner or later and i am stunned how the local media here in liverpool have downplayed coverage of this story which i feel is due to the lack of a vocal lgbt community in liverpool
1311444 its very easy for the increasingly comfortable and apathetic gay community to blame working class youths for this latest attack but having partnership rights and a few extra equality laws is not an excuse to abandon the ongoing fight for gay liberation
1311445 mayor hadji cuyo tried to save the policeman but he was too heavy
1311446 so far we have not received any report of casualties
1311447 i think that the right was wrong to get hung up on homosexuality
1311448 i think we indulged prejudice in the eighties and missed the point its not gay men whore abusing women and abandoning children its straight men
1311449 and the demand for civil partnerships proper inheritance rights and equality in adoption rights from gay couples is not a rejection of commitment but a desire to see commitment celebrated and publicly embraced
1311450 i also think the right was wrong in its rhetoric about single mothers we need to recognise that its those fathers whove abandoned their responsibilities not mothers left holding the baby who should be challenged about their behaviour
1311451 every statistic shows that children grow up more likely to do well in school stay out of trouble and have a happier life if they have both a male and female role model
1311452 too often we look at these things from the point of view of the adult rather than the child i think that adoption by homosexual couples is unsatisfactory for the child
1311453 what homosexual people choose to do under their duvets is up to them but the example they set to children is of interest to society as a whole
1311454 i was part of a generation that at university it was natural and normal to have gay friends and i had friends both gay men and lesbians coming out at the time
1311455 therefore im part of a generation that finds it difficult to understand many of the arguments that were being made by people older than us against equality
1311456 as society has grown up and become better able to deal with sexual diversity there are still taboos to be tackled and difficulties that need to be dealt with when it comes to adolescent sexuality
1311457 in particular i think its the case that society is still finding it difficult to work out how to deal with young people below the age of consent who are attempting to deal with a sexual orientation that is not the majority orientation that requires some sensitive handling
1311458 you cant pay attention to popular culture and whats happened in the last ten years without being aware of a nasty edge to bullying and intimidation and sometimes it can have a homophobic element to it
1311459 i walk at least one marathon and multiple half marathons each year and have done so for 3 years now i live in arizona where training in the summer is grueling will walking on a treadmill change my stride or somehow lessen the hard surface street impact that seems necessary to the training process
1311460 this ground breaking ceremony here in the senate will signal the start of an across the country jpepa free zone campaign where the countrys fishing waters will be declared as free from japans 21st economic invasion and re colonialization of the philippines
1311461 once a fishing ground is declared a jpepa free zone area japanese factory ships hunting philippine tunas and other precious marine resources shall be exposed opposed and if possible barred from entering the countrys territorial waters
1311462 you get the sense that maybe he wasnt seeing angie as a person then you get an idea of the violence behind this act
1311463 it just cant be tolerated at any level and i hope that if anything positive were to come of this we would develop a stronger relationship with the gay lesbian transgendered community so that they understand just how seriously we take crimes like this and how vigorously we will pursue justice in a situation like this
1311464 angie gave me the power to not care what people thought of me
1311465 she always just wanted to be who she was and that was female and to be loved
1311466 there was nothing that could be done to pull it the campaign was going to end before that whole chain of events could take place
1311467 theyve gotten a tremendous amount of free publicity at south carolinas expense
1311468 i just find it really strange that the south carolina parks recreation amp tourism think they are somehow doing their states industry a favour by creating so much negative publicity for their local tourism industry
1311469 in 2008 homophobia is just not a smart tourism marketing strategy if it ever was shambolic probably does not go far enough in describing their ineptitude
1311470 i made a serious error in judgment regarding the political sensitivities surrounding the marketing opportunities with amro vacations and the london campaign
1311471 the ads content certainly dont represent the public policy of the state
1311472 upon the request of the chinese side the president will hold a bilateral meeting with president hu jintao to discuss bilateral relations
1311473 it came out in our initial investigation that cuesta has been asked by one of the parties involved in the case to stop his harsh commentaries we are focusing on this angle kasi ito lang yong pinakamalaking issue na meron siyang nakabangga na malaking tao this is the biggest issue in which he came up against a prominent person
1311474 but maybe the issuance of mr and mo was still under process as cuesta was not carrying a firearm when shot at by two unidentified suspects
1311475 we could not be intimidated by such cowardly act of trying to eliminate our colleagues in the media profession we remain firm in pursuing our quest for justice and fairness even if this would cost our lives
1311476 as cuesta fights for his life this attack is a chilling reminder of the culture of impunity for those who would attack the philippines media
1311477 the philippines authorities must fulfill their responsibility to protect each and every person from such violence the fact that journalists continue to be targeted is a clear indication that the authorities actions or lack of actions are not delivering the message of zero tolerance
1311478 we have stopped selling grand theft auto gta and inform all legal vendors to withdraw the game from their shelves
1311479 the company will not import gta 4 the next in the series to distribute in thailand
1311480 even though i havent played important international matches for four months i have been training really hard and i am in good condition
1311481 i feel happy to transfer to ac milan i am a professional footballer every transfer is a new start for me
1311482 but for the moment the most important thing is the olympics its a great honor to represent brazil in the games
1311483 my goal is to create history for brazil the olympics is as important as the world cup and copa america everybody wants to be the champion in the olympic games
1311484 we stay in our bedrooms and the dining rooms not in the open
1311485 im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1311486 i was up here last september and the smog was a lot worse then
1311487 its too soon to say anything about my condition i only arrived on monday and ive got jet lag but im more tired than normal
1311488 the second half of the season is tougher than the first especially if youve played a lot of tough matches on clay like me
1311489 its tough to stay at 100 percent throughout the whole season after all these matches im more tired than the rest
1311490 schluss mit den fehlern schluss mit den problemen bei der zuverl ssigkeit des autos
1311491 wir m ssen mit demut entschlossenheit und starkem willen arbeiten um diese phase zu berwinden und unsere ziel zu erreichen
1311492 with regards to internet access there appears to have been last minute progress achieved
1311493 however there has been considerable damage done to us and in my part of the world what was somebody elses problem has become ours this should not have been in the glare of press discussions in august 2008 as we have all known that this could be a problem ever since beijing was elected and we should have taken whatever steps necessary this turned into our problem when it shouldnt have been
1311494 however the other day i was asked would i apologize and i said i would not apologize as the ioc does run the internet in china
1311495 there will be though a review of what happened when we come to audit the games when they are over
1311496 the uncertainties have been resolved but there has been a lack of clarity from our point of view and i take responsibility for that
1311497 obviously some sites would not have been suitable such as pornographic subversive or those acting against the national interests
1311498 but there were some valid ones who were also barred but that has been cleared up and all is calm now for the moment
1311499 i withheld my concurrence meaning i did not concur with the treaty because the two countries could not agree on the side agreement which was intended to resolve or cure the disagreements between the two countries
1311500 in any event there is no more debate on constitutionality because the japanese foreign minister has authorized the japan ambassador here to enter into an exchange of notes presumably with secretary alberto romulo of dfa department of foreign affairs so that all constitutional provisions in our philippine constitution that conflict with jpepa will be deemed to be dominant or superior to any jpepa provision
1311501 and since the constitutional provisions over which i was very adamant for the past year have already been accepted by japan i have no more problem with it as a constitutional law scholar
1311502 in any event now we will no longer have to debate it so my hopes are high that we will be able to get the two thirds vote two thirds of 23 should be about 15 or 16
1311503 well it is edging toward ratification and i hope i will be able to convince them tomorrow because we lose a lot in terms of economic benefits if we do not concur
1311504 without the enabling law what will determine the plebiscite without the enabling law this moa will just be a scrap of paper
1311505 the peso is tracking crude oil lower and inflation numbers are no surprise
1311506 we do believe that further interest rate hikes are warranted and look for the central bank to deliver further tightening in the months ahead
1311507 views of peaking domestic inflation and plunging export numbers are important drivers of the recent singapore dollar weakness in our view
1311508 we chose to partner with global graphics on the strength of their edocument library

1311537 was k nnen die spiele f r die entwicklung ihrer spieler bringen
1311538 so ein turnier bringt die jungen spieler immer weiter man sammelt erfahrungen die man sonst nicht sammeln kann weil man sich international bewegt weil es eben die olympische spiele in einem besonderen ambiente sind das sind au ergew hnliche erfahrungen
1311539 die er ffnungsfeier werden sie der mannschaft aber nicht g nnen
1311540 das habe ich entschieden dass wir das nicht machen das ist nicht zu verantworten zwei tage vor dem ersten spiel wenn man wei dass man stundenlang irgendwo stehen muss da w rde ich ewig ein schlechtes gewissen haben wenn wir das erste spiel verlieren w rden nat rlich m chte jede mannschaft gerne einmarschieren was ich auch verstehen kann ich habe auch schon mal mit tr nen in den augen auf der trib ne gesessen und beim einmarsch zugeguckt ich kann das sehr gut nachvollziehen aber unsere aufgabe ist es m glichst gut abzuschneiden

1311560 es war nicht rainers fehler er hat in wimbledon klasse gespielt und das halbfinale erreicht da war allerdings der stichtag f r die olympia nominierung vorbei es ist auch nicht der fehler des deutschen
1311561 im gro en und ganzen war es ein spiel das wenn es anders l uft auch anders h tte ausgehen k nnen
1311562 ich glaube nicht da wir das spiel verloren h tten wenn es 1 1 ausgegangen w re
1311563 most of the potential for 3g services lies in metro circles and most so in these two cities
1311564 hence it is almost certain that for these circles the ultimate bid price would shoot through the roof and thats a risk the premium that operators in delhi and mumbai would have to pay over the bid price is a major roadblock
1311565 that would translate into unaffordable 3g services for many users
1311566 the decision to charge an additional entry fee from new players for uasl falls in the list of anti competitive policies

1311577 last year many private equity players were clamoring for exposure in india and china but it was hard to get in
1311578 now sellers expectations have come down and what theyre asking for is much more reasonable but the private equity and hedge funds have really pulled back and are more cautious

1311585 the opportunity for agriculture in russia is remarkable it has the potential to be one of the truly key sectors of the economy
1311586 agriculture even with the current low level of efficiency is still a profitable business thanks to government support

1311589 russia was the bread basket of europe 100 years ago the quality of land is exceptional but the neglect of this land during communist times was astounding
1311590 russia has come to the front line of grain exporters
1311591 learning to apply western technology in a russian environment has led to better crops
1311592 the share of imported pork and poultry will go down in future thanks to growing domestic production

1311846 id love to say that a wise mentor told me to do xyz and that it changed my entire career it was much more blas at a career management course for hbs alumni i learned that a person typically gets sick of a job after 18 months this is a natural cycle as you go through the excitement of learning a new job become expert at it and then gradually it gets routine so the advice i got was to plan for job obsolescence every 18 months this didnt mean that i had to leave the company and go to a new place it had more to do with redefining my current job first to incorporate new challenges
1311847 seems that the snubbing of big spaceship by bbdo in regard to the gold cyber lion for the hbo voyeur site is causing a bit of a stir after reading the above two quotes by mr rosenshine from earlier this year it starts to make a little sense when you read the response of bbdos current chairman and cco david lubars it becomes even more clear
1311848 if youre any kind of online publisher a traditional outlet looking to learn about online media or a blog network looking to grow you could do a lot worse than to follow the career of nick denton a former traditional journalist or at least the british version of same who has become a new media mogul thanks to the gawker media network of blogs nick has been conducting a kind of ongoing media workshop for the past couple of years right out in the open more or less in the latest installment the dark lord of the blogosphere has chopped the pay rate for bloggers at gawker for the second time in the last six months

1311852 i attended the talk by the talking lights company at the mit media lab they work on light based communication networks associating information with specific locations in a building and then use that information to guide monitor and get information to people as they move from place to place i was fascinated by their inexpensive way to enable context aware computing and the idea of associating information in a building directly through the components already existing in the building in this case a common light source

1311876 often when companies make products that are comfortable and easy to use by the public interesting applications on the medical side
1311877 anything like that would require approval from the which takes years
1311878 but the possibility is there if simply from a cost standpoint our product is in the hundreds whereas most eeg machines cost between 50 000 and 250 000

1311905 itll only affect ross if ross allows it to affect him
1311906 had i gone out and entertained the article it would have blew the article out of proportion wherever they got their facts or information from let that be what it is you got your story out thank you very much i bow to it and keep it moving now if you wanna entertain it then youre gonna open up more worms you probably dont want opened up so all ross has to do is keep focusing on his music
1311907 the whole purpose of konvict music was to grab ex convicts felons
1311908 people head in that direction and steer them in the opposite direction just focus on my past and try to contradict whatever it is i might have said or lived and dont focus on the positive things ive done in society in general if you have an article at least balance it out let the people know the good things ive done the schools ive built the kids i feed in africa dont just say he wasnt locked up for three years i dont care if i was locked up for one day its that experience that allowed me to become that person who i am to make a better society for who is listening
1311909 people know what type of dude ross is right now
1311910 they know how thorough of a dude he is now he doesnt have to prove himself to anybody thats what an insecure person would do
1311911 when i heard about it i honestly thought to myself some of them correction officers are some of the most crooked individuals whether he did that or not its all what you take from it
1311912 its a lot of crooked cops out there they manipulate the system
1311913 so im just being real when i heard about it either way if he did it if he didnt do it it could still be crooked from it thats what it all comes down to so thats ludacris two cents on the whole rick ross situation to be real with you man if thats how you want to manipulate the system thats how you do it you get in the system there you have it
1311914 the new yorker writer jane mayers new book the dark side the inside story of how the war on terror turned into a war on american ideals reviewed on this weeks cover may be the most uniformly praised nonfiction title of the summer

1311918 but there is mayer persuasively argues little available evidence that torture works and a great deal of evidence from numerous sources including the united states military and the fbi that torture is in fact one of the least effective methods of gathering information and a likely source of false confessions
1311919 at one point the fbi agents collaborating with the cia on interrogation plans were so alarmed by what they were hearing that they urged their superiors to arrest james mitchell who introduced the cia to a secret military program
1311920 there is no happy ending to this sordid and shameful story despite growing political pressure despite supreme court decisions challenging the detainment policy despite increasing revelations of the once hidden program that have shocked the conscience of the world there is little evidence that the secret camps and the torture programs have been abandoned or even much diminished
1311921 jane mayers extraordinary and invaluable book suggests that it would be difficult to find any precedent in american history for the scale brutality and illegality of the torture and degradation inflicted on detainees over the last six years and that it would be even harder to imagine a set of policies more likely to increase the dangers facing the united states and the world
1311922 a cage match between the constitution and a cabal of ideological extremists and the constitution goes down

1311956 the actors are sitting at the table and the woman says whose ring is that and the guy says i dont know its not mine and then i get up from our extras table and say its mine and then i walked over and proposed to jana at first she thought i was messing up the scene then it dawned on her and she started crying and everyone was clapping it was awesome

1311986 did not respond with vigour to reports that a vulnerable person was missing having last been seen in the company of a man who was a known sex offender
1311987 together these aspects should have alerted them sooner to the possibility they were dealing with a potential murder inquiry
1311988 they should have conducted their investigations accordingly until this proved not to be the case
1311989 they initially treated the investigation as a missing person inquiry rather than a possible abduction murder
1311990 however the grounds to arrest this man were available within 48 hours of arlene being reported missing
1311991 his statement to the missing person inquiry included a number of inconsistencies he was on bail for serious sexual offences and had been convicted of a number of sexual crimes these factors should have raised serious concerns for the whereabouts of arlene
1311992 the police did not arrest him until 46 days after the disappearance was reported the failure to do so sooner prevented the seizure of clothing he wore on the night of the disappearance and allowed for the opportunity to dispose of evidence the early seizure and examination of significant exhibits would have had the potential to provide valuable evidence
1311993 i have been sick waiting for this and i was shaking too much to drive the car
1311994 the most important thing for me is still to find arlenes remains thats my first priority

1312005 its enormous very high incredibly steep and much further north than everest which means it attracts notoriously bad weather
1312006 no matter which route you take its a technically difficult climb much harder than everest the weather can change incredibly quickly and in recent years the storms have become more violent people who have recently been there have told me that the snow conditions are also getting worse

1312023 large parts of the media are finally clicking on to the obama scam the vacuity of his comments and his galloping narcissism i dont see how he survives his claim that the surge hasnt worked and yet that he has modified his troops out posture the demise of billary is very heartening obviously after mcgovern carter mondale and dukakis the party of roosevelt truman kennedy and johnson had to go for a winner but they were holding their noses at the antics of the clintons until they got another winner obama isnt so much a winner as someone who relieves the whites of their guilt complex vis a vis the blacks as long as they elect him as the ticket out of their guilt problem this is the core of jesse jacksons objections as he could never get beyond the guilt trip and no one has been listening anyway if mccain keeps his wits about him stays on message and appears to be alive he should win

1312145 by considering and implementing methods of reducing their energy costs many businesses in northern ireland can achieve this and improve their bottom line whilst minimising their impact on the environment
1312146 last year the carbon trust helped companies here to reduce their energy costs by 18 3m a return on investment of over six to one the renewed backing of invest ni will help the carbon trust build on this success and help local businesses to even further improve the productivity of northern ireland as a whole
1312147 will have a dual benefit of lowering energy bills and reducing northern irelands carbon output
1312148 northern ireland has the highest ecological footprint in the uk and the onus is on government business and consumers to do their part to address this high energy costs support the need to increase renewable energy production and we would urge the executive to ensure northern irelands renewable energy potential is being fully exploited for instance research shows that the tides around rathlin have the capacity to produce 10 per cent of the electricity needs of northern ireland
1312149 if there was a competition for the country with the most pessimistic consumers the uk would be the winner
1312150 despite the undoubted pedigree of the competition the uk consumer easily wins the title of the most pessimistic in europe and probably the developed world even us confidence has been more resilient
1312151 not only does the uk win the title for the weakest of the lot it also takes the gold medal for diving the uk index has fallen most from peak to trough bellyflopping from the top diving board compared to irelands commendable performance from the lower three metre springboard

1312193 termination provisions contained in the agreement are the same as for other 66 type agreements
1312194 a concrete result of that would be a comprehensive moratorium by all states that have nuclear weapons not to test at any time in the future until the comprehensive test ban treaty comes into force which i hope will happen soon i hope it will also lead to a moratorium on production of any nuclear material for weapons purposes until we have the fissile material cut off treaty in force

1312196 the board of governors this afternoon adopted by consensus the agreement to apply safeguards to civilian nuclear facilities in india
1312197 i have always maintained that if we were to move forward toward strengthening non proliferation to reduce the nuclear weapons arsenal toward moving to a world free from nuclear weapons that dialogue has to be universal and inclusive
1312198 india committed itself to harmonize its laws on export controls with those of the supplier group that s very important because one of our main goals continues to be that nuclear material will not fall into the wrong hands

1312268 le indagini non hanno sin qui evidenziato situazioni atte a riscontrare incassi diretti di denaro contante in conseguenza delle dazioni effettuate da angelini ma tale circostanza non assolutamente idonea a inficiare lipotesi accusatoria apparendo evidente come la prova della destinazione delle somme di persone operanti nel settore istituzionale non agevole potendo esse contare su rapporti personali che certamente consentono la gestione del denaro anche per interposta persona

1312270 a significant amount of work took place in the vicinity of the crossing to glean vital information which will feed into the design of the bridge and its approach roads
1312271 ground investigations on the north and south side of the forth and ecological surveys have been underway for a number of months the marine investigations are a crucial piece of the jigsaw and as the findings of all of these works come together over the coming months so our plans for the design of the bridge and the location of approach roads will become more defined

1312273 this matter is in the hands of the lawyers so it is inappropriate to make any comment at this stage what we can say though is that for some time ryanair has enjoyed substantial discounts in charges for using stansted airport

1312295 koukl responds to this by saying that statement does not advance the argument its just an opening assertion and has nothing to do with the conclusion post hoc god does not exist
1312296 koukl responded by saying it is natural to assume design when things look like they have been and therefore again this does not advance the argument dawkins is very clear on this point mostly because koukl missed out the second half of this statement we see complex objects that are designed by us for example a watch or computer using this same form of logic we can then assume that in order for humans to exist therefore something more complex than us must have designed us in other words we cannot see that the horseshoe could have made the blacksmith it is not how our experience allows us to think just because something comes to us naturally that does not result in it being true taking an example from another dawkins book the blind watchmaker it is perfectly logical to see a beach where the large stones are set further away from the water and the smaller stones closer to it if you dont understand roughly the ideas of wave power and gravity then how could you assume anything other than someone sorted the stones out to make that pattern just seeing something which appears to be designed does not mean that it has been designed that is just another assumption it advances the argument because it challenges our assumptions of the forces that could have created living things including us and the universe although we currently have no natural explanation for the appearance of design but we should not give up the hope of a better explanation arising in physics as powerful as darwinism is for biology

1312374 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1312375 id like to thank all of you for your support of our troops and heres why im many things in my life and one thing id like to be is your first lady but more importantly im jack mccains mother and jimmy mccains mother one in the u s navy and another one in the marine corps an iraqi vet
1312376 i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip
1312377 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1312378 this election is all about whether barack obama is fit to be president of the united states
1312379 are two major problems he cant do anything about he was born in 1936 and his partys leader george w bush is the most unpopular president in modern history people blame him for everything
1312380 is whether mccains surge is a result of obamas much publicized middle eastern and european trip or just a coincidence while obama was trying to show he could handle world affairs voters were home trying to fill their gas tanks
1312381 the same voters who give bush job approval ratings that are more than 2 to 1 negative want congress to go along with the president on the drilling question
1312382 mccain clearly sees public support for drilling as a means to challenge obamas claim to be the best candidate to fix the economy
1312383 who i expect to be dealing with over the next eight to 10 years
1312384 fresh from his presidential style world tour during which foreign leaders and american generals lined up to show him affection obama settled down to some presidential style business in washington yesterday july 29
1312385 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
1312386 this is the moment the world has been waiting for
1312387 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1312388 pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall
1312389 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day demand met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and bottles of hard to find organic brew black forest berry tea and worry about the price of arugula
1312390 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1312391 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1312392 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1312393 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1312394 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1312395 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1312396 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1312397 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1312398 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1312399 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

1312404 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied the countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of the major media outlets
1312405 could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement he would then target those that voted them in office
1312406 here in the united states unitarians believe that we actually invented american democracy
1312407 thomas jefferson considered himself a unitarian and john adams and john quincy adams were two other early unitarian presidents
1312408 and unitarian universalists have always been prominent in all of the social movements in this country we were prominent in the abolitionist movement and unitarian leaders both men and women were very prominent in the struggle for womens empowerment womens right to vote and so it has continued on to the present day we support the struggle of gay lesbian bisexual and transgender persons so we have been a part of the american democratic tradition since there was one
1312409 unitarian universalism is a faith that is not based on a particular creed
1312410 instead it is grounded in a few deeply held principles first among these principles is the inherent worth and dignity of all people a belief that compels us to speak on important justice issues
1312411 this has been part of our mission since early days it will take time for us to heal but let me reassure you that we will not change our beliefs or compromise our demands for social justice

1312418 she is the only woman in history who has ever garnered this much support
1312419 she is the only woman in history who was able to raise the kind of money one would need to run a presidential campaign
1312420 is now seen as the reigning dean of the womens movement its sort of moses gets all the way to the mountain and doesnt get to the promised land and i think there would be people really angry about that
1312421 the question is going to be raised are you telling me that this person would be a better qualified vice president than hillary clinton
1312422 if he picked claire mccaskill or janet napolitano or kathleen sebelius i think it would annoy women
1312423 those are women who we spent our lifetime helping run for office
1312424 a lot of us are not happy with these women for not supporting hillary because they came to us for help based in large part on their gender
1312425 i would be very concerned about his judgment if he offered the position to another woman before offering it to hillary clinton

1312458 tras esa primera etapa indic la edil se firm una serie de decretos vinculados con una presentaci n ante el ministerio de trabajo por parte de los trabajadores agremiados con el prop sito de acceder a cargos transitorios pero con categor as definitivas del personal
1312459 esto no s lo lo firmaron los presidentes de turno sino que tambi n lo convalid el personal
1312460 se hab a planteado una reuni n con el personal pero no fue convocada por la presidencia del cuerpo
1312461 nos parece que el mbito para discutir este tema es el de paritarias si es necesario que el personal recategorice que se haga dentro de lo que dice el convenio legislativo de empleo
1312462 en ese espacio podremos entonces dictar cada uno de los decretos que corresponda analizando caso por caso que es lo que le corresponde a cada agente si esto correspondiera por supuesto lo acompa amos esto trae un malestar interno que es la manera que nosotros nos enteramos donde unos objetan los decretos de los otros y viceversa
1312463 ni las taqu grafas son parte de esta rea cuando esto tiene que ver totalmente con el rea de parlamentaria

1312490 i have sensed in this country that there is no place for ambiguity the american constitution is clear of course you can have your own religion and of course you can have your own neighborhoods and you can self segregate as much as you wish but there are certain things you have to abide by the most important of which is you feed yourself you work and you have the dignity of living on your own earnings there is also the clarity of law enforcement europe because of all these notions of post modernism and multiculturalism and what have you has decided to treat immigrants as if they were not completely mature citizens as if they were children appeasing and looking away when they commit crimes i havent seen the same thing here im not saying this is a perfect system but it just gives muslims who are looking for clarity that clarity if freedom of expression is protected the way it is in the united states then i think improvements in the lot of muslim women in europe can take a very short time i dont know if it will take 10 years or 100 years but thats the condition to express your ideas freely and to be able to associate with one another and plan to change all of this is not possible if every time one criticises islam one is labelled an islamophobe works are not published intellectuals are ostracized and thats what going on in europe at the moment its no longer the issues that you address but your person that is attacked and the whole debate is brought too a standstill that combined with the terrorists who threaten intimidate and promise jihad is what has made progress for muslims living in europe something harder to achieve than for muslims living in america
1312491 je sens dans ce pays quil ny a pas de place pour lambigu t la constitution am ricaine est claire bien s r vous pouvez avoir votre religion et vivre s par s dans vos quartiers autant que vous voulez mais il y a certaines exigences respecter et la plus importante est celle de vous nourrir vous m mes vous travaillez et vous avez la dignit de vivre de votre propre salaire il y a aussi la clart de la loi leurope en vertu de toutes ces notions de postmodernisme de multiculturalisme etc a d cid de ne pas traiter les immigr s comme des citoyens enti rement m rs comme sils taient des enfants et de fermer les yeux quand ils commettent certains crimes je nai pas constat la m me chose aux etats unis je ne dis pas que le syst me est parfait mais il offre aux musulmans la clart quils demandent si la libert dexpression est prot g e comme elle lest aux etats unis alors je crois quon peut am liorer le sort des femmes musulmanes en europe tr s rapidement je ne sais pas si cela prendra dix ou cent ans mais il ny a pas dautre moyen dy arriver il faut pouvoir exprimer ses id es librement pouvoir sassocier et pr parer le changement cela est impossible si chaque fois quon critique lislam on se fait traiter dislamophobe si les uvres ne sont pas publi es si les intellectuels sont victimes dostracisme et cest ce qui se passe en europe actuellement ce ne sont pas les questions que vous abordez mais les personnes quon attaque et le d bat na pas lieu cest cela conjugu au terrorisme qui menace intimide et pr che le djihad qui rend le progr s pour les musulmans deurope plus difficile que pour les musulmans qui habitent en am rique

1312626 ministers need to tell us what they are doing with this 100m a year taken from motorists how much is actually put back into practical road safety that does not involve speed cameras
1312627 ministers failure to answer that question confirms the view that for this government the british motorist is a nice little earner is labour using speeding tickets just to raise revenue rather than making our roads safer
1312628 the government needs to rethink ways of improving road safety including cracking down on uninsured drivers

1312630 independent research has shown there are 1 745 fewer deaths and serious injuries at camera sites each year

1312899 yes most cars can run on regular but some cars require premium and some drivers insist on using the recommended octane
1312900 it was probably too much of a pain before but with pennies being squeezed it might be worth peoples while to fill half with 89 octane and half with 93 the result is a tankful of 91 for less money
1312901 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1312902 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1312903 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1312904 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1312905 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1312906 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1312907 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1312908 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1312909 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another

1312915 the write downs appear to be under some control certainly compared to its u s peers the open question is will it be enough is there more in the pipeline
1312916 the economy may already be in recession yet the monetary policy committee feels unable to act given that inflation is well above target and rising
1312917 these figures will do nothing to quell fears that the economy is sliding toward negative growth and the prospect of a technical recession looks increasingly likely
1312918 focused too strongly on recovering arrears according to a strict mandate without reference to the borrowers circumstances
1312919 as our data shows in these current market conditions more people are struggling to meet their mortgage payments and it is vital that firms treat them fairly
1312920 people invariably believe that money can make them happy and rich people usually do report being happier than poor people do but if this is the case shouldnt wealthy people spend a lot more time doing enjoyable things than poor people nobel prize winning behavioral economist daniel kahneman has found however that being wealthy is often a powerful predictor that people spend less time doing pleasurable things and more time doing compulsory things and feeling stressed

1312923 people began then to wonder how to interpret solzhenitsyns support for russian president vladimir putin who has been widely seen by the west as an embodiment of the evil solzhetsins patriotic appeals his approval of the war in chechnya and his insistence on death penalties for the terrorists have also been questioned
1312924 people never understood this friendship between a former prisoner and a former kgb officer
1312925 solzhenitsyn was a giant among the heroic dissidents in the soviet union and his saga was a defining episode in the decline of the communist tyranny

1312940 beginning at 1 000 person with dinner and photoline for 15 000 per seat or 28 500 per couple
1312941 about 250 people paid 15 000 each 28 500 for a couple to dine with him afterward
1312942 combined with the democratic national committee obama hopes to have raised 450 million by election day
1312943 in fact 64 high end donors gave almost 1 4 million in chunks of 5 000 or more and and 36 gave 28 500 or more

1312959 jon it seems like you struggle with four different addictions and one of them is religion
1312960 from this point out every bit of culture i engage with will be christian in nature
1312961 it is possible to approach grace as if it were just another thing to be addicted to something we could collect or hoard but this kind of grasping can capture only an image of grace grace itself cannot be possessed it is eternally free and like the spirit that gives it it blows where it will we can seek it and try to be open to it but we cannot control it
1312962 if we do not fill our minds with guilt and self recriminations we will recognize our incompleteness as a kind of spaciousness into which we can welcome the flow of grace

1312970 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1312971 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1312972 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1312973 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1312974 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
1312975 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

1312980 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
1312981 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
1312982 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
1312983 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
1312984 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
1312985 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
1312986 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
1312987 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
1312988 99 of leadership development programs offered by elite business schools are male oriented which is precisely why they fail when it comes to leadership learning for women
1312989 its just a tough environment and they are in the next fiscal year going to feel the brunt in the recent run up in oil and commodity cost
1312990 the air is a serious concern for all the athletes going over there
1312991 you try to find as many natural ways to help as you can
1312992 will we have an edge over other countries that dont wear anything over their mouths perhaps obviously we want to do all that we can to put our athletes in a position to win medals
1312993 id wager times and distance events will be well under previous olympics and that will be proof right there
1312994 youll hear more horror stories when these people who are trying to compete go out there and have trouble and say i just couldnt do it
1312995 you cant get oxygen to the working muscles so it would certainly affect their exercise performance
1312996 hes only 16 hes 17 i think in december and for him to be breaking into the team at that age says a lot for the lad
1312997 hes going to be a good player of that ive no doubt and im sure he can break through this season
1312998 the figures show that organizations havent nailed down the e mail channel
1312999 e mail protection is catching on as a technology that manages information as the industry moves away from protect and defense to becoming more aware how information flows around the organization
1313000 these figures do not surprise me on the whole employees are not sending stuff out maliciously but through carelessness or lack of forethought
1313001 education can help to some extent but many employees are using communications tools all day every day and mistakes will happen so having checks in place makes sense affordability of available technology to tackle the problem is also a problem as most businesses are unable to invest in the high end on premise data leak prevention dlp products that large business can

1313008 niet alleen voor heidegebieden en bossen maar ook in stadsparken en woon en industriegebieden
1313009 there is a sense that because of his unique background and temperament obama lives apart
1313010 he put one foot in the institutions he rose through on his journey but never fully engaged as a result voters have trouble placing him in his context understanding the roots and values in which he is ineluctably embedded
1313011 fantastic powers of observation and his skills as a writer and thinker it means that people on almost all sides of any issue can see parts of themselves reflected in obamas eyes but it does make him hard to place
1313012 i casi sono due o si vara una finanziaria che mette le mani in tasca ai cittadini con nuove tasse come ha fatto il governo prodi che poi caduto dopo solo un anno e mezzo oppure si tagliano le spese inutili i privilegi e gli sprechi come abbiamo fatto noi
1313013 non si riferiscono certo agli agenti che vanno nelle strade siamo stati eletti dalla gente e il governo deve fare dei sacrifici con quel poco che ha daltra parte siamo in una situazione economica in cui il prezzo del petrolio raddoppiato rispetto a un anno fa aumenta il prezzo dei generi alimentari spinto dalla domanda della cina e degli altri mercati aumenta linflazione e crescono i tassi di interesse
1313014 le societ petrolifere cercheranno di rivalersi sui consumatori star a noi vigilare affinch ad essere colpite siano solo le banche e le societ petrolifere
1313015 i tassi di interesse variabili di chi ha contratto un mutuo stanno salendo alle stelle il governo spiega offre ai cittadini la possibilit di rinegoziare con le potentissime banche riportando il tasso al livello del 2006 e spostando nel tempo lo scadenzamento del pagamento nessuno lo dice ma tremonti per la prima volta andato a toccare proprio le potentissime banche
1313016 a napoli prevalso un principio di solidariet generale e tornato lo stato tornato il governo a napoli ha detto bonaiuti tanto vero che gli stessi sindaci di sinistra o gli amministratori provinciali hanno collaborato in una maniera perfetta la posizione di iervolino e bassolino ha sottolineato dimostra che c stata una collaborazione leale tra persone che si trovano ad affrontare unemergenza persone messe ad uno stesso tavolo con lo stesso interesse
1313017 in 58 giorni si riusciti a ripulire la citt dallimmondizia ha detto ma soprattutto tra la gente c il sentimento che lo stato tornato a interessarsi di napoli e della campania zone che troppo a lungo sono state dimenticate
1313018 larrivo dei militari ha dato un aiuto fondamentale per rimuovere la spazzatura ha detto bonaiuti si dimostrato un interessamento nello stabilire che qui va aperta una discarica o un termovalorizzatore perch se i rifiuti non si bruciano ce li troviamo addosso e li dobbiamo mettere nelle discariche

1313022 another major achievement is the completion of a national audit of iks databases hosted by various institutions
1313023 other dynamic initiatives include the establishment of iks research chairs which will be based at our tertiary institutions and they are expected to increase human capital required to conduct research and develop appropriate skills in indigenous knowledge
1313024 most countries still have a long way to go to meet the goal set two years ago at the general assembly to move towards universal access to hiv prevention treatment care and support by 2010
1313025 just as important in most countries stigma against people living with hiv remains a grave challenge
1313026 they are wonderfully courageous and motivated people and should serve as an example to us all on how to act with dignity in the face of adversity
1313027 that they should be discriminated against including through restrictions on their ability to travel between countries should fill us with shame
1313028 this is cause for encouragement but not cause for complacency nor for declaring victory
1313029 because the end of aids is nowhere in sight every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral treatment
1313030 the fact that last year 2 7 million people were newly infected with hiv a disease that is entirely preventable is unacceptable
1313031 lack of information about career choices often leads to young people not making informed decisions about which careers to follow while school leavers become unaware of the opportunities out there that are available for them
1313032 we are delighted to be welcoming the feeling to the regent they represent rock pop at its very best and will undoubtedly perform a fantastic show although please dont complain to us if you cant get the songs out of your head for the next six months
1313033 in recognition of the fact that for shows like these some customers like to queue at the venue we will also be holding back 100 tickets for sale at the box office at the regent theatre when it opens at 9 30am

1313036 i woke up at about 3 30am with a sound like a bomb i looked outside and there were big flames everywhere
1313037 the fire service was here within minutes but they couldnt stop the damage and it was 5 30am by the time they left
1313038 i woke up at about 3am and the car was on fire
1313039 although how long that will take is still unclear but a deal is not far off not at all
1313040 contradict the principles of tolerance inter religious accord and the laws of the republic
1313041 the authorities have been hunting such meetings at least in some parts of the country

1313043 the only freedom our people have in uzbekistan is to meet in one building in chirchik
1313044 by their criminal actions expressed in the renewal of the previously halted activity of the illegal religious organisation of jehovahs witnesses and in their active participation in its activity as an illegal religious organisation
1313045 containing propaganda for the ideology of the illegal jehovahs witness religious organisation
1313046 contradict the principles of tolerance inter religious accord and the laws of the republic of uzbekistan
1313047 thereby showing their indifferent attitude to the fate of the people and country
1313048 in the beginning of the hearing on 16 july those who were called to give testimony against them in fact talked in their favour and judge tojiev appeared to be favourably disposed
1313049 when the hearing continued after some delays next day the judges disposition appeared to have changed as if he had been put under pressure to rule against the witnesses
1313050 further he was hesitant and let the prosecution and police rule the proceedings without following the protocol
1313051 some of them gave false testimonies as they did not even know the defendants and some gave evidence about other witnesses who were not among the defendants
1313052 maybe that is connected with the fact that the court received a petition for amnesty from him and they do not want to act upon this
1313053 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1313054 he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence

1313059 all agile practices help the team learn fast by cycling in every possible practice agile teams accelerate learning addressing the bottleneck of software engineering
1313060 i would suggest that a minority of people had hidden them with the intention of causing harm to police officers and possibly to the horses or dogs that we are using on patrol
1313061 and if you look at the equipment we have seized it is clear to me the plan was to use these items for criminal purposes
1313062 we are very very worried about the intentions of a number of hardcore protesters which we believe are around 150 who are committed to using criminal means to achieve their aims
1313063 they could not predict that in the resort they chose to spend their holidays they could place the life of any of their children in danger

1313066 angelina is devastated over the earthquake that occurred in china in may she has been in constant touch with relief workers as part of her un involvement and even got her hands on photos of a few orphaned kids
1313067 shes made overtures offering a home to one earthquake orphan or even two if they are siblings
1313068 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time shiloh calls the twins her babies she and zahara pick out their clothes help change and hold them its sweet they are like little mommies
1313069 i heard the attack yesterday morning it was not loud it just sounded like a cars tire bursting
1313070 it doesnt seem like there are more police on the streets but the neighborhood patrols seem to be tighter theyre coming around and checking more often
1313071 we are sorry for the incident and the damage to the equipment that belonged to the reporters
1313072 if we just do one thing and regard every person on the streets of our country as our real diamonds not what weve mined underground if we look at the brilliance and genius that sit in our young people and if we love them enough and care enough about them and really actually be sensible about our future we would be putting everything we could into giving those young people the opportunity for a brilliant future
1313073 my hopes and dream for my children is that they will not have limits when it comes to choosing their careers but because they have been exposed to opportunities they will be able to achieve what theyd like to achieve in life
1313074 my hope and my dream for south africa is that we all really see how special this country is and how special our youth is and if we all work together we can create a country that is so wonderful to live in
1313075 through city parks we must give people hope and by giving people hope they start to see opportunities and when the opportunities arise they start becoming inspired and once theyre inspired they become creative and then they start to protect their own

1313111 it is imperative that this statement be clarified and fully understood immediately any implication that exxon mobil corporation some how has veto authority is extremely disconcerting for not only legislators but for many alaskans
1313112 clearly neither exxon mobil nor any other party has a veto over the manner in which the state of alaska deals with its oil and gas assets
1313113 it is a common phrase in the energy sector that nothing goes ahead until exxon is happy my wry observation along those lines was not meant as a negative comment on exxon mobil nor was it meant to imply that exxon mobil has any sort of veto on the building of an alaska gas pipeline

1313119 the britney and paris ad i think will go down in history as one of the most visually incoherent ads ever shown on tv

1313125 heres what landslide provides in the new release a single screen interface that walks its users through the standard tasks that crm fulfills gathering data on customers and leads and then beyond that into a set of processes that guide sales reps all the way through closing the sale
1313126 while the solution comes with a pre set group of processes its also completely customizable so it can fit your organizations way of working and you dont have to impose changes on your staff to fit the software
1313127 its neat for two reasons first of all it brings a wealth of new information to sales people using landslide and it indicates how insideviews information aggregation and evaluation technology is going to become a component of a lot of tools in areas where knowledge of the customer is critical

1313129 to become a market leader they need to change the way enterprise customers look at communications
1313130 as part of the gores joint venture choices can and will be made will sen continue to focus on hosted solutions as they have been doing with their partnership with bt or will sen drive to build on their leadership position in unified communications with the openscape software suite which leverages the powerhouse relationships with microsoft and network upgrades or will sen continue to claw for share in the slow growth large enterprise ip pbx market where they are in the cluster of firms that are losing share to cisco likely we will see sen pick one or at most two of these
1313131 as expected they are using gores turnaround of enterasys as an example
1313132 the turnaround was from dead to irrelevant id hardly boast about that as a success story surely they have something better this is the most press enterasys has had since the late 90s

1313138 on consolidated basis the companys inorganic chemicals business registered a growth of 62 5 to rs 1 270 96 million in q1fy09 from rs 782 1 million in q1fy08 tcls pat however registered a fall of 22 due to the notional loss on exchange rate amounting to rs 1 288 7 million hence the pat margins of the company fell from 12 16 in q1fy08 to 4 88 in q1fy09
1313139 based on the domestic expansion and growth from the subsidiaries especially gcip usa and magadi south africa we maintain a
1313140 recommendation on tata chemicals ltd with a price objective of rs 350 based on a forward p e multiple of 9x
1313141 ten million school children in america have vision conditions that can negatively affect learning
1313142 many parents rely on vision screenings in school to check for eye problems but that isnt enough comprehensive eye exams are necessary to detect problems that a simple screening can miss such as eye coordination moderate amounts of farsightedness and astigmatism
1313143 a childs brain learns how to use eyes to see just like it learns how to use legs to walk or a mouth to form words the longer a vision problem goes undiagnosed and untreated the more a childs brain has to overcompensate to live with the vision problem instead of developing and learning normally
1313144 on the basis of momentum real estate stocks the topline frontline if one buys over the longer term outlook is fine but if one is trying to buying dlf expecting rs 650 over the next couple of weeks or unitech bouncing back to more than rs 200 in the short term thats probably not so likely i think there is some serious problem still there in that sector it has been a great multi bagger for most investors over the last several years and its time for the short perspectives short perspectives at least has come to an end as lot of people stuck in those stocks and they will use any rise to get out there is opportunity for longer term investors but only the frontliners or the blue chip companies
1313145 with autos things still have problem with interest rates i do not take it for granted interest rate cycle at its peak yet the rbi is strong against its fight with inflation and if need be if one sees inflation go up on the officials figure above 13 14 then again one might see some stern action by rbi so these are relieves with the market discounting and expecting that the worse is over in interest rates but thats too early to say whether there will be any certainty just now
1313146 ntpcs net sales registered a growth of 6 5 yoy to rs 9 539 crore rs 8 958 crore which was below our expectations of a 14 5 growth net profit without considering this exceptional item stood at rs 1 757 1 crore rs 1 987 1 crore indicating a dip in profits of 11 6
1313147 we believe at current levels the stock is fairly valued at the cmp the stock is trading at 17 5x fy2009e and 16 1x fy2010e earnings and 2 3x fy2010e p bv we remain neutral on the stock
1313148 nestl s 2qcy08 results were much better than our expectation net profit grew 26 yoy our estimate of 17 driven by strong sales growth of 24 yoy higher other income and a lower tax rate ebitda margin however contracted by 79bps because of higher ad spends and rising raw material costs tax rate was lower due to higher production shifting to backward areas we believe nestl is well positioned to leverage the growth in processed foods to deliver an earnings cagr of 24 over cy07 10 recommend add strong growth in the indian processed foods market nestl s well entrenched products in high growth categories and constant product improvement will drive earnings cagr of 24 over cy07 10 for nestle as against 15 over cy04 07 any easing in commodity prices will lead to upsides in margins and hence our earnings estimates
1313149 suzlon reported consolidated sales of rs 27 6 billion up 42 yoy and pat of rs 1 65 billion excluding mtm losses of rs 1 64 billion for 1qfy09 both were significantly higher than our estimates mainly due to better than expected growth and higher profitability in the wind business with ramp up in hansens gearbox production capacity revenue from the gearbox business rose 58 yoy in 1qfy09 and accounted for 28 of suzlons total revenue in the quarter opm on gearboxes expanded to 14 from 7 a year ago consequently contribution of this business to operating profit rose to 26 from 19 a year ago details inside although wtg sales volumes rose only 7 yoy to 338mw average per mw realisation rose 16 yoy to rs 54 3m mw gross margin also rose to rs 21m mw from rs 15 3m mw a year ago management attributed the increase to 1 improvement in the product mix 2 favourable currency impact inr depreciated against usd eur and aud and 3 project work almost 70 of the yoy increase in the quarters operating profit came from the wind business
1313150 suzlon has an order book of 3 039mw formed mostly of international deliveries its order book has stagnated over the last few quarters as it has been unable to increase share of international deliveries we maintain our fy09ii and fy10ii estimates as we believe that 1 the current order book is sufficient to secure fy09 revenues 2 the company has more than 6 8 months to grow its international order book for fy10 and 3 the rupee remains weak against usd and euro
1313151 driven by a strong 26 realisation growth jsw reported 54 growth in revenues higher than our estimates profits rs 2 1 billion were lower than our estimates primarily on account of forex loss of rs 3 6 billion we were building in rs 0 5 billion adjusted for forex loss earnings for the quarter stood at rs 4 3 billion way ahead of our and consensus estimates us operations reported significant improvement in earnings with 1qfy09 ebidta at usd 45 million from usd 30 million in 4qfy08 companys 6 8mnpta expansion project is progressing well and will be commissioned in september 2008 the company expects production of iron ore from chile and coking coal to start in fy10 we remain positive on jsw steel given 25 volume cagr over fy08 12ii and improving cost structure on account of captive raw material production at a per of 6 9x fy09ii and ev ebidta of 4 9 valuations are attractive retain add
1313152 yesterday hcl technologies performed pretty well and today i would say that now that it has moved up i dont know whether going long at this juncture would actually result in good profits or not but overall if somebody is holding on one should watch for the prices of around rs 242 to rs 245 range if it were to sustain above that then further upswing would be likely but i wont be able to give a buy call at current juncture
1313153 the companys performance during 1qfy2009 was broadly in line with our expectations for 1qfy2009 the company posted net sales of rs 685 7 crore registering a yoy growth of 22 3 robust sales growth along with expansion of opms aided net profit to surge 21 3 during the quarter to rs 89 7 crore this was broadly in line with our expectation of rs 90 4 crore
1313154 further the jv with hospira is expected to have profits equivalent to nycomed by fy2010 excluding any upsides from the jvs and factoring in a decline in profitability of nycomed we expect the company to post a cagr growth of 24 in net profit over fy2008 10e we maintain a buy on the stock with a 15 month target price of rs 450
1313155 it is essential that individuals and companies who carry out work on chimneys adhere to the guidance given including the gas safety installation and use regulations 1998 to stop instances like this from happening again
1313156 community recreation and parks is the health provider that you dont know about
1313157 traditionally these agencies are considered as organizers of games and sports in a towns parks or ball fields but our study shows that 9 out of 10 recreation and park professionals are actively involved in a health partnership sometimes several of them
1313158 twenty years ago health care providers didnt consider recreation and park professionals to be a partner in the campaigns to promote health but in the 1990s community based health partnerships were starting to consider the role of recreation and parks in promoting physical activity and quality of life since many related programs are offered by recreation and park managers
1313159 health campaigns naturally involve recreation and park departments because they provide low cost close to home opportunities for physical activity such as trails recreation centers outdoor courts and outdoor swimming facilities
1313160 parks trails and recreation centers can also serve as settings for physical rehabilitation
1313161 having facilities is critical but then programs also have to be established to bring in residents and encourage them to take part
1313162 partnerships that include after school programs diet and nutritional information and policy efforts to promote recreational settings should be encouraged
1313163 the study was designed to provide baseline information on the state of current health partnership practices within the profession their successes and their challenges
1313164 such information can be used to help a community effectively develop a program in health and physical activity promotion
1313165 the panel found that haywoods misconduct constitutes a serious departure from the relevant standards set out in the nmc code of professional conduct he showed a flagrant disregard for the safety well being and dignity of vulnerable patients he has undermined confidence in the profession and is a continuing danger to patients and clients they consider that confidence in the profession would be undermined if the registrant were not struck off
1313166 children who experience hostility abuse physical discipline and other aggressive behaviors by their parents are more likely to model that behavior in their peer relationships
1313167 children learn from their parents how to behave and interact with others
1313168 so if theyre learning about aggression and angry words at home they will tend to use these behaviors as coping mechanisms when they interact with their peers
1313169 has served as one of the primary contributors to its persistence and severity
1313170 each year hundreds of the nations top publishers corporations universities and nonprofit organizations compete for these prestigious publications awards winning two awards in one year is a true achievement
1313171 i am delighted that the home office has seen sense and reversed their decision unison funded arnels fight to remain in the uk as we firmly believed he and his son zac had the right to build the family life they had planned before mayras tragic death
1313172 this is fantastic news and my client is obviously delighted he is financially solvent and keen to contribute greatly to a society that wanted him before his wife was killed
1313173 arnel will be so relieved that common sense seems to have finally prevailed and the home office have exercised their discretion appropriately
1313174 i am so glad that my application was finally granted and i would like to thank everyone who has supported me i look forward to the day when zac and i can continue our lives here in england as we planned before mayras death
1313175 this case should not have happened and i hope other hospitals will be able to learn from the bitter lessons we have learnt
1313176 in most cases we found that the parent or other adult responsible for supervising the child simply was not present when the injury occurred
1313177 young children need nearly constant supervision and of course thats not always possible but it should be the parents highest priority many infants died because parents placed them in an unsafe sleep environment parents may not be aware of whats safe and what isnt especially with so much new information being released about safe sleeping environments for infants in other cases parents failed to use mandated safety devices such as car seats or the adult was present when the injury occurred but could not protect the child because they were under the influence of drugs or alcohol
1313178 what we know is that these injuries can be prevented
1313179 the importance of intervention is huge recognizing at risk families can help care providers take proper action nurses and other health care providers often encounter families with young children but there isnt enough time to address all aspects of child care with every single family care providers can use these findings to identify high risk families and provide them with specific information or referrals
1313180 household composition and fatal unintentional injuries related to child maltreatment
1313181 job growth matters but only if you could get it where jobs are needed the most we found that jobs had a bigger impact on reducing poverty in smaller metropolitan areas because if you live in a small area you can get to where the jobs are but if you live in columbus or cleveland or new york or atlanta it is going to be harder to get to the jobs
1313182 many lower skilled workers are single mothers with children who dont have reliable transportation their kids get sick so they miss a couple of days of work and then they get fired so finding ways of breaking down this kind of barrier so they can work can really make a difference
1313183 you tend to find out about jobs from your friends coworkers and neighbors but if you live in an area that is downtown and the jobs are being created out in the suburbs it will be more difficult to find out what jobs are available
1313184 in some suburbs there are particular kinds of zoning that make it difficult to create affordable housing lot size requirements and zoning that keeps out apartments puts limits on where people can move if they have limited resources all of these three barriers public transportation information about new jobs and housing barriers keep the people from low income households from getting the jobs that are available far from home
1313185 the discovery of a potential new antibiotic is an exciting advance it could mean a possible novel treatment for people with chronic wounds that are infected with mrsa or other bugs by developing the pure antibiotic into a formula such as a cream it could reduce the contact patients need to have with live maggots to heal wounds it could also offer a potential treatment such as an injection or pill for internal infections like c difficile
1313186 it has been a huge team effort to get to this level and i am delighted with our progress however there is more to do if we are to realise the maximum benefits from this discovery
1313187 maggots are great little multi taskers they produce enzymes that clean wounds they make a wound more alkaline which may slow bacterial growth and finally they produce a range of antibacterial chemicals that stop the bacteria growing
1313188 this is what the nhs should be about providing seamless patient centred care within a defined budget with measurable clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction
1313189 our analysis of these aspects of workplace behavior reveals that women and men co mingle etiquette and emotion maintenance to be accepted in the workplace and to fit white expectations
1313190 this emotional overtime in the workplace strengthens race ethnic group solidarity
1313191 a crucial part of black womens self presentation in work and social public spaces
1313192 keep your n in check african american women and the interactive effects of etiquette and emotional labor
1313193 www formyodds com is such a breakthrough because it predicts the take home baby rate using population based data
1313194 stated simply if one hundred women with similar clinical characteristics underwent an ivf cycle using 1 2 or 3 embryos a certain number will give birth of those who give birth a certain percentage will give birth to twins knowing these percentages can help with many planning aspects such as the timing of treatment
1313195 this is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for women contemplating ivf the site predicts the take home baby rate and multiple birth rate two important rates to know
1313196 formyodds com pools all the variables together in a manner that is meaningful for the fertility doctor cost effective and immediately useful for counseling
1313197 this is an aid to patients considering ivf but not a substitute for a medical diagnosis

1313209 we are scared that after this things may be even harder for uighurs

1313213 weapons were similar to those captured by police from an east turkestan terror camp in january 2007
1313214 we urge international society to put pressure on china to freely let journalists report from kashgar and deal with the issue legally and not go after innocent uighurs
1313215 we cant rule out that this was the work of a few east turkestan supporters within the country who have links to external terrorist forces
1313216 east turkestan terrorist forces are the most direct and most real terror threat to the beijing olympic games
1313217 but we do know the crackdown in xinjiang especially ahead of the olympics has increased discontent among uighurs

1313222 seeing animals slaughtered to be worn as fashion is awful to me so im definitely against wearing fur id much rather go naked than ever put a dead animal on my body

1313224 official numbers should be out by friday we want to be sure on this one
1313225 i guess the supreme court will have to rethink its decision on this because it can effectively kill the peace process
1313226 if we would do this all over again what government must do is to bring everyone in the loop meaning to say the supreme court and congress because the philippine government commits the whole state and not just the executive
1313227 i guess the supreme court made a decision based on the submissions and did not have the benefit of full briefing on the security political economic implications if this moa ad is not signed
1313228 sub state for the bangsamoro in a defined territory in southern
1313229 theres really no irreparable damage or injury that needs to be prevented as to justify the issuance of the tro by the supreme court
1313230 the most important thing to remember is that what the moa ad commits with respect to the areas wherein zamboanga montesa said there were consultations with various stakeholders in montesa said the term of the malaysian led international monitoring team imt will terminate on august 31 and if there is no progress in the peace talks the rest of the imt might follow the malaysians and pull out after august 31
1313231 basically the ball is in the governments hands and this is internal to the grp
1313232 because as far as the milf is concerned this is a done deal already and what was scheduled today was a merely a formal ceremony to celebrate the signing of the moa ad
1313233 to seek constitutional change and reform e g shift to federalism has not been usually treated as unconstitutional except it seems when it has to do with the moro question
1313234 frame a qualitatively better and higher degree of self determination for the bangsamoro people short of independence or secession
1313235 these are peace negotiations not surrender negotiations between two sides which simply have different frameworks if not world views
1313236 let us face it this constitution has outlived its usefulness with regards to the bangsamoro peoples problem and the conflict in
1313237 it is essential to lay the foundation of the bangsamoro homeland in order to address the bangsamoro peoples humanitarian and economic needs as well as their political aspirations

1313257 there are huge costs associated with adding an emr system the major players nextgen cost a ton of money and manpower to implement practice fusion on the other hand is free browser based and has a relatively low barrier to entry
1313258 please stop calling patients consumers patients are people with illnesses or injuries who need medical care consumers are people who purchase goods or services and are informed about what theyre purchasing most patients are not actively dictating what health care resources theyre consuming note there are certainly consumers of health information but a person who comes to me seeking medical attention is not a consumer he or she is a patient
1313259 the patient controls who sees the information in their medical record but the patients physician controls the actual information
1313260 dietary intake and nutritional education dine for latino migrant farmworkers
1313261 migrant workers have a low level of food security that is the lack of well balanced food choices readily available at all times to maintain a healthy life
1313262 this can happen seasonally when agricultural work ends or when money runs out at the end of the month
1313263 theres a tradition in archaeology of saying people dont move very much they just transfer ideas through space
1313264 we know that humans had to migrate at some point in their history but we also know humans tend to stay put once they get someplace
1313265 all of a sudden with genetics you can actually address that question
1313266 africa has the most genetic diversity in the world but it is one of the least studied places
1313267 ive always felt like there were a lot of stories there that nobodys had the time or interest to look into
1313268 the family tree of the y chromosome is very very clear
1313269 i like the fact that the linguistic genetic and archaeological evidence all line up
1313270 when you see lines of evidence converge on a single model it means thats probably something that actually happened
1313271 so rarely do we get to pin down the questions raised by archaeology
1313272 recent clinical findings highlight the relationship between controlling acute blood pressure and lower risk of adverse outcomes
1313273 with the approval of cleviprex physicians have a new treatment option for intensive control of blood pressure that may advance the standard of care in the operating room the intensive care unit and the emergency department
1313274 in the last decade there have been no new iv antihypertensive agents introduced to the market
1313275 cleviprex presents physicians with a valuable option to effectively treat a broad array of patients who need rapid and precise blood pressure control
1313276 with the approval of cleviprex the medicines company continues to deliver on its vision of advancing innovation in the critical care setting
1313277 this would mean that we could deliver lower dosages of drugs to specific cells and tissues in the body and actually be more effective in treating the cancer
1313278 the long rod shaped structure of bacteria may help explain why print particles of higher aspect ratios are internalized more rapidly and effectively than lower aspect ratio particles
1313279 if we can design particles that rely on the same mechanisms that nature has perfected for bacteria we may unlock the key for delivering therapeutics more efficiently and effectively to treat and cure disease
1313280 we are delighted to contribute to the important work that professor desimone and his students are undertaking in the field of nanomedicine this work answers key questions about the role of particle shape and size that industry leaders have been asking for some time
1313281 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1313282 at these high injected doses we hoped to see drug like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment
1313283 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1313284 clinical and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the past 12 years showed that oral ascorbate levels in plasma and tissue are tightly controlled in the case series ascorbate was given orally and intravenously but in the trials ascorbate was just given orally it was not realized at the time that only injected ascorbate might deliver the concentrations needed to see an anti tumor effect
1313285 nihs unique translational environment where researchers can pursue intellectual high risk out of the box thinking with high potential payoff enabled us to pursue this work
1313286 design and cloning of an shrna into a lentiviral vector
1313287 in vitro assays for the extracellular matrix protein regulated extravasation process
1313288 its hard to tell parents how to interact with their children based on one study but what we see here is that parents who have a propensity for being verbally aggressive have a tendency to try to direct and control their children during a play period
1313289 as a result these children were less cooperative and not only are parents setting up situations that are challenging for them to handle but they also are subtly undermining their childs self esteem
1313290 of course all parents direct their children and people in general are always directing others to close a door or hand them something
1313291 its something we do all the time but there is a qualitative difference in the kinds of directing going on by these verbally aggressive mothers by looking at how and when directives occurred not just how often we found that moms who scored highest on verbal aggression used directives to control the child and ultimately the way the game or activity was played the aggressive action is not overt as in a parent hitting or yelling but these small negative maneuvers can say so much to a child
1313292 we all say things to our children that we regret saying but saying a lot of things that attack a childs self confidence is not healthy
1313293 these parents were in an unstructured low stress environment and if we saw this behavior in such a brief setting how could such negative interactions even so subtle affect a child over the long term for example if the parents always have to control what activity they and their children are going to play as well as for how long and how they are going to play it you wonder if this communicates to the child that what they want to do doesnt matter
1313294 this new tool offers a google maps like view of integrative genomic data
1313295 it brings together different kinds of genomic data into a single holistic view im incredibly proud of our computational scientists for responding so rapidly and effectively to the critical needs of the growing genomics research community
1313296 other tools offer detailed localized views of genomic data and a few tools are equipped to provide a whole genome view
1313297 igv was designed to integrate both and to provide smooth zooming and panning across all resolution scales
1313298 most visualization tools are limited in their ability to handle multiple types of genomic data and are typically retrofitted to accommodate new data types as they have arisen
1313299 igv was designed from the ground up to integrate all of these data and to provide a strong platform for future growth and refinement
1313300 before i was introduced to igv i had to use three different programs to visually integrate my data
1313301 but now this one universal browser allows me to rapidly scan the entire genome and identify promising regions which has revolutionized my work
1313302 this tool is designed to enable researchers to view many types of genomic data especially those relevant to human disease
1313303 were particularly excited about its already groundbreaking use in ongoing studies of the cancer genome
1313304 we have suspected for a long time that these virulence proteins had some way of slipping inside plant cells to suppress immunity our findings finally nail down that mechanism and enable us to focus on how to block the entry mechanism
1313305 the finding that virulence proteins from oomycetes and the malaria parasite plasmodium use the same entry mechanism means that we may be able to use the same or similar drugs to block infection by both groups of pathogens this type of approach may also be relevant to other groups of pathogens such as fungi which we also suspect of slipping virulence proteins into host cells
1313306 the double barreled gene gun enabled us to make much more accurate measurements of the avr1b protein than were previously possible which made it practicable to measure the action of the rxlr and deer motifs
1313307 physicians should use esas with caution based on the international guidelines for esa administration in cancer and on certain prognostic indicators to guide their use physicians need to identify the appropriate group of cancer patients who will benefit from esa administration while avoiding possible detrimental effects

1313313 ive already had an hour and a half i mean
1313314 i was an early bloomer and i remember at the age of 11 being very uncomfortable walking past large groups of black men well male teenagers theyd always yell things at me or whistle or walk next to me not saying all black guys do this but on the whole black men are much more vocal with their flirtation and when i was young i really didnt know how to handle it i think this informed my early proclivity for white boys
1313315 michelle check out colorado governor bill ritters oops this morning on the mike rosen show hour two www 850koa com when asked about rumors that he was on the list as a vice presidential candidate he remarked not quoting that his 18 months of gubernatorial experience were insufficient to be considered for vice president when asked to compare this to obamas 143 days of experience in the senate he quickly changed the subject
1313316 well just because i think there are a lot of things that he has to take into consideration
1313317 governor you said 18 months experience wasnt enough experience as governor to be the vice president would you want to contrast that with the 143 days experience obama as senator before he decided he had enough experience to be president
1313318 for many men the first symptom of heart problems is sudden death
1313319 its beyond the time that we change the business as usual in harrisburg
1313320 if these bonusgate allegations are true our state government is broken
1313321 we need a break from the past we must enact real change for the people of pennsylvania
1313322 bill deweese doesnt have the publics trust and we need leaders that do have that trust
1313323 unfortunately this scandal has cast a cloud over our efforts to reform harrisburg
1313324 they wouldnt realize it but the current would be pulling them toward the rocks before they would know it they would be drowning each other trying to stay above water
1313325 as they came into the park we were telling them there was no swimming today
1313326 it is never a safe practice to swim into a rip current even to save someone else
1313327 we have lost many people in the waters throughout michigan who were trying to save a friend or patron who then lost their lives also
1313328 as soon as the coast guard left they went back in
1313329 we got one child out of there and an hour later we saw her again
1313330 special events may be permitted within the north and south city parking lots heritage square and the adjacent parking lot main avenue between elm street and church street and elm street between cherry street and washington avenue preference will be given to special events held on side streets between cherry and washington streets rather than main avenue
1313331 wearing casa on our jerseys is a great way of getting the word out there to help children
1313332 we wanted to get the word out about the casa program and also help recruit more men to become casa defensemen
1313333 its very important for us to get the word out there about what were trying to accomplish
1313334 thats why we need more volunteers especially men right now we only have six men compared to 28 females working with casa were out to target more men to serve as role models
1313335 they take them out for ice cream or to the park this might give some kids some opportunities they did not have at home
1313336 tu es une fille g niale vraiment sympa et tas un joli visage tu trouveras quelquun de bien
1313337 when children consume a high fat high sugar meal their bodies will crash and they will be come very tired and lethargic which is not going to help them perform at their best level in school
1313338 when you are grocery shopping keep in mind that if a snack is in the home your children will likely eat it so keep healthy food in the house at all times to ensure that they will always have healthy snack options if you keep candy bars and fruit in the home most children would pick the candy bar so just keep it out of the house
1313339 a smart dinner will help your childs brain function if they are satisfied after dinnertime then they will sleep through the night and a child needs at least eight to nine hours of sleep a night in order to function while in school the next day
1313340 childhood is a crucial time when bodies are growing and brains are developing
1313341 its so important to fuel the body with good nutrition and teaching children smart eating habits at a young age is a great idea it starts with the parents serving as the role model
1313342 in the last two weeks there has been specific intelligence of a threat to prince harry
1313343 of course given the source and the princes status as a serving army officer who has seen active service in afghanistan it is being treated seriously every precaution is being taken
1313344 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk
1313345 there are british passport holders who live in the uk being found in places like kandahar
1313346 there are very small numbers of british citizens traveling out there being trained up and then returning to the uk
1313347 dispatched terrorists to a number of locations including spain and the united kingdom
1313348 there are british passport holders who live in the u k who are being found in places like kandahar
1313349 while my troops have not actually found british passports on enemy dead there has been a suspicion that with the high number of taliban casualties they have needed to recruit a lot of foreign fighters and some of these are likely to be of british muslim descent
1313350 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk
1313351 this is something the military understands but the british public does not
1313352 there are very small numbers of british citizens traveling out there being trained up and then returning to the uk
1313353 dispatched terrorists to a number of locations including spain and the united kingdom
1313354 i reached the conclusion that i did not want to leave my family any more for an extended period life is too short there is no point having a family if you are not going to see them
1313355 would be up for a fight but we were surprised at how ferocious that fight turned out to be
1313356 if we do not win against the protagonists of the september 11 attacks then those who are against us will take great succour from it
1313357 i cant even remember who told me but apparently you did

1313361 getting pregnant is a challenge for transplant patients because the drugs they take to prevent rejection of their new organ are not safe for pregnancy
1313362 a successful pregnancy is quite a milestone for anyone who has received a transplant
1313363 it was a regimented process and we were overly diligent
1313364 julieanne and i spoke almost every day she was so confident that we would succeed that she began buying baby clothes and nursery furniture
1313365 we want to make sure her liver lasts an entire lifetime
1313366 julieanne only has to visit our clinic once a year but needs to get her labs done every month my biggest job now is to keep reminding her to do that

1313374 if pete worked here for about a month maybe he can gain a little speed
1313375 they cant find workers to do these jobs even in a state like michigan
1313376 it just shows tourism is one of the pillars that keeps michigan going
1313377 theres a lot of jobs that are just created by small to medium sized businesses
1313378 h aving my whole family there was a huge bonus with the kiddos being so little and busy

1313400 it simply does not need to be the case that londoners cannot have access to locally produced top quality food but we have to have a radical rethink to find ways to make this happen
1313401 it is my mission now to help find and deliver these solutions for the capitals homes and businesses
1313402 rosie is as passionate as i am about the importance of locally produced affordable food to our health and well being as well as the role food can play in protecting our environment

1313426 we carefully reviewed the available evidence to measure the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer and could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1313427 at this point we recommend that men concerned about prostate cancer talk with their health care providers to make a decision based on their individual risk factors and personal preference
1313428 this sensor doesnt resemble any other light sensors previously discovered
1313429 that doesnt mean shining an ultraviolet light on people in wheelchairs will suddenly allow them to walk
1313430 but it does give us a tool that we can use to solve the mysteries of nerve cell communication and could ultimately help us understand the biology of everything from sleep and memory to depression
1313431 the new work from ken millers lab has identified a new way that organisms can sense light distinct from the previously known light sensing mechanism used in the eye
1313432 it will be interesting to see whether the lite 1 light sensing mechanism will also lead to new insights into human sensory perception
1313433 without signals from this network neurons cannot talk to each other or to muscle cells to produce movement so the mutants just lie paralyzed on the culture plate even if you poke and prod them
1313434 when you are only a few cells thick getting a sunburn is fatal
1313435 were a long way from any treatments based on this research but i think weve opened up a door that we didnt know was there before
1313436 theres a lot of work left to be done but im excited to see where this discovery leads us
1313437 clinical decision making and the counselling of patients relatives but it must be remembered that their outcomes apply to populations and so great caution is needed if applying them to individual patients
1313438 provided extensive evidence on the efficacy of most drug regimens currently in use for uncomplicated malaria which was often used for treatment policy changes by the concerned countries
1313439 as part of their mandate medical ngos should be prepared to fill gaps in evidence including evaluating current tools to control tropical diseases in hard to reach populations and demonstrating the effectiveness of alternatives
1313440 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1313441 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1313442 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1313443 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight and even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first
1313444 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1313445 one of our goals is to forge strong relationships within the game industry extending our brand in the united states
1313446 curse with its established roots within the core mmorpg audience is a perfect partner for ikariam and our upcoming games
1313447 we believe that gameforge titles are ideal for mmo players who are dedicated to one or more hardcore mmorpgs
1313448 ikariam with its play at your own pace approachability and strong in game community is perfect for gamers who have few minutes to spare while crafting or waiting for their party to arrive
1313449 the significance of this is for other groups of patients with neurological impairment
1313450 do all of these patients have the same mechanism for reflux and swallowing disorders if not performing a fundoplication anti reflux surgery may not help in fact it may make things worse like it did in the rett girls
1313451 this issue is of particular interest to pediatricians who refer these patients for their reflux problems
1313452 if we develop a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the problems being experienced by these children we just might be able to find a way to make life a little more comfortable for them
1313453 were small and were best explained by common genetic factors with opposite effects on exercise behavior and symptoms of anxiety and depression
1313454 in genetically identical twin pairs the twin who exercised more did not display fewer anxious and depressive symptoms than the co twin who exercised less
1313455 it is unknown which genes might be involved in voluntary exercise behavior and in the risk for anxiety and depression
1313456 only voluntary leisure time exercise is influenced by genetic factors whereas the other type of exercise directed and monitored by someone else is environment driven the absence of causal effects of voluntary exercise on symptoms of anxiety and depression does not imply that manipulation of exercise cannot be used to change such symptoms
1313457 the antidepressant effects of exercise may only occur if the exercise is monitored and part of a therapeutic program
1313458 yet despite the traditional prominence of psychotherapy in psychiatric practice and training there are indications of a recent decline in the provision of psychotherapy by u s psychiatrists a trend attributed to reimbursement policies favoring brief medication management visits rather than psychotherapy and the introduction of newer psychotropic medications with fewer adverse effects
1313459 this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement increases in managed care and growth in the prescription of medications
1313460 psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients had fewer managed care visits and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often
1313461 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
1313462 a key challenge facing the future generation of psychiatrists will likely involve maintaining their professional role as integrators of the biological and psychosocial perspectives while working within the constraints of the strong market forces of third party payers and managed care to implement advances in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders
1313463 patriots vortex active cooling fan is the perfect way to help keep your memory operating at optimal performance heat is a major enemy when it comes to high performance overclocking memory
1313464 by adding airflow directly over the memory vortex can lower module temperatures up to 30 this means potentially higher performing memory with increased stability for running todays complex multi threaded applications which require high bandwidth low latency memory
1313465 because of a dramatic increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity and diabetes mellitus during the past two decades physical activity has assumed an increasingly prominent role in disease prevention and health promotion efforts in the united states and is considered one of the 10 leading health indicators for the nation
1313466 it is important to know how patterns of physical activity inactivity and sedentary behaviors for this increasing segment of the population differ from those of the majority native population
1313467 physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors varied widely among children in various ethnic immigrant groups
1313468 for example 22 5 percent of immigrant hispanic children were physically inactive compared with 9 5 percent of u s born white children with u s born parents
1313469 they were however less likely to watch television three or more hours per day than native children although the nativity gap narrowed with increasing acculturation levels
1313470 given the health benefits of physical activity continued higher physical inactivity and lower activity levels in immigrant children are likely to reduce their overall health advantage over u s born populations during adulthood
1313471 to reduce disparities in childhood physical activity health education programs designed to promote physical activity should target not only children from socially disadvantaged households and neighborhoods but also children in immigrant families
1313472 as adults early maturing girls demonstrate lower academic and occupational achievement and report lower relationship quality and life satisfaction
1313473 it is thus important to identify protective factors that may mitigate negative effects of early maturation on girls adjustment
1313474 also early maturation only predicted physical aggression when combined with low maternal nurturance
1313475 parental nurturance may decrease girls susceptibility to negative peer influence
1313476 also parental nurturance may help girls cope with challenges associated with early puberty by listening to their daughters difficulties and providing support and encouragement nurturing parents can help them develop better coping skills and diffuse negative emotions that might otherwise manifest as aggression
1313477 by discussing difficult peer situations e g provocation peer pressure and ways of dealing with them parents may help their daughters develop a repertoire of adaptive responses that will minimize the need for inappropriate i e aggressive behavior
1313478 in addition knowing how their daughters spend free time may help parents identify and prevent negative peer and other influences
1313479 helping parents develop positive parenting skills may help early maturing girls to grow into healthy well adjusted adolescents and adults
1313480 identified molecular mechanisms involved in the evolution of human cognitive abilities by combining biological data from two research directions evolutionary and medical
1313481 our new research suggests that schizophrenia is a by product of the increased metabolic demands brought about during human brain evolution
1313482 our brains are unique among all species in their enormous metabolic demand if we can explain how our brains sustain such a tremendous metabolic flow we will have a much better chance to understand how the brain works and why it sometimes breaks
1313483 at a time when life saving medications are available to treat persons living with hiv there continues to be a population of hiv positive people who have fallen through the cracks
1313484 frequently their only contact with the healthcare system is during a hospitalization
1313485 we know that not being engaged in care and prevention services is not only bad for the individuals but is also bad for society in that a substantial fraction of hiv infected crack users engage in behavior that transmits the virus to others
1313486 hospitals like grady and jackson are doing the best they can in the face of a persistent problem with limited resources
1313487 more needs to be done to address substance abuse and mental health in this population
1313488 we may think we live in a fast moving hectic world but statistically our environment moves around us slowly
1313489 when an object moves quickly be it a football cricket ball or for our ancestors a spear our brains have to interpret the movement rapidly and because our brains draw on experience its often biased by what it already knows the less certain we are about what we see the more we are influenced by the brains statistical assumptions which means in some circumstances we get it wrong
1313490 although it is not surprising that sportsmen who practice a lot build up a better statistical picture in their minds about where a ball might go it is surprising that what should be a vital survival skill is based on such a trial and error learning experience
1313491 the research also has important long term application to robotics and assistive technologies capitalising on natures design is a good way of building artificial visual systems for robots as humans get visual judgments right a lot more often than the best current robot systems further knowing the situations in which humans get it wrong is a useful starting point for the design of assistive devices to help correct those errors before they have serious consequences
1313492 we may think we live in a fast moving hectic world but statistically our environment moves around us slowly

1313496 our long term goal should be to alter our lifestyle accordingly beginning in infancy or early childhood
1313497 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy 7 months is perfectly safe without adverse effects
1313498 our review of the literature convinces us that more aggressive and earlier intervention will probably prevent considerably more than 30 of coronary heart disease
1313499 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30 why not nip things in the bud
1313500 the weapons for those wars education and behavior modification are the same as those needed for a war on coronary heart disease
1313501 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1313502 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1313503 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people
1313504 if all incompatible donors and recipients were simply listed in one common pool the problems related to incompatible and poorly matched donors and recipients would be a thing of the past
1313505 newyork presbyterian weill cornell introduced the registry to ucla a few months ago prompting ucla to join the innovative program
1313506 this is a rare instance of a living donor kidney being shipped across the country to initiate a chain
1313507 if we can become comfortable shipping living donor kidneys like we do with deceased donor kidneys then thousands of patients will have the opportunity to receive a kidney who otherwise would have been forced to remain on dialysis
1313508 the hope is that this marks the first of many such collaborations among the nations transplant centers
1313509 donor chains have enormous potential to expand the donor pool and to provide better matched organs for the many individuals who are in desperate need of lifesaving transplants
1313510 kidney donor chains could have a significant impact on the countrys organ donor shortage
1313511 whereas the chain involves an extra donor in the beginning so you can initiate a self propagating cascade
1313512 but in this case ucla received a live donor kidney from new york which hasnt been done before
1313513 living donor exchange represents the pinnacle of teamwork and professional and personal trust and good faith that ideally epitomizes the organ transplant endeavor
1313514 the team consists of surgeons physicians nurses coordinators patients and donors all working together toward the same goal
1313515 patients can wait up to eight years for a deceased donor transplant
1313516 this donor chain may enable hundreds of patients to receive a kidney thanks to one generous altruistic donor rather than in the past where only one patient benefited from an altruistic donor this could significantly decrease the waiting list for kidney transplantation
1313517 i have had the incredibly sad experience of having a colleague die while waiting for a kidney transplant
1313518 i have a close friend who donated a kidney to her brother and i have a close friend who received a kidney more than a decade ago and i see the terrific experiences shes had since
1313519 when i started thinking about it i thought im able and healthy at this point in my life to do this to help someone have more years of a better life why not donate the beauty of this partnership between excellent doctors transplant coordinators and staff at newyork presbyterian weill cornell ucla and a group of seven people a partnership connecting both coasts is that a chain of people have better lives and the chain goes on
1313520 if we can get this exchange program going its going to be the answer to lots of peoples situations
1313521 this is going to help so many people down the line
1313522 pam couldnt sit on the transplant wait list for several years something needed to be done im glad i could do my part to help
1313523 everyone would benefit if more donated today its me tomorrow its someone else
1313524 it was like a closed door that is now being opened again
1313525 randy and i talked about it and we said ok hes willing to give to somebody else and i wont have to take as many medications after the surgery
1313526 seems like the people dont know what to say to me
1313527 maybe its just that they dont know what to say to a genius
1313528 weve never so much as gotten a single measurement of anything outside
1313529 p atents are often justified by the allegedly high cost of developing drugs
1313530 distort the market skewing it toward where the money is
1313531 most of the residents of are now in their 90s and we would urge the mbf to respect their wishes and allow them to live out the rest of their lives in ivor newton house
1313532 i have lived in ivor newton house since 2004 and there is no way i want to move
1313533 my last at bat it kind of pulled back a little bit
1313534 you feel that click and you get a little concerned about it
1313535 ive just been relying on my fastball and my curveball pretty much and using my other two pitches every once in a while
1313536 in the first inning he got a good fastball up and away and he pounded it to right its not easy to play on the road thats pretty good
1313537 were close friends off the field ill talk to him tonight
1313538 he was able to foul off some pretty good pitches and i got him
1313539 the last one was up and off the plate a little and i swung through it
1313540 he started throwing his breaking ball and he had enough on his fastball he made some pretty good pitches
1313541 i kind of sat back on it and pena was aggressive it fell in that little spot where we both wanted to make that last out and we should have talked more but soria came up big at the end
1313542 they were swinging at a lot of pitches up in the zone and luckily thats kind of where my release point was today and i got away with it
1313543 the residents are so angry and have said they will put poison around the plantation areas to kill the elephants unless officials take quick action
1313544 im afraid that another attack on their plantations will push villagers to launch their plan
1313545 people here eagerly planted palmoil as it brings more profits but its all been easily destroyed by elephants
1313546 its a division rival obviously and its a national tv game and given what brett meant to packers fans and the number of fans around the country we wanted to make sure everyone would see it that was important
1313547 more troops are coming and we will launch a major operation and we will go after the militants in their strongholds
1313548 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1313549 he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1313550 you know how tyra likes to do that stuff and shell get a lot of press off it

1313552 kirsten coach indian team has been granted leave to go to south africa to be with his mother as she is critically ill
1313553 the way i play is by gut instinct i like to do things spontaneously i want the team to play similarly to the way i play my game although you have to be accountable for the things you do and be responsible for the decisions you make
1313554 i dont think i would be sitting here if i wasnt 100 per cent confident that everything is going to be perfectly fine peter likes to challenge players but the crux of the meeting was to determine and decipher where peter and myself can take this england team
1313555 kevin will take it his own way and he has his own ideas on captaincy were looking for a fresh approach and he will take us forward in an exciting manner we did discuss whether it would affect his batting but it was a very short discussion we will wait and see but i dont foresee any difficulties with that
1313556 blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
1313557 blessed are you when men cast insults at you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you falsely on account of me
1313558 rejoice and be glad for your reward in heaven is great for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you
1313559 let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works and glorify your father who is in heaven
1313560 submit yourselves for the lords sake to every human institution whether to a king as the one in authority 14 or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right 15 for such is the will of god that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men
1313561 conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders making the most of the opportunity 6 let your speech always be with grace seasoned as it were with salt so that you may know how you should respond to each person
1313562 so this is what christians are like inconsiderate disrespectful silly and shallow in short off the deep end
1313563 all kinds of evil against her falsely on account of jesus
1313564 diseqc 1 0 1 1 amp 1 2 usals control technology
1313565 oh my god how could you do that to me ive never had a guy wanna eat me before
1313566 im allowed to discriminate and think less of you because its what i believe and you cannot discriminate against me or think less of me because of it as discrimination is wrong
1313567 you do know this rubbish is all made up and isnt even the teensiest bit true
1313568 the quake had potential for tsunami but it did not occur and we did not issue the warning
1313569 the ron paul crowd is no different they think their prophet isnt really a crooked self serving politician even though all of the rest are crooked and self serving
1313570 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same day as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than sufficient to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1313571 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about world wide web services and learn we will the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to prepare it a service we are all proud of by the end of that year

1313601 i apologize i never read an audit and never asked for one
1313602 were just normal people who like to play a game

1313616 local communities a say in the placement of criminally insane individuals
1313617 were talking about sex offenders arsonists attempted murder assaulting a police officer and other violent crimes these clients present the most risk the highest danger to the community

1313635 we are satisfied that google is putting in place adequate safeguards to avoid any risk to the privacy or safety of individuals including the blurring of vehicle registration marks and the faces of anyone included in streetview images
1313636 although it is possible that in certain limited circumstances an image may allow the identification of an individual it is clear that google is keen to capture images of streets and not individuals
1313637 images are not real time and there is a delay between taking an image and its publication so that it could not be used to make decisions about an individuals current whereabouts

1313655 i think rob portman would be very helpful in ohio
1313656 one of the keys for a john mccain victory will be to win ohio and big numbers in southwest ohio will help mccain do that
1313657 it would be hard to separate himself from bush when one of the architects of the bush economic policy is on the ticket
1313658 i think i can be supportive just being a surrogate
1313659 my passion right now is how do we make ohio a better state to create more jobs and opportunities

1313664 i suggest the introduction of transmission rate caps which would allow users to purchase access to the internet at a given minimum data rate and be free to transfer data at least up to that rate in any way they wish
1313665 clicking on a link can take you to an unexpected streaming site or a major file transfer

1313674 for decades the medial temporal lobe structures have been linked to both memory and spatial cognition
1313675 so we set out to test how these two abilities related to one another and to the temporal lobe area of the brain
1313676 we concluded that the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are not essential for path integration since we showed that the tests could be successfully accomplished despite damage to these brain regions
1313677 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends
1313678 but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public dina is still working on the date of the party but its looking like towards the end of the year
1313679 police chiefs shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
1313680 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
1313681 how do we make sure we do the right thing for our companies and clients when the system process persons et al wont give you the control over things you truly need to have in order to make sure the goals are met
1313682 as a result of these new relationships we believe that the carbon trust can deliver even greater value to the businesses we support and ensure the best chance of rapid take up of viable low carbon technologies which will be vital to accelerate the move towards a low carbon economy
1313683 i initially just wanted to be a student for another year
1313684 but during that year i got a real taste for the restaurant business
1313685 its still the case but it was even more so 30 years ago that to get a career in the restaurant business you needed to have done your time washing dishes and serving customers for those of us that came from a traditional university education it gave us the opportunity to get experience under our belts
1313686 i hated it the management hierarchy it was so overruled and it didnt really deliver what the customers wanted
1313687 she wanted it to be something that could grow more of a brand she had a really clear idea of what she wanted but just didnt have the skills in her team to develop it get funding and find the right sites etc so we came together as a partnership
1313688 i think it would have been easier for us to raise 200m for an online food venture at that time than the 2m we needed for a bricks and mortar business pricilla and i must have done a hundred presentations but the venture capitalists just werent interested
1313689 pricilla had imagined it as a kind of italian bar where you might pop in for an espresso and slice of pizza but she hadnt really viewed it as a restaurant over christmas that year i rewrote the menu put the prices up added a breakfast menu and extended the opening hours so we could trade from 8am to 11pm
1313690 we had people at breakfast lunch and dinner people came in for take away coffees and picnics wed gone from a fatally flawed business model to suddenly having the most exciting restaurant model any of us had ever seen
1313691 that was great for us because they invested all the money it was very close to our first site and being in the store we had a captive audience
1313692 it transformed the business from being one that was spending capital to one that was generating cash
1313693 we had a few choices we could have sold the business to another restaurateur or a private equity firm but i felt the management team still had more to do none of us wanted to go off and do something else so we floated on aim i felt that at least that way we were in control of our own destiny
1313694 your chance of being one of those people that works their guts out and then runs out of steam is very high which is why youve got to be really determined
1313695 por lo menos 35 000 votos para obtener un diputado y esto est muy muy lejos de sus expectativas electorales

1313714 y que me dice de las razones de ecuador les descubren un campamento guerrillero qui n sabe cuantos mas habr y su respuesta posterior es jugando con nuestro dolor que estaban en negociaciones para liberar a los secuestrados eso si lo tenemos que creer
1313715 innumerables veces que los terroristas atacaron y asesinaron colombianos desde el lado ecuatoriano y todas esas veces se le comunic al gobierno ecuatoriano nunca quisieron conformar una unidad binacional fronteriza para hacerle frente a esa amenaza cosa que si esta establecida en paises como per y brasil
1313716 ecuador ya ha reconocido que si hicieron contactos con los terroristas sin autorizacion del gobierno colombiano
1313717 ecuador sabia que campamentos como esos existen la interpol le hab a comunicado que reyes estaba en sucumbios desde hac a ya un tiempo
1313718 hay resoluciones de la onu que permiten realizar operaciones de este tipo
1313719 porque no lees primero los art culos en donde los presidentes de ecuador y venezuela se sienten tristes por la muerte del guerrillero ra l reyes
1313720 la intervenci n o violaci n de la soberan a de colombia a ecuador esta totalmente justificada con las pruebas que salieron a la luz sobre los nexos de ecuador y venezuela con ese grupo terrorista

1313726 we believe that achieving a speed 158 7mph sets a record for a production bike on home brewed fuel biofuel is a buzzword at the moment with the government setting a target for all petrol and diesel to contain a minimum 5 biofuel by 2010 although they are still questionable from an environmental point of view biofuels are here to stay and this experiment was all about exploring how much power we could extract from them as well as having some fun
1313727 at the moment all triumph motorcycles are designed for optimum performance with non ethanol fuel but are compatible with e10 10 ethanol were currently investigating making all models compatible with e25 fuel so while this is a fun experiment it does have a serious side and were looking forward to reviewing the results

1313729 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza
1313730 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts
1313731 we have nothing to do with the obama campaign we just like obama and believe he will be the best for the palestinians and for the world
1313732 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama
1313733 maybe we sold the shirts for a lot more i cant remember now
1313734 we dont want to cause any damage to obamas campaign

1313739 the new bike looks great and is already a lot better to ride than last years gsv r it feels quicker and i am able to get on the power better out of the corners the handling is even better than it was so that is a huge plus because it was very good already suzuki has worked really hard on this bike and listened to what we wanted and tried to come up with a solution for everything we gave them it is not quite the finished article yet but i am sure that when the season starts it will be pretty close to it
1313740 i have been with suzuki a short while but for me they are very switched on and are trying their hardest to make the bike the best it can be for the new season
1313741 i still feel like i have a new toy suzuki is certainly listening to what we want we asked for changes after each test and the next time we have ridden the bike they have been made so that is all good the bike also looks great with the new design i love the colour and look forward racing in it

1313746 theyre the trends that are coming through for next summer

1313748 im thinking why the hell didnt i do this earlier
1313749 in this olympic games theres so much depth that to qualify through the heats you have to go so fast and that perhaps could take the edge off the final and make it difficult to get into the low 14 30s
1313750 but at the same time this is the olympic games so anything goes and anything can happen
1313751 maybe that record could go maybe not its a matter of who can step up in the context of an olympic games when the pressure is really on
1313752 sydney 2000 was tough athens was extremely tough and this will probably be harder again it doesnt get any easier thats for sure
1313753 i probably feel more relaxed going into this olympic games and am enjoying it a little bit more but ill be going to the well yet again and digging as deep as possible ill certainly give it everything
1313754 i got out of that stale rut i felt like i was in back on the gold coast and training in the same place for 21 years
1313755 ive been able to improve and steadily step up in my performance over the time and competed very well with the 800 short course world record a couple of weeks ago
1313756 that gives me confidence i feel like im swimming well i feel like ive prepared well ive been consistent in my preparation
1313757 my focus in this preparation has been on the 1500 but i guess in some respects the 400 almost feels like a bonus event for me
1313758 i would love to better my personal best time and thats probably my goal in that event at this stage but by how much im not sure
1313759 there were no snipers in tskhinvali neither on august 4 or on earlier days
1313760 we had negotiations with russia and we may resume the peace process in tskhinvali region soon but not in the frames of the so called jcc joint control commission but in another format
1313761 we want to protect the peace through the process of the negotiations but if there are no more options left we will conduct the actions necessary to finally solve this problem

1313774 paul has done a track about how he feels about heather and what was going on with the paparazzi because no one has heard his side of it at all so this will be the first time anyone hears a song relating to that subject
1313775 its very emotional and a very powerful song not like anything that people are used to paul mccartney doing
1313776 i was awakened by magic i was alone in this world take me away from here
1313777 we could climb every mountain swim through every sea when all the world is asleep we could set ourselves free
1313778 what the song shows is that rather than feeling embittered towards heather paul just feels sorry for her
1313779 he feels sorry that she was never able to tell him the full truth about her past life he feels that their romance happened so fast and so publicly that a lot never really got said
1313780 paul knows heather is a complex person and deeply misunderstood but that she has hardly helped herself by being less than transparent about her life
1313781 i come here every summer to take care of my cows but it is harder every year my children try to persuade me not to come here anymore but i love this place and dont want to leave
1313782 i am an old woman and if there wont be a road much longer i might not be able to come at some point
1313783 there havent been many cases of border violations in last three years
1313784 there were individual cases of people lost but nothing big
1313785 there was a lot of communication and war between the tushs and the leks in the old times leks came to steal the cattle the tushs went over to avenge but there is none of that after the border came under control
1313786 i was here two years ago with many friends and was amazed by these mountains so i decided to do it again
1313787 im very happy that were so close to the start of racing
1313788 the fiat yamaha initiative has been a success for fiat from the start
1313789 the main area we need to work on is the hard braking areas where we still have some vibration
1313790 unfortunately i lost the front and crashed at turn 13 but it wasnt a big fall and i wasnt hurt at all
1313791 i went back to the pits and went out on my other bike forgot about the problem and started improving straight away
1313792 luckily jorge wasnt hurt so despite his crash it was a good days work for us we continued with the base set up we had in jerez where he was quite fast and it seems to work okay the main area we need to work on is the hard braking areas where we still have some vibration so we need to concentrate on improving the bike for those parts of the track we tried a new specification engine and some new electronics and jorge felt very comfortable with these tomorrow we will continue with general set up work and also start testing new tyres with michelin we have a lot to do but so far things are going quite well
1313793 i am really pleased to have secured the number seven on my bike for 2008 barry was a huge influence on my career and i always had it in my mind to one day race a suzuki with the number that he made famous on it i just hope that i now have the same success that he enjoyed
1313794 it feels good to be back on the bike after the winter break and me and all my team are feeling very motivated about the task ahead
1313795 i still have some pain in my hand but i had it checked out again last week and the fracture is okay so i know its not a problem to ride
1313796 it was unfortunate that valentino crashed as well as quite a few other riders but he is fine the bike was okay after some work and it didnt interrupt things too much the surface was quite poor and this caused problems for everyone but anyway we were able to get quite a lot of work done and overall its been a good first day despite valentinos problem of course were working a lot with bridgestone continuing from the work we did in jerez and so far we seem to be going well tomorrow we might try a long run and check the situation with the tyres over many laps so this will be interesting
1313797 the main area we need to work on is the hard braking areas where we still have some vibration
1313798 i couldnt expect a better result for my come back in bercy and im so happy to win this race
1313799 lets see there have been something like 84 official releases who out there has
1313800 far as im concerned you turned someone i knew into a gorilla just like that
1313801 there is a grip on the right side of your handlebar and all you have to do is twist it open until you break
1313802 it is by far my best race i did not steal it and was in with the leaders the whole way so that was good the spinnaker reach in the bay of biscay was a bit long it
1313803 for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as were all our fathers
1313804 the young law professor stood apart in too many ways to count
1313805 with the exception of preventing war this is the greatest challenge our country will face during our lifetime
1313806 one of the good things that came out of the oil shock of the 70s was the dramatic push for energy conservation
1313807 from cars and homes to factories and offices we know how to cost effectively deliver vast quantities of energy savings today
1313808 would be sufficient to cut projected global demand by at least half
1313809 this select group of players are putting aside individual recognition and instead placing their trust in the us colors and each other
1313810 the story weve created illustrates their commitment to this team to winning and representing their country in beijing
1313811 i wasnt pushing so hard at the time of the crash i lost the front going into turn 11 it was quite a big crash the bike caught fire and i hurt my right hand today it was good to be riding again after the winter break we were working on general set up getting a good feel for the bike before starting some comparison tests
1313812 its good to be back coming in here yesterday it was pretty cool because i had a line of mechanics and two brand new hrc factory gp bikes waiting on me every nut and bolt was brand new and to me thats pretty cool today didnt go the best at the start the chassis feels different to the prototype i tested last november it took me a while to get a good feel from the front though towards the end of the day we made some progress doing some geometry stuff and a little bit of suspension i didnt test any tyres today we just used reference tyres because i wasnt going fast enough first we had to get the bike working better the shoulders better though i still need to get some more strength in it so thats day one in the books tomorrow well see if we can try the pneumatic engine and test some tyres weve got plenty of work to do and its a long way to go to qatar
1313813 but theyve really come up with the goods the rear end has been one of its main talking points you either love it or you hate it i believe that our new gp sports have made it much easier to love
1313814 especially the three carbon fibre elements unlike other systems our is a totally integrated solution thats been designed specifically for the b king and we believe itll be very popular with owners
1313815 most people probably think that hyosung only started making bikes a few years ago this model highlights the fact that hyosung has 30 years of motorcycle design and manufacturing experience in korea and its an increasingly serious make new bikes next year demonstrate the companys ambitions
1313816 im very proud to be here in this garage and its been quite an emotional day for me
1313817 im very happy to have the chance to try my new bike and i enjoyed myself a lot today
1313818 today has been a sort of team launch because we had new staff members joining the team and above all our new rider jorge lorenzo i think that today we did a good job and it felt like there was a good atmosphere in our garage we only had three hours of testing but jorge completed 56 laps more than any other rider today each run was more or less ten laps and this means that he was able to keep a high level of concentration his attitude towards the development of the bike was very good jorge learnt a lot today and i am sure he will learn even more tomorrow
1313819 the reason that these new gp sport silencer look so good on the new hayabusa is that they were designed specifically for the bike
1313820 its something that our sophisticated cad systems and hydroforming manufacturing process allow us to do and well be introducing more gp sport products on important 2008 models in the coming weeks the new hayabusa maintains the extraordinary performance of its predecessor
1313821 and these new gp sport end cans improve considerably the overall looks of this bike while taking nothing away from that truly astonishing performance
1313822 the hayabusas engine is used of course in suzukis other big 2007 launch the b king were planning to unveil soon a remarkable solution for that bikes much talked about exhaust
1313823 and it represents remarkable value the new delta sport silencer finishes it off beautifully and turns it into a proper sports bike

1313829 a lot of people dont understand what a bridge is but for me its the most important part of a song next to the chorus if you go straight from verse to chorus it throws your timing out because then either the verse has to be too long and becomes boring or the chorus comes in too early to me the ideally paced song is one which has a chorus type intro for about eight bars which at 120bpm lasts for about 16 seconds then an eight bar verse and an eight bar bridge which means youre up to about a minute for your first chorus if the chorus happens any later than that the radio stations will take if off because theyre fed up but if youve got a good bridge leading up to something they feel drawn to it

1313852 our recommendations recognize the large number of scientific studies that demonstrate greater accuracy in identifying women at risk of having or developing cervical cancer when a pap is combined with the hpv test rather than relying on a pap smear alone
1313853 by using both tests for women 30 and over when cervical cancer is most common we hope to greatly reduce the number of women suffering and dying from this disease
1313854 unlike other cancers cervical cancer is virtually 100 percent preventable if women and their healthcare providers have access to the hpv test and other new advances in preventive care

1313893 originally when i was given the opportunity i thought it would be kind of a neat way to see poland but then i started doing research on the black madonna and the siege and i thought its part of a much bigger thing
1313894 its pretty neat to be taking part in this and help improve relations with poland and other countries that are here

1313901 just as were speaking a pickup truck is coming across our scale with some farm equipment and some old barbed wire fence
1313902 they get money here and they supplement their income and pay for their food and their fuel and their rent and everything else
1313903 a year or two ago im sure i would have probably just went out to dinner or maybe even went to the movies or something to that effect rather than filling up my tank
1313904 it used to all be for my kids now i use some to pay for gas

1313928 what motivates me the most is the chance to make history in brazilian football and win this first gold medal
1313929 we all know that if we win this medal we will make history its an unprecedented title
1313930 its a very important competition just as important to us the world cup and other big tournaments
1313931 very few players have an opportunity to participate in two olympics and im glad im having this chance to win what we let slip away in the past
1313932 every time a professional player changes teams and plays in an important competition its a new start
1313933 im very happy with these opportunities and im motivated to do my best
1313934 its a special moment in my career and i hope ill be able to do my best here
1313935 we need a good start to put us on the right track for the rest of the olympics
1313936 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1313937 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1313938 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved
1313939 is clearly under our sovereignty and we have to demand it back
1313940 our position is to try to talk to them thai troops and get them to withdraw to where they came from
1313941 over the weekend about 40 to 50 of them came and they were armed so the thai troops did not allow them in
1313942 im sure this will be the most spread of medals that weve ever seen at an olympic games
1313943 traditionally a lot of time at world championship level its been between australia and america but i dont think thats going to be the case this time were going to see a lot of other counties step up
1313944 weve got to remember that there are so many other countries theres japan were here in china they have a strong contingent and certainly europe that are going to eat into that medal tally
1313945 i think we had a really really strong team this year
1313946 were focusing on ourselves and what we need to do as a team and make sure that individually we get the performances
1313947 what any other team may be doing and what treatment they get is not a worry nor a focus for us
1313948 i dont think my place in the final is cemented at all theres a lot of hard work getting through the heats
1313949 im going to miss going but this is what i always wanted

1313952 this is the biggest achievement by a new zealander in the history of volleyball and by any new zealand born coach for some time
1313953 the magic probably had one of their worst games of the championship in terms of turnover and error rate
1313954 its australia versus new zealand and is a different environment
1313955 while the anz champs is a very elite environment there is still another step to go to international
1313956 if we could get a bit more efficiency that could make it easier
1313957 i just think in the final playing some of the players out of their position worked in the swifts favour
1313958 once ruth gets her squad together i do think some of those gaps can be filled
1313959 as i say we are learning under the elvs i have been out coached before and i will get out coached again
1313960 every dog has its day and i am working hard to fix up my bits and pieces
1313961 we did lose the tactical battle and played too much behind our gain line
1313962 while we made a lot of line breaks and we want to keep those we want to avoid the ones where we turned the ball over
1313963 that is all about decision making and picking when the right times are to go and when the time is to turn the pressure back on them
1313964 we dont give a hell of a lot of messages i think our job is for us to be redundant as possible during game time
1313965 we are trying to teach them to take responsibility and give feedback and run the game
1313966 its as if you are the principal of a small high school

1314001 i am pleased and honoured to be involved in the development of this special model we all understand how important enduro is in the uk and with this model we are able to offer a very competent bike that mirrors what im racing this season
1314002 the carbon disc brakes which at first do not seem to brake but then suddenly brake strongly and so the rear wheel tends to lift you have to be careful when changing gear since the 1st gear is by moving the pedal upwards and the rest down it is like this because it is much more comfortable on left handed curves like the long curve coming into the home straight this lets you change gear in the middle of the curve without having to put your foot under the pedal when leaning over when braking you will notice that your arms will bend and it seems that you are going to go off the front so keep your arms straight and squeeze strongly as for the rest enjoy the power and speed on this bike they are incredible the two repsol riders had an experience on the repsol honda rc212v that they have defined as unique both did 3 laps of the circuit in valencia admitting that it had been enough as it is very demanding physically to ride this machine toni bou world indoor and outdoor trial champion 2007 commented
1314003 this year the repsol honda team and michelin have been defeated
1314004 i was really looking forward to going sailing for the first time but i never thought it would be like this competitive tactical technical and a sport where team work is essential i am still shaking from the adrenalin
1314005 i am delighted to have secured a rider of james calibre and am looking forward to working with him
1314006 procuring james is a major coup for tech 3 yamaha and for the motogp championship in extending our reach into northern europe it is an exciting time for us all and i am certain that he will be an integral part of the teams future
1314007 i would like to thank the team for all of their help and support
1314008 this year the repsol honda team and michelin have been defeated
1314009 we at michelin are honoured and proud to continue this very successful partnership with repsol honda with whom we have won eight world championships since 1995 and we are committed to achieving victory in 2008 through very close intense and technological collaboration
1314010 im really happy to be joining up with michelin again next year
1314011 im confident they can supply us with race winning tyres next year

1314013 ama team usa is thrilled that monster has taken on the role as team sponsor
1314014 the financial support that monster energy is providing to the team will make a significant contribution to this years effort
1314015 hey why not suggest that the governator amp his school board take this algebra test in public and the results for public consumption
1314016 with the r1 i was really surprised how much power there is on the standard bike
1314017 theres plenty enough there to get the front wheel up in first second and third without trying
1314018 i was in valencia to meet some yamaha competition winners when the chance came up to do some demonstration laps at the circuit so naturally i grabbed the chance i took the r1 out first and was surprised by the strength of the engine its quite something for a stock road bike ive not ridden the standard version before but it felt very comfortable with quite a neutral position this will make it quite roomy even for the larger rider the handlebars are higher than on my race bike which im sure will make it better for longer distance riding
1314019 i cant believe how much it has changed it is smaller than the r1 but just as much fun the power delivery is softer than on the r1 but it revs really high much higher than the r1 which makes for good amounts of fun on the track or the road
1314020 to be honest the chassis on the r6 feels pretty close to the chassis on my race bike and it handles well overall its an impressive little package
1314021 found a transaction past the completion deadline on bus 0xfa timing out
1314022 ive enjoyed the two day test working with rizla suzuki
1314023 we got through a lot of work and i hope my thoughts will help the team to be competitive during the second half of the bsb season
1314024 coming back to cadwell park after a long break has been exciting the circuit has improved since i last visited ive relished working with rizla suzuki the atmosphere is fantastic and positive the team and staff deserve good results they are working hard enough for them and i hope they come soon
1314025 it has been the perfect weather for a test and rizla suzuki leaves cadwell park with more information and direction on how to extract the maximum performance from its race bikes
1314026 neil got through a heavy test programme by anyones standards and has done countless laps trying new settings parts and tyres he certainly found a direction in tyre choice that we will be pursuing for the rest of the season
1314027 well take all of neils opinions back to our crescent performance centre hq and start analysing what we can use to help both our riders to be more competitive at knockhill in just over a weeks time thank you to neil for joining us and putting in such hard graft over the last two days
1314028 shortly after the start michel suddenly fell off his bike and i stopped to see what happened he had broken his right arm and i stayed with him until the first aid people arrived i didnt care about the race because we are friends first
1314029 the test last week went pretty well and i felt comfortable on the ninja zx rr straight away
1314030 itll definitely take a bit of getting used to but im really grateful for the support of kawasaki who flew me all the way to japan so id already be a little bit familiar with the bike before the race its a lot smaller than the bikes i normally ride and revs a lot higher but it handles really well and i feel i made the transition quite smoothly its a dream come true to race a motogp bike at laguna seca and its been years since i raced against nicky im not putting any pressure on myself id just like it to be a positive experience and if i can score some points that would be awesome with quite a few americans on the grid the crowd will certainly have something to cheer about plus my family and friends are going to come along so it should all be pretty cool
1314031 originally we had no intention of running any wild card riders this year but we were able to look again at the possibility after the catalunya race and it quickly became apparent that there was an opportunity for us to run a third bike at laguna seca america is a very important market for kawasaki so thats why weve made the decision to be the first manufacturer to run an american wild card rider in the u s grand prix since its return to the calendar in 2005 we chose roger lee because hes a long serving member of the kawasaki family representing kawasaki in the domestic championships in the united states we dont have any particular expectations of him in the race as his time on the bike so far has been limited but we know that he will be out to secure the best result possible for himself and i hope that he will enjoy the chance to ride kawasakis ninja zx rr in front of his home crowd who knows maybe this will be the start of us using wildcard riders more in the future or possibly running a third bike full time in the championship next year
1314032 after few laps the track was becoming drier and it turned out wed chosen a rear tyre that was too soft for those conditions and i just couldnt maintain the pace i tried to stay with de puniet and i had battle with barros in the last few laps but i had very little traction at the rear and unfortunately i couldnt hold him off this was definitely a disappointing race for us although we had promising performance in practice and qualifying which is positive its a pity because with casey winning again the gap in the championship has opened up quite a lot well just have to fight back quickly at the next race
1314033 it felt like i could go quicker though when stoner came through i was having quite a hard time seeing because of the spray still i felt like i could go towards the front and i was enjoying the race then i just got in a little bit hot at the top of the hill and lost the front id been passed there earlier once or twice and just didnt want to go back any further i felt really good everywhere except on the brakes where i was quite weak some of the guys were really strong on the brakes although i felt like i had better exit grip and better traction it sucks to crash out of the race but it wasnt as if i crashed while going backwards and struggling at least i was up front and so im going to take the positives from this weekend being fastest in the dry on saturday morning was a big boost for me and i definitely feel that ive been the most competitive ive been all year
1314034 we are proud to be strengthening our sponsorship programme in this way
1314035 were really excited to be involved with the world championship we already have a relationship with james and with him enjoying such huge success in this years series it seems the perfect time for us to offer our support to him as he looks set to become superbike world champion for the second time this complements our current sponsorship of the domestic championship perfectly
1314036 its great news to hear that the series is attracting further support from a leading uk brand
1314037 weve made a good start to the weekend and my bike is already going very well
1314038 this morning was okay but then this afternoon especially we made a lot of steps forward with the tyres and with the setting
1314039 my position doesnt really show it but actually were not in bad shape today considering where we were this time a week ago in italy
1314040 were missing a bit of traction but weve got some ideas to work on overnight and tomorrow which will hopefully help us in this department
1314041 yamaha gave me a fantastic chance to show my potential on the r6 its thanks to this ride that i feel ive got my career back on track to leave yamaha now is sad but its such a great chance for me to follow my dream to go to motogp
1314042 yamaha didnt want to block this chance for me im grateful they believed in me and gave me the chance to prove myself i want to add that im really sorry to the supersport team guys and id like to thank them for all their hard work and support the crew have been great and the bike was fast from the first minute i sat on it ive not been used to such a professional team and they really made me feel at home
1314043 the financial compensation ive got to pay is severe but ive got the chance to show what i can do on a motogp bike and i hope its worth it it was important for me to be released from the team by mutual agreement im still young and yamaha is a good company and who knows maybe at some point in my career we can work together again

1314094 its a long cherished dream to work with salman khan said ashutosh gowarikar on the sidelines of the world kids international film festival held in the capital recently but the perfectionist director has nothing concrete to offer the peter pan actor right away as soon as i find a script which suits his image i will approach him

1314100 the mysterious assassination of a top syrian army officer and
1314101 suleiman would have been involved in that process and it was known that shawkat hated suleiman
1314102 the major issue now facing syria is its relationship with iran and hizbullah and how it can reconcile that with talking to israel the assassination means there is a power struggle going on in syria and it most probably concerns iran people like this dont just die unless something is going on

1314106 an attempt is being made to communalise the amarnath issue the police have also dealt very cruely with the situation at the all party meeting on wednesday we will press for a solution acceptable to all regions
1314107 the situation should be handled in such a way that life and property of the people are fully protected communal harmony must be maintained at all costs and it must be ensured that minorities do not feel insecure
1314108 these threats reflect the confusion in the israeli occupation forces in dealing with hamas and the gaza strip and between escalating the aggression and swinging between the escalation of aggression and de escalation
1314109 i am very pleased as i really wanted to win a centenary tt
1314110 the standard of competition is very high and ive been working very hard to get in shape over the winter as the tt really is the highlight of my year i felt very strong and wanted to keep all the younger riders at bay so i pushed as hard as i could but there were a lot of damp patches on the first lap so i had to take some precaution the pit stops were amazing the team worked superbly and it helped me even further obviously there is a lot of pressure as we build up to the races but i feel so relieved and its great to do it in front of such a big crowd the machinery worked well so a big thanks to both the team and to honda it wasnt all plain sailing i had a few big moments but once i saw i had a 30 second lead i was able to steady up on the last two laps and just wanted to bring the bike home safely hopefully we can repeat this in the other races

1314128 the external environment has deteriorated and the consequences of this for northern rock are increased credit losses

1314130 when i was younger i used to watch the track and field a lot but for me seeing agassi win gold was awesome
1314131 its an honour and a privilege to get this opportunity and hopefully i can replicate what he did when he won his gold medal
1314132 im feeling good all the worlds top players are going to be there but on my current form theres no reason why i cant challenge for a medal

1314141 we have ordered a magisterial probe into the police firing in samba on protestors in which two persons were killed on monday
1314142 the firing on protestors was resorted to by the police team led by the ssp

1314154 as many are aware the raleigh area has experienced a recent spike in homicides and robberies many of which are gang related
1314155 other gang related crimes have also drawn recent attention while local law enforcement bears the burden of investigating and prosecuting the majority of such crimes particularly those involving juveniles federal law enforcement is actively involved in this effort
1314156 we are working very diligently to focus all available federal resources on the problem of violent crime in the eastern district partnering with our state and local counterparts we are committed to safe communities in this federal district
1314157 the closest thing weve had to harry in recent times its phenomenally exciting and its only going to grow
1314158 what started out as a cult interest fan base has spread
1314159 its one of those things that has a massive crossover appeal its a real guilty pleasure for grown ups
1314160 we knew this was going to be huge but it looks as if its going to be absolutely huge we havent seen this level of excitement about any childrens book bar potter in many years weve had thousands of pre orders and its exceeded even our expectations

1314162 if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1314163 yeah we almost started to believe that we had to rebuild the bike
1314164 apparently the bike is not so bad after all ryuichis double win has proven that and also carlos on his first time around here at brands hatch quite a peculiar track was on the pace
1314165 its perfect to see kiyonari do so well we all know what kind of a racer he is but he also has to learn a lot of the tracks this year which has been a bit difficult for him now we have come to a track he really knows well and we have seen the result
1314166 on the positive side you can say hes really fast at tracks he knows the downside is that he usually takes quite a lot of time to learn new tracks he needs to really feel confident about where the track is going and what he has to do before he goes fast
1314167 its usually by sunday that he understands all of that but here on friday morning on the third lap he did he was already into the 1min 26secs which proved to be race pace
1314168 its such a big help if you can immediately do race times then you can start to set the bike up and make selection for the tyres

1314179 we wish them luck but i think it may be a little bit optimistic
1314180 in some ways the more we look at the problem the harder it seems to get
1314181 how are you going to set up the distribution sites making sure you even have something to hand out finding out when the attack actually occurred so you can start that process having your political leaders have enough confidence in the decision to go ahead and order a massively disruptive response like that
1314182 the problem is the federal government gets an a plus but most cities get ds or fs because they dont have a system to rapidly dispense it to break down those large quantities and get it out in a rapid manner to the citizens
1314183 in particular i think we miscalculated on how fragile and starved of resources the public health system truly is
1314184 as we go forward its going to get easier and easier to engineer organisms into new kinds of biological weapons
1314185 there are 26 presidentially appointed senate confirmed people working in biodefense in the federal government
1314186 not one has it as a full time job and no one is in charge
1314187 having studied in detail the programmes of real madrid and the dutch eleven i realised that given the physical effort required to perform at my maximum i was going to have to make a choice

1314189 of course i find it a pity that i wont be able to call on his quality and international experience in putting teams together in the future

1314269 do you remember those days when id drag myself into your classroom five minutes late
1314270 youd chew me out and id give you every reason for me being late some of those days i even had to stoop to using the truth
1314271 yes i could always count on your coming in five to ten minutes late your excuses were always colorful and entertaining though not always truthful
1314272 you chewed me out royally one day and told me that the world will not take my excuses ill either make it or fail but there are no excuses allowed you might have thought it went in one ear and out the other but i listened
1314273 during basic training my di constantly told me no excuses when i failed to do something i had to get up and try again until i succeeded no excuses were acceptable
1314274 i learned that i will succeed or i will fail but no one is willing to listen to or accept my excuses
1314275 last month in iraq i was hit by sniper fire i took a round in my vest and it knocked the wind out of me and bruised me but im alive we could tell where the sniper fire was coming from and we did exactly what wed been trained to do working as a team each person trusting the other one to do his job we attacked and killed the sniper at that point i remembered you telling me no excuses and my di echoing no excuses over and over again if each one of us hadnt done what we were supposed to do it could have cost the life of another member of our team

1314278 he said that god doesnt take excuses either he just extends mercy

1314296 look dad he just came through the wall into a room filled with bad guys one of them pulls his gun and shoots at him what happens
1314297 the bad guy fired his gun at supermans chest the bullets bounce off then when his bullets are gone he throws the gun at superman did you notice what he did
1314298 it would hurt to get hit by the gun sorry to spoil the program for you dad but i think youre old enough to handle the truth
1314299 run to him and let him embrace you hes been waiting for you for years
1314300 im cooking garbage these people have no idea what theyre doing

1314305 very low cost of doing business and very high margins thats kind of the sweet spot for any business
1314306 we were clearly interested in extending our business model to this device and were excited about the opportunities for further interactivity
1314307 i think were reaching customers that we would never have had access to

1314318 before you are a leader success is all about growing yourself when you become a leader success is all about growing others
1314319 if a rhinoceros were to enter this restaurant now there is no denying he would have great power here but i should be the first to rise and assure him that he had no authority whatever
1314320 the task of the leader is to get his people from where they are to where they have not been

1314322 dont do anything its not her fault im an idiot
1314323 wir haben losgelegt wie die feuerwehr und in der ersten halbzeit am oberen limit gespielt
1314324 so etwas darf uns nat rlich berhaupt nicht passieren trotzdem haben wir verdient gewonnen und freuen uns ber die punkte
1314325 10 bis 15 schlechten minuten in der zweiten h lfte
1314326 heute w re ein ergebnis m glich gewesen bei dem jeder sagt boah
1314327 daf r dass es unsere erste saisonpartie war und wir einige neue spieler in unseren reihen haben war das sensationell gut allerdings war auch nicht alles gold was gl nzte
1314328 bis zum 27 14 war das wirklich sch ner handball von uns dann sind wir v llig au er tritt geraten wenn du so ein spiel verlierst bei t du dir bis zum st nimmerleinstag in den hintern
1314329 wenn wir uns das h tten nehmen lassen w ren wir sch ne pfeifen gewesen
1314330 ein sieg mit zehn toren differenz ist ein klasse ausrufezeichen
1314331 melsungen pr sentiert sich st rker als in der letzten saison ich denke dass sie in diesem jahr nichts mit dem abstieg zu tun haben werden und sehe sie eher auf einem einstelligen tabellenplatz das wird ein richtig schweres spiel f r uns
1314332 auf die leistung der ersten halbzeit in kiel k nnen wir aufbauen ich bin zuversichtlich dass wir dem hsv das leben schwer machen werden
1314333 man wei nicht genau wo man steht muss erst wieder in den rhythmus kommen
1314334 should texas execute mr medellin before congress has a reasonable opportunity to convert the icj judgment into a justifiable federal right the state of texas will forever deprive mr medellin of his constitutionally protected right not to be deprived of his life without a due process of law
1314335 to ensure that its judgment has its intended effect of guiding the political branches to a constitutionally permissible method of complying with the nations treaty obligations
1314336 executing jose medellin in violation of an order by the world court would be a major step backward for the rule of law
1314337 if the united states ignores its legal obligations in this case it will be tough to argue that other countries should respect the rights of us citizens

1314343 zuerst beim thw kiel und gleich danach gegen den hsv handball schlimmer konnte es nicht kommen
1314344 es k nnte in der tat ein vorteil f r uns sein dass hamburg noch kein spiel absolviert hat der hsv hat zwar eine der besten mannschaften der bundesliga aber die sollen erst einmal zeigen was sie k nnen
1314345 der hsv hat praktisch zwei aufstellungen sie sind auf jeder position doppelt stark besetzt gegen kiel hatte ich unsere chance auf einen sieg bei 20 prozent gesehen gegen den hsv sind es 30 prozent wenn wir in beiden halbzeiten so eine leistung bringen wie in kiel in der ersten halbzeit werden wir das spiel gewinnen
1314346 letztes jahr war kein zusammenhalt im team das sah in kiel anders aus melsungen hat eine mannschaft f r einen platz im gesicherten mittelfeld
1314347 wir spielen zwei mal in der saison gegen den thw eventuell zus tzlich im pokal und in der champions league aber es darf nicht an allen 34 spieltagen der bundesliga ein fernduell sein und ja der thw ist auch zu kriegen
1314348 dass es nicht die optimale position f r mich ist
1314349 das umfeld des hsv ist f r mich die nummer eins in deutschland
1314350 er ist ein weltklassespieler von ihm habe ich viel gelernt
1314351 we have a better team than the team i have left bolton there is a lot of talent there i already see some very good signs from the team and were playing some good football
1314352 if there is anything that needs to improve i think we need to be focused a little bit more because the goal we conceded against ajax we need to concentrate a bit more if were going to make sure we dont concede goals like that during the season
1314353 he certainly can play a part in it he is different from the rest of the strikers hes young hes hungry he has the desire
1314354 the manager has signed some very good players i see them in training every day and can see that theyre very talented footballers
1314355 ive had two good seasons but youve got to keep challenging yourself as a player to keep progressing and hopefully this season i can push on again
1314356 playing in europe is a big boost to everyone at villa but it also means you are playing against different systems and players which presents a challenge in itself
1314357 you play against quality players in the premier league but europe will be different again
1314358 if i can play a bit in europe this season hopefully it will help me stay in the england squad and that i can win the first cap
1314359 im sure as time goes on well have a chat about it at some stage well see but first and foremost im here to play football for him not to talk about youth academies
1314360 it wont be used as a feeder academy though no ive set it up as the first ever football academy thats free of charge to scout kids from around the world
1314361 weve just had our first two players signing professional contracts with a club in belgium
1314362 this doesnt mean that ambani isnt interested in investing from his personal wealth outside his company
1314363 we see love and death and tales of lives that are raw and rich
1314364 they make us laugh and cry and laugh again allowing us to understand and expand on the riches of romani music and history and letting us enjoy knowing the bands intimately
1314365 it would be great if by experiencing the romani people and their music people can learn more about them and understand that what youve believed about these people has been a lie your entire life
1314366 we are not very aggressive in acquiring new land to boost our land bank
1314367 i think we would invest rs 400 rs 500 crore out of internal accruals depending on liquidity to acquire land in this financial year
1314368 construction for most of the sezs will start in two months
1314369 of the nearly 300 property developments from 20 indian cities being showcased just half a dozen ahmedabad properties were on offer yet they witnessed the maximum response
1314370 after the us sub prime crisis nris h ave become more bullish on india where they see better future appreciation and with realty still going cheap in ahmedabad it is now catching their fancy
1314371 going around town you do see some people who have ignored our request to stop using their sprinklers and that and washing their vehicles
1314372 our water consumption has dropped from over 2 300 gallons a minute to down around 15 16 1 700 mark which is a whole lot better than it was but its still not as low as it should be
1314373 in the summer months were prone to wash our vehicles more often were prone to take more showers and that leads to more laundry and when you see this sprinkler watering a lawn morning noon and night thats an abuse of water
1314374 its bad were turning off sections of the town periodically throughout the day and night
1314375 its been really bad this past week but its been looking unfavourable for the past couple of weeks
1314376 theres going to be a great lineup of local entertainment with special guests
1314377 the navigators are coming out from st johns theyre one of the top celtic bands on the east coast right now theyre our headliner
1314378 we decided to go with using different venues around town to give them a bit of business and cut down our overhead a bit where its our inaugural festival
1314379 next year were hoping to expand on it but for now were just flying by the seat of our pants here now
1314380 we havent lost sight of the youth weve done a couple young folk at the hall workshops and well be doing more of that but this time around were focusing on the adults
1314381 the danger is that the fish will usually not be able to get past the blockage when they are heading up stream to spawn because it acts as a dam
1314382 also fish that get trapped in these pools will stay there in times of low water and when the swimmers return they are stressing these fish sometimes unintentionally and sometimes intentionally these fish are usually resting in these pools and due to high water temperatures they cannot stand great amounts of exertion because the water contains very little oxygen
1314383 we have a really bad scenario happening here now with a large amount of returning salmon probably the best return in numerous years but the water levels have dropped and now these salmon are stranded in the rivers until we receive enough rain to get them moving
1314384 these two rivers have been closed to angling for some time in hopes that the salmon population would return to a sustainable harvest level
1314385 it is our job to protect these fish and this is done through education but also can be done through enforcement
1314386 people that intentionally try to harm these fish will be dealt with by the enforcement approach but hopefully we can educate enough people about these fish and the need to protect them that they will become true stewards of the resource and do what is necessary to help them survive
1314387 the bottom line is this administration has moved towards barack obamas positions

1314409 with the government of irelands aggressive target for 33 of energy consumption coming from renewables by 2020 and our high ranking queue position for one of irelands largest proposed wind farms the cloosh valley wind project can be a significant contributor to achieving these targets we are working with the potential joint venture partner towards executing definitive agreements that would enhance finaveras experienced wind energy team as the project proceeds with an anticipated in service date in 2011 we can look forward to erecting our first wind turbines on a project that could provide power for over 60 000 irish homes and over 400 million euros in estimated gross revenue during the life of the project

1314411 the world is your oyster when it comes to the sorts of things you can do with clothing and technology youre only limited by your imagination really
1314412 your whole body can be equipped with an array of sensors
1314413 if clothes could talk they could tell us so much about our bodies
1314414 they are an interface between our bodies and the environment and in the future will prove a vital tool in health care we are creating clothing with sensors that does not intrude on the comfort of the patient with wires
1314415 this is an entirely new area but every day we are discovering ways of adding new functions to textiles it has so much potential our clothes will definitely play a very different role in the future
1314416 in these cases wearable monitoring systems even if less accurate can help the physicians get additional information they would not have without them if the patients are away from the hospital
1314417 this specification might have certain additional requirements on character encodings image formats audio formats and video formats in the respective sections
1314418 it would be helpful for interoperability if all browsers could support the same codecs however there are no known codecs that satisfy all the current players we need a codec that is known to not require per unit or per distributor licensing that is compatible with the open source development model that is of sufficient quality as to be usable and that is not an additional submarine patent risk for large companies
1314419 if you dont revert you will be giving us independent authors the shaft and we will remember it forever
1314420 there are unimplemented bits bugs etc that need to be sorted out but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release
1314421 i suspect that the effects of this will take a long while to be felt but its a great first step in bringing open video to the web by delivering it to a couple hundred million people around the world
1314422 the debate turned a corner last december when the world wide web consortium apparently backed down from its plan to enable default codecs for its planned video and audio tags in html 5
1314423 the knockhill circuit is a fantastic venue with a real rollercoaster of a track that suits the seat leon cupra race cars but is a very long way to come for some of our competitors to help them in making the journey we are delighted to offer them this bonus thanks to our partnership with dunlop
1314424 knockhill is a great circuit and always provides a warm welcome but it is a long and expensive journey for many competitors particularly at present given the business we enjoy and the close relationship we have with seat sport uk and the teams we are delighted to help them with free tyres
1314425 one of the main reasons for the trend is financial difficulties arising from credit card spending overdrafts and other debts resulting in people taking insolvency advice comparisons with the early 90s are ill founded people are taking a view that they may as well going into less expensive rented accommodation than spend all of their income on mortgages and secured loans that will take a lifetime to pay off
1314426 people realise the repossession process will affect their credit rating but they are not too worried about that as most have serious debt problems anyway
1314427 the whole process of repossession turns secured debts into unsecured ones if advice is taken early by taking out an iva or going bankruptcy then losses can be mitigated the worst thing to do is bury your head in the sand the debts wont go way unless you deal with them
1314428 assurenet gl will provide us with better visibility and control were adopting what we believe is a best practice solution to strengthen our control processes

1314432 we selected splunk above all other contenders to assist us in our pci compliance initiative because of its ability to collate and report on any form of log file or data stream we require
1314433 this gives us highly granular logging information and enables us to turn any data into a concise management report the ability for a number of members of it staff to have controlled access to the solution also frees up the core it teams time to focus on other issues which is another real economic benefit for the group
1314434 the challenge of complying with the pci data security standard dss mandate is a difficult and moving target as pci continues to evolve and it infrastructure keeps changing working with gala coral group to slash operational costs reduce the risk associated with its 1bn pound sterling business and achieve ongoing pci compliance demonstrates the power of it search as the new weapon for datacenter management
1314435 splunk lets it operations security and compliance teams across the enterprise more cost effectively manage complex rapidly changing it environments

1314463 help advertisers understand how video on demand can be integrated effectively with their broadcast tv campaigns
1314464 in our experience public sector workers are already leading their private sector counterparts in adopting new technologies but there is obvious demand to go a lot further
1314465 why buy from a supermarket when fresh produce from local farmers is cheaper and delivered to your door on the hour
1314466 theres enough technology acumen amongst home grown companies in this country to make a real difference to the governments ailing it
1314467 it departments hear facebook and clam up but theres more to social networking than just consumer sites public sector workers already know that efficiencies can be made with using collaborative technologies for work so its time that it heads caught up

1314474 black professionals have to monitor their behavior etiquette on the regular professional level and at the same time through this racialized set of expectations

1314485 how many other innocent lives are being squandered by the inaction of agencies assigned to protect them and by parents who have about as much business raising children as i have raising llamas

1314496 we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1314497 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
1314498 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
1314499 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
1314500 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
1314501 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
1314502 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1314503 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1314504 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1314505 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1314506 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1314507 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1314508 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1314509 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1314510 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1314511 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1314512 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1314513 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1314514 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1314515 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
1314516 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
1314517 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
1314518 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
1314519 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
1314520 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
1314521 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1314522 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1314523 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1314524 insa daca exista si barbati care iubesc un astfel de design noi nu o sa zicem nimic si o sa livram comanda
1314525 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1314526 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1314527 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1314528 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1314529 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
1314530 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1314531 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1314532 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1314533 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

1314538 the table rose into the air and headed south with pancakes jam fruit and flowers punch and sweets and also the muskrats book which he had left on the corner
1314539 now i should like my book spirited back again please
1314540 but this is the wrong book the one i had was about the use less ness of everything
1314541 hes the wrong way up here in the southern hemisphere
1314542 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
1314543 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1314544 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1314545 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1314546 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1314547 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1314548 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1314549 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1314550 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1314551 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1314552 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1314553 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1314554 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
1314555 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1314556 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1314557 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1314558 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1314559 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1314560 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

1314563 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1314564 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1314565 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1314566 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1314567 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1314568 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1314569 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1314570 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
1314571 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight

1314582 weve a reasonably strong balance sheet and were not looking at this stage to cut the dividend but if we stayed for the whole year at like for like sales of 15 down wed have to look at it very carefully

1314584 tasers have contributed to resolving incidents without injury where otherwise there would have been a real possibility of someone being seriously injured or killed
1314585 in a significant number of cases they have not needed to be fired drawing or aiming the taser has been enough of a deterrent
1314586 i hope they get the feeling they arent alone grieving it is the city the nation the entire globe
1314587 it really helped to have a lot of people around us
1314588 a lot of people wanted to come here i think its because in part people want to see justice done
1314589 after studying the schedule of madrid and the dutch team i realised playing for both would mean too tough a load for me
1314590 im taking no chances and after the enjoyable euro 2008 finals i can look back upon my decision with a good feeling
1314591 i had a comprehensive conversation with ruud and i can do nothing else but respect his decision
1314592 i regret it that i cant use his quality and experience when i compose my squad but i wish him all the best at real madrid
1314593 real madrid and hamburg have reached an agreement for the transfer for five seasons of dutch player rafael ferdinand van der vaart
1314594 the agreement is subject to the players medical examination and his signing of a contract
1314595 last night everything came together and i am now moving to real madrid
1314596 as everybody might know i have always wanted to move to spain because i have a strong bond with that country now im going to play for real madrid its a dream comes true
1314597 this will be the start of a new chapter in my life i will do everything to help the team and the club to win trophies
1314598 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
1314599 hes got incredible skill he has magic and is capable of anything on a football pitch his quality is amazing it would be great if he joined us and hed be made very welcome here
1314600 the first rule for winning football is to make sure we play well but for all that well try to play good exciting football our opponents are always going to be trying to stop us from doing that
1314601 sometimes the games wont be as spectacular as wed like
1314602 thats just the way it is but this team has players with great quality who can play high calibre football good quality and exciting football
1314603 its the responsibility of all the players to play exciting football but im more than happy to assume that role ill take on the role of making the football exciting very happily
1314604 why is getting obama to disclose his legal clients like pulling teeth
1314605 if the hiss doesnt tell you its a snake then the fact that it slithers on its belly in the dirt should
1314606 ive been working my entire adult life to help build an america where economic justice is being served and as president well ensure that economic justice is served thats what this election is about
1314607 from each according to their ability to each according to their need
1314608 if we invest in our families and in ordinary americans by helping them go to college with tax cuts for 95 percent of families to reward them for hard work and give tax cuts to help them save for retirement such are the ways everyone can have a stake in our economy
1314609 we americans cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times
1314610 we dont need a black man to be president so badly that it forces us to take leave of our senses
1314611 michelle obama says her overriding role will be to serve as
1314612 the region has become a global centre for science and innovation and this decision will help colworth science park to secure its position as one of the leading locations for research and development within the east of england
1314613 the new business and lab space to be developed and the new relationships established with the two universities will appeal to researchers and scientific organisations around the world
1314614 the three fugitives were cuban nationals not citizens of the dominican republic the dominican authorities deemed them persona non grata and expelled them to the united states
1314615 it seems to me that our thinking has to change that someone from cuba can flee back to cuba just like someone from mexico
1314616 whether someone can be categorized as a political refugee when you can pick up and go back
1314617 dollars do and the governments allegation is that dollars are the result of medicare fraud
1314618 the drug traffickers get paid in cash so they have to find businesses and other ways to launder it
1314619 considering the heavily state controlled nature of cubas financial network its very unlikely that these medicare funds are being moved through the formal banking system
1314620 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1314621 i live so far below my means that it doesnt really register
1314622 in one fell swoop i pay for the roof over my head the food in my stomach and the lights to read by thats a big advantage
1314623 the economy starts to tank people get tired of it
1314624 its people saying lets get together and help one another and it works
1314625 were pretty isolated from the ups and downs of the regular economy
1314626 you dont have to chase as many dollars to have a quality of life
1314627 it isnt just cutting back on things its about people not needing so many things and putting more attention into their personal interests and their family and friends being creative being of service
1314628 for me to be able to walk out my door and have everybody in the hall know me thats a really great experience
1314629 and if anything happens to me i know theres somebody next door wholl take care of me
1314630 as part of our share in tackling climate change camden council works with and encourages all our contractors to make sure they are providing services that are as sustainable as possible
1314631 the gas we use to make the cbm for this vehicle comes from a landfill site in albury surrey which began production in june 2008 in creating and selling this fuel product we recover the latent energy stored in material discarded by society providing power particularly suited to vehicles operating in the urban environment
1314632 cbm has excellent potential to provide at least some of our vehicles with a fuel that reduces climate change impacts and contributes to reducing our dependence on mineral fuels we have to look at environmentally friendly alternatives for our operations and gas powered vehicles are one of those developing technologies we are keen to assess
1314633 this is the first new generation iveco daily in the uk to be built as a dedicated natural gas vehicle and is subjected to all of the same build quality standards as one of our line built diesels amongst a whole wealth of environmental benefits its natural gas powered engine means that it is immune to both current and future oil price fluctuations
1314634 the side effects bible the dietary solution to unwanted side effects of common medications
1314635 this could be a big reason why we have what we call the walking wounded and why so many people on drug therapy are having so many problems
1314636 its very simple most doctors consider vitamins and nutrients a waste of time
1314637 second of all theres not enough health education in the field
1314638 when i did a presentation at walgreens and rite aid they said well our pharmacists dont have time
1314639 its not like the old days where they can counsel patients
1314640 you have these millions of people on statin drugs i dont have to tell you how many millions they are all getting their coq10 depleted
1314641 and the major side effects from statin drugs are liver problems and also statin induced myopathy which is muscle pain and weakness other problems include fatigue and memory problems
1314642 the doctors and the pharmacists are not educated in drug induced nutrient depletion its not talked about
1314643 why arent people told this stuff why isnt your doctor or pharmacist telling you that your drug depletes zinc out of your body its because vitamins arent deemed important unless its very very well known doctors are clueless they think drugs and surgery can solve all of the problems that we have
1314644 ill show them a list of the potential depletion problems of their drug and theyll say oh magnesium depletion can cause muscle cramps and depression
1314645 and theyre reading all of the depletion problems and theyll say oh thats me
1314646 i see it in my practice on a daily basis oh doc im on lipitor or im on vasotec or wellbutrin or vioxx and i dont feel well and we feel that its not all drug induced deficiencies but in part its side effects seem to be related to nutrient deficiencies
1314647 hopefully therell be some education the book which i wrote did ok it wasnt a best seller like some of my other books
1314648 this touches all of society you have a group of very middle class people in their 30s who thought they were having a good time they ended up having an extremely traumatic experience
1314649 i know how cheap drugs are you can get a bag of speed for 10 to 15 its as cheap as chips you can buy ecstasy tablets for a few quid
1314650 if you can get drugs for the price of a round of drinks people particularly younger people will want to try them while ignorant of the dangers
1314651 i wanted to write a story about a family going through the great depression and having a good life
1314652 readers can learn from the history seeing how people lived back then its so different than how people live today
1314653 but i thought its so boring no one would want to read it
1314654 as a kid i didnt realize we were in a great depression
1314655 one thing they can learn is how a family can work together how kids can help and not feel like it was a burden
1314656 maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible over southeastern texas
1314657 we looked for common changes in the genetic code that were more frequent in people with schizophrenia than people without it among the genes we found the evidence for the gene called znf804a was particularly strong we now need to determine the identity of the genes that it can switch on and off finding out which ones are regulated should tell us a lot about what biochemical disturbances result in disease and provide further vital clues into the origins of schizophrenia and hopefully new ways of treating it
1314658 we were driving from our home in ramallah to a cousins wedding in jenin with our three daughters sitting in the back we had to turn around because of engine trouble and as we passed the yitzhar settlement junction we saw four people on the road my wife said watch out but it was too late a large slab had been thrown through our windshield
1314659 he the settler dropped it right on us my wife made a sound and began bleeding i stopped and then decided to continue to hiwwara checkpoint outside of nablus as i opened the car doors my daughter fell out injured the slab had made it all the way to the back windscreens
1314660 she had such positive energy if you werent shed brighten up your day

1314960 as has been widely observed histories of feminism have often been conceived via notions of generation where feminism is positioned as a kind of familial property a form of inheritance and legacy which is transmitted through generations thus feminism and its history have been imagined as following a familial mode of social reproduction despite the dominance of this model it has nonetheless been subject to critique not least because of its reliance on teleological and progressive notions of history judith roof for example has called for new conceptualizations of temporality in an attempt to decouple histories of feminism from a generational model this need to move away from a generational model is also underscored by what commentators such as angela mcrobbie have identified as a dispersal of feminism a broad scale circulation of feminist values in popular culture as well as by the emergence of a certain kind of reflexivity whereby past and current feminist practices are increasingly subject to critique for mcrobbie such developments are understood as part of the articulation of a post feminism in which feminism can no longer be passed on as it is positioned as having already passed away however in this article via an exploration of recent accounts of the passing of feminism it is suggested that what allows for a declaration of this passing is an attachment to feminism as a particular way of knowing as well as to a particular arrangement of the social indeed it will be suggested that recent histories of feminism and commentaries on the state of contemporary feminism are driven not only by generational logics but also by these attachments attachments which lose and fix both feminism and women in time

1314978 never start a business because others are doing it or because you want to be a millionaire or you dont want to work for anyone or you loss your job and you are searching for a secured occupation or you just came about some money you have just got a great idea or you want to keep busy
1314979 you should start a business because it is what you want to do it must be that you observed a need or an opportunity and you have the passion experience skills and persistence to make it work let it be that you want to make a difference to raise the standards build business from start to good level this means you want to make the business outlive you through an execution process that links three core processes such as strategy people operations to ensure policies are efficiently implemented at all times
1314980 i studied that system parliamentary at its best and also studied the other system presidential in the united states for some months and i think that basically the parliamentary system is superior that is my judgment any way having seen them both at work in foreign countries i dont think it is an accident that if people are fed up with a prime minister the head of government in england or other places where it is practiced they vote against him and throw him out but if you are really fed up with a president in the united states you kill him that is what they do so all those are things we must bear in mind
1314981 the prime minister is answerable every day he goes to that place parliament and issues will be raised and he responds but the other man president no he doesnt even go there parliament look at what we just passed through under obasanjo anytime he visited the house he could not be subjected to any questioning then how do you now ask somebody to be accountable for what he does even a minister here is not a member of the house so where will you ask him and who is going to ask him i think it is wrong i dont think the presidential system is very suitable for us
1314982 he is a returnee and there are procedures of admitting such members back to the party and above all it is too sensitive for chief nwobodo to lead such a sensitive committee
1314983 for lasting peace and unity of the party for equity and fairness the only recommendation that the committee could make was to dissolve all congresses from wards to the state level and call for fresh elections

1314995 about 45 million americans do not have a bank or credit union account denying them access to basic financial services with these federal resources mainstream institutions will be better able to bank the unbanked this bill will also encourage banks and credit unions to provide an affordable alternative to predatory payday loans which typically carry exploitative fees several credit unions have developed similar products including the windward community federal credit union in kailua hawaii which used a federal grant to develop an affordable alternative to help the u s marines and others they serve more working families need access to affordable small loans
1314996 at a time of rapid innovation in the financial services industry it is discouraging that a so many americans remain disconnected from the mainstream system of banking and finance the sad reality is that in many low income neighborhoods the primary source for financial services is storefront check cashers rent to own shops money transfer operators and payday lenders charging predatory interest rates the legislation we are introducing today will help bring low income communities closer to the retail financial services and savings opportunities they desperately need
1314997 a bill like this has been a long time coming it will promote a culture of saving by encouraging more people to open bank accounts this bill will also help families get out of the cycle of debt caused by payday loans
1314998 given the economic struggles currently confronting our nation this legislation can help many americans by bringing families without bank accounts into the mainstream of our nations financial system i believe this bill will help many families build savings and improve their credit risk profiles that will lower the cost of payment services and eliminate a common source of personal stress enabling more people to be a part of our mainstream financial system whether through a credit union or a bank will build the right financial foundation for many families

1315061 to nie by a zwyk a lista os b z kt rymi spa am to by a raczej praca na temat prywatno ci

1315063 try telling bob dylan bruce or billy joel they cant sing whats in their soul
1315064 like lonelygirl15 gemini division is a female first person confessional in this case about biotech run wild dawson plays anna diaz a new york city detective having a crazy fling with a guy whos tall blond and ripped and a little bit off
1315065 theres another couple of targets we are looking at and we hope to bring them through the door in the next couple of weeks
1315066 at the end of last season i thought we needed another top striker at the club and ive not changed that view because youve got to put the ball in the back of the net
1315067 what more do i have to do to get picked
1315068 its disappointing that i have not made the main squads i feel that i am good enough
1315069 i think i have been playing well in the county championship the pro40 league and in the twenty20 cup and i deserve a little bit more than this
1315070 weve knocked back three bids from plymouth and are now in discussions with danny over a new contract
1315071 hes indicated hes willing to sign and hopefully we can conclude that before the end of the week and have danny tied up on a longer term deal
1315072 i have had a couple of setbacks recently but thats football
1315073 there is no point starting to panic and bringing in two or three new boys who dont fit in to what we are trying to achieve
1315074 im trying to bring a certain style of player into the football club which cuts down your selection
1315075 kevin pietersen now stands at a crossroads in his life as well as his career
1315076 being england captain will take up more time than he can imagine and he will need to reconsider his whole outlook
1315077 within the game worldwide he has a reputation as being an individual but to be successful a leader must be a giver not a taker to his team fringe players sponsors the public everyone
1315078 the wasps captaincy is probably one of the biggest challenges of my career so far
1315079 we have a fantastic squad and im very proud to lead this group of players
1315080 muslims and jews and christians used to interact in a mode of genuine respect and friendship
1315081 a robust and reliable network is at the heart of everything we do at
1315082 i want to go to chelsea in the same way that ronaldo wants to come to madrid it is the same thing
1315083 robinho is a spectacular player hes got incredible skill he has magic and is capable of anything on a football pitch
1315084 his quality is amazing it would be great if he joined us and hed be made very welcome here
1315085 i want to go to chelsea in the same way that ronaldo wants to come to madrid it is the same thing
1315086 hes got incredible skill he has magic and is capable of anything on a football pitch his quality is amazing it would be great if he joined us and hed be made very welcome here
1315087 the young players were fantastic and young rafael the right back was a sensation for me
1315088 i thought it was a real eye opener for us he hadnt played for a year but hes played a full 90 minutes today his brother fabio has played 45 minutes and hes also done well so were really pleased by their contribution
1315089 you know what footballs like sometimes it turns up some star some little nugget maybe on the evidence of tonight i think we have got a good player here
1315090 bmx is a fantastic sport to connect with the youth and to have the world leader in shanaze is really exciting
1315091 so british cycling didnt want to leave any stone unturned to ensure she returns with the gold medal
1315092 there is one similar track at the uci headquarters in aigle but in olympic year the world wants to train on it so we decided to build our own
1315093 we found the spare ground approached manchester council to use it and set about building ourselves a track
1315094 we contacted the guy in america who built the one for the games in beijing he jumped on a plane came to the uk and now we have ourselves a great facility
1315095 its vital because that is what i do i go from the start and win my races from there
1315096 bmx is extremely difficult and probably looks easy when people watch the likes of me winning like i do
1315097 i just want to keep winning more and keep resetting my boundaries and keep pushing myself
1315098 the girls at the bmx worlds in 2007 started to get close to me because maybe i got a little complacent not intentionally but i have now picked it back up again
1315099 my coach grant white has helped turn me around and give me the motivation i need he tells me it is just isnt about winning but about pushing yourself as far as you can
1315100 i did track cycling to prove that bmx cyclists werent just people on kids bikes and to show that we are athletes
1315101 i think i have done that by setting world records on the track and winning two golds in two years
1315102 i think with the media coming on board and taking an interest in my story that is helping to make bmx grow
1315103 he is a consistent scorer and a solid player but he is a team player and a leader as well
1315104 he is similar to pat dwyer from last season and will like pat be very good for our young players to learn from
1315105 you could count on him without hesitation on the court because he did it every day in practice
1315106 during practice he was the one to get us going he was really intense with everything he did a leader in every way possible
1315107 nates had a presence on the team and on campus from the moment he arrived
1315108 hes an energetic guy he brings a positive spirit to practice and to campus and hes been a lot of fun to coach because of that
1315109 david likes london and likes how spurs play under ramos if they present an offer valencia will seriously study the subject
1315110 the names theyre the names youve heard menez and benayoun are both top class players
1315111 it is not true that i am about to leave anfield
1315112 i see my future at anfield i want to stay and that is what will happen
1315113 the names theyre the names youve heard menez and benayoun are both top class players

1315122 ive been very impressed with him and im pleased that weve got him here
1315123 i like him very much hes a good kid and hes got the potential to become a very good player
1315124 someone rung me and recommended him we got him down here and we liked what we saw straight away
1315125 theres a big gulf at the club between senior players and young kids weve got nothing in between really but i think he can bridge that gap
1315126 hes played out wide and through the middle for us in pre season but hes a forward player really
1315127 ive been very impressed with him and im pleased that weve got him here
1315128 i like him very much hes a good kid and hes got the potential to become a very good player

1315178 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive

1315221 i was sitting down eating my supper six oclock and i got a phone call quarter to eight from a lady crying saying she couldnt get out of her house
1315222 i knew the rain was falling very heavily but i didnt realize it could build up so quickly
1315223 they had to go get one lady in a canoe she got out of her house and she went out in her car she stayed in her car until they came and picked her up in a canoe
1315224 we have a slight problem every year everybody has a problem of some sort with flooding in spring but what we had was a very very unreal amount of water falling
1315225 one place the hill down below the trans canada rocks came down and just about buried a guys half ton pickup
1315226 ive never seen nothing like that in my life its unbelievable you cant even describe it
1315227 i was up to my knees in water down in his basement he was at his place until 5 30 this morning pumping water out of his basement he had to go glovertown to get a pump last night
1315228 by seven oclock the ditches were totally flooded and the brook was starting to overflow on the lawns
1315229 then the next thing i knew the water started coming in under the house i got concerned then and turned the power off
1315230 we had an older car that we had there for sale when i went back to get that one it was too late the water was over the seats
1315231 theres about 7 1 2 8 feet of water in my basement
1315232 all my appliances are gone all my kids toys are gone
1315233 at least we still have a home were with the mother in law so we got a roof over our head a lot of people here had three or four feet of water in their living room at least out house isnt like that
1315234 my house never got damaged but my next door neighbours did
1315235 all these people who are affected are good friends of mine so i still got that stomach sick feeling
1315236 people are thinking a little bit broader and reaching out to neighbouring communities looking for complements because tourists want to stay in the region and we want to keep them here
1315237 say you were a bakery and you want to start exporting your baked goods off the island and into a market like alberta we could get the people that are in that type of business to collaborate and share services like marketing materials or booths at trade shows so they would come together look at opportunities for exploring other markets and instead of all of them individually having to absorb costs we could do that as a collaborative effort
1315238 we identify that there is a need still further for communities that arent connected and we keep our ear to the ground for funding that may become available or whats required to access funding for these communities to be hooked up
1315239 its just such a good resource tool for any type of collection of marketing information or advertising she said
1315240 i think the operators are identifying that tourists want a higher end product
1315241 they want an adventure they want to come to places where they can participate so i think what youll see in tourism is less coming in and looking but more experience based tour ism
1315242 they are coming back with a lot of ideas and outside the box thinking and theyre excited to return and participate
1315243 2009 it does not provide any other clues as to what the project could be about so as of now it is unknown as to whether or not it will be a dtv or theatrical release
1315244 e nos banhos de sol n o poder o ficar ao lado de detentos de fora do regime diferenciado

1315246 we roll out to a fire call one oclock in the morning
1315247 every time we take a truck on the road were risking firefighters
1315248 they could have an accident going through and while theyre at this one there may be another at opposite end of town thats a real fire
1315249 ive talked to several chiefs across the island about it and theyre all having the same concerns he said
1315250 coming out of nova scotia ive heard theyre having the same problem up there it creates a lot of headaches and its doing the same right through the maritime provinces
1315251 its crazy because in the case of most of the departments in our province theyre volunteer departments
1315252 this could be happening in the afternoon or the middle of the night which means volunteers have to get out of their beds or leave what theyre doing go to the station take the equipment go check it out only to find out that this is totally preventable
1315253 if the battery packs in the system fails or is weak then that will set off the alarm system as well just a couple months ago that was happening to us once or twice a week and we had to get someone down and thats what it was the rechargeable batteries giving us trouble
1315254 they pop the batteries out theyre changing their batteries which is nice but its at the expense of their local fire department
1315255 because the minute that they do that without notifying the alarm company the alarm comes in and its treated then as a full blown alarm and the fire departments are dispatched
1315256 if you take the batteries out it sends a different reporting code than it would if it was a fire
1315257 it would send a trouble signal without dispatch to the fire department and it would say smoke detector upstairs hallway not communicating
1315258 on the initial installation the company should test every device
1315259 they should check trouble signals programming an upload and those should be run through to the monitoring station
1315260 a lot of people just forget about that theyre being monitored by an alarm company
1315261 if theyre home cooking and they set off their smoke detectors they dont bother to call the fire department or the alarm company to let them know the alarm company dispatches us and they phone the home owner and they say everythings ok but by then we already have trucks through the doors
1315262 these alarm systems are tied in to the telephone line
1315263 when the system is activated it cuts in and dials a predetermined number and in most cases its up in calgary somewhere and they have no idea whats going on and while the system is dialing it renders the telephone useless for someone to pick up the phone and say im sorry i accidentally set the system off when this is all taking place of course the fire department is being dispatched
1315264 at the end of the day theyre making a pile of money and its left to the poor volunteer fire departments then to look after it and thats wrong
1315265 we in the fire service certainly arent condemning the fire alarm systems
1315266 but with that comes a certain level of responsibility and a lot of people arent being responsible
1315267 make sure youre buying quality use professionally recognized companies learn how to maintain them and get them serviced
1315268 in particular the nba must reject this affront on the judiciary by the attorney general
1315269 the justice of this case is that parties to this suit should maintain the status quo so that the subject matter will not be destroyed
1315270 the subject matter is southern bakassi which is to be ceded by the defendants on august 14
1315271 it is hereby ordered that parties should maintain the status quo and should not take any step pending the hearing of all applications
1315272 a court order must be so explicit to the effect that the person who is bound by it should be able to comply
1315273 in this case the order poses a dilemma because it does not state which status quo to maintain at the time it was enrolled by the judge
1315274 the status quo that i know is that there is a judgment of the international court of justice at the hague which the federal government had partly implemented and must implement completely
1315275 to file the necessary motions to overturn the ruling and i think he will do that on friday
1315276 our country has a commitment to hand over the peninsula by august 14 and so far nothing has changed
1315277 if there are legal hurdles the president is fully committed to addressing those hurdles so that the handover can go on as planned nigeria will not abandon its sovereign responsibilities and international obligations
1315278 it is known fact that about 90 per cent of the bakassi returnees are indigenes of this state since this crisis our people have been living in shanties and in abject poverty because resources released for their resettlement have been channelled to the wrong quarters
1315279 hes a very good excellent dancer ill tip my hat to tom
1315280 the fact that he came in and in six days of shooting made that kind of impact id say per hour he was the big winner in tropic thunder
1315281 we knew we were locked into an r rating from the language in the beginning of the movie anyway from all the war movie dialogue
1315282 ive never seen anybody get so animated over butts and elvis as those two
1315283 she cant wait to get back home and read her boyfriend jamie hinces cheeks although she doesnt know how to broach the subject
1315284 im actually terrified when he takes me on a drive especially through the canyons in los angeles wow hes at one with his car lets just say that
1315285 i am returning to the states to work on my new single and album lewis will be focusing on racing i dont think we will have much time to see each other before christmas
1315286 consider the case between lagos state and federal government and you will see how clear it is we also have the supreme court judgment in our hands which clearly says that the creation of local governments is subject to the approval of the national assembly
1315287 we got a security threat yesterday from hezbollah that our embassies in west africa will be attacked
1315288 we do not want to be a target because they did not mention any particular country where they plan to attack our embassy
1315289 israel is ready to train nigeria police officers especially on how to handle emergencies and mass casualty situations because of our more than 30 years experience in handling such situations
1315290 i am extremely happy with the level of security we get from the police and other security agencies we are satisfied and we have confidence in you
1315291 the struggle beyond the creeks of niger delta so that the politicians who populate abuja can have a feel of the misery that the people of niger delta live with
1315292 we have seen the threat but we are studying it so we cannot comment on it for now
1315293 the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta mend serves notice today sunday august 3 2008 to german construction firm julius berger plc to vacate the federal capital territory of abuja in line with their policy of withdrawing from areas of harassment in nigeria considering the incident on friday august 01 2008 when one of its vehicles was burnt by an irate mob in abuja
1315294 had this same scenario occurred in the niger delta region the army would have been called upon to open fire on the mob and brand them as militants
1315295 mend expects julius berger a company which has benefited tremendously from the niger delta region where its crude oil was used as barter payment in most cases for the building of abuja to apply the same policy of leaving troubled areas as it did when it recently quit the niger delta region
1315296 failure to vacate its staff from construction sites and halt all on going projects in the fct abuja from august 11 2008 will result in unprecedented deadly attacks on the expatriate staff of julius berger inside abuja and other parts of the country until they comply no hostages will be taken
1315297 for us in pan ocean we regard this health clinic project on which we have expended over n50 million as another landmark contribution towards the socio economic development of our foremost host community it is our fervent hope that the community will reciprocate this gesture by talking good care of the facilities provided and jealously guarding them against vandalism theft as well as harassment of the staff that will be deployed to provide services at the clinic bearing in mind the multiplier effects of its presence to the entire community as a whole and in line with the old adage which says health is wealth

1315304 for now were focused on the video game application for epoc but we see possibilities beyond this such as market research or health care
1315305 often when companies make products that are comfortable and easy to use by the public interesting applications on the medical side
1315306 anything like that would require approval from the which takes years
1315307 but the possibility is there if simply from a cost standpoint our product is in the hundreds whereas most eeg machines cost between 50 000 and 250 000
1315308 im not sure its at the point of being as precise as it would need to be
1315309 i dont see it being a mainstream device in this form that said its certainly beyond a gimmick game issues aside its uncanny
1315310 when the item on screen did what i thought it to do it was surreal
1315311 this is science fiction stuff emotiv has jumped the first hurdle in simply making the device now they have to make it work with most games if they do this could hit the jackpot

1315317 das co2 aus dem rauchgas kann mit hoher wirkung ausgeschieden werden

1315332 on my part i assure you that the government will act on it expeditiously without delay i intend that by next week this document would be placed as a memo adopted by the minister of energy for consideration and passage by federal executive council and that will form the first critical step for the implementation of the recommendation of the report
1315333 we will also engage immediately in undertaking critical steps to consult the national assembly leadership and also create the opportunity for committee to interact with the senate and house of representatives committees on nergy and other stakeholders so that like you suggested there would be a total buy in by all stakeholders it is important that nigeria as a nation indentifies itself fully with the reforms that we intend to do as recommended by this committee

1315366 indeed all of us know that other national oil companies that have come into being after our national oil company are now by far ahead of us because they have restructured and operating in a manner that this report proposes to organize our petroleum sector and have a truly national oil company that will be commercially and profit oriented and that will compete with other national oil companies elsewhere in the world
1315367 we have provided for the incorporation of the loose joint ventures that are operating in the oil industry into proper joint venture companies not only to make them more efficient and transparent but also to raise whatever fund they require from the money market like other oil companies do without the oil industry having to turn to the coffers of the federal government to finance their operations

1315395 this attitude on the part of bjps central leadership is not understandable elections will come and go political parties will come and go but no political party should cross the lakshaman rekha to meet their political goals at the cost of unity of the state and country

1315419 we place emphasis on applied sports psychology in our programs in other words the psychology of human potential and performance

1315421 they harbor expectations about the outcome of the game from themselves or from their parents or peers people tend to worry about things they cant control they worry about whether theyll win or make the shot instead of focusing on effort attitude and motivation
1315422 this is the paradox of control and paradox of success the way to give yourself the best chance of achieving success is to stop thinking about it if you focus instead on things you have control over you can increase the likelihood of success
1315423 parents can help kids re focus to things like energy effort and concentration
1315424 if someone is upset over a loss you can ask are you upset because you did all you could and you lost or because you didnt do all that you could and you lost
1315425 a parents primary question after a game teaches the child what is important
1315426 its far better to ask did you have fun or what did you learn than did you win when parents value improvement and fun over the score of the game the child begins to place more emphasis on learning and enjoyment the shift emphasizes the process of the sport rather than the results of the game it comes back to placing value on things that the child can control
1315427 the benefit of screening at this time is uncertain and if there is a benefit its likely to be small

1315444 were small and were best explained by common genetic factors with opposite effects on exercise behavior and symptoms of anxiety and depression
1315445 in genetically identical twin pairs the twin who exercised more did not display fewer anxious and depressive symptoms than the co twin who exercised less
1315446 it is unknown which genes might be involved in voluntary exercise behavior and in the risk for anxiety and depression
1315447 only voluntary leisure time exercise is influenced by genetic factors whereas the other type of exercise directed and monitored by someone else is environment driven the absence of causal effects of voluntary exercise on symptoms of anxiety and depression does not imply that manipulation of exercise cannot be used to change such symptoms
1315448 the antidepressant effects of exercise may only occur if the exercise is monitored and part of a therapeutic program

1315496 el tema que da t tulo al lbum es un regalo para nancy en el que hago un resumen de lo que he vivido y es tambi n un regalo para m porque me dediqu y disfrut componiendo y afinando cada detalle de esta canci n
1315497 se trata del autor que se sienta en el portal y revisa las etapas que han pasado y ve con cierta nostalgia inevitable las sombras de todo lo que fue por muy optimista que uno pueda ser y yo soy un hombre muy optimista siempre hay un momento en el d a en el que la nostalgia te invade y recuerdas los momentos gloriosos o los fracasos y de aquello queda la sombra que cargas a tu espalda
1315498 yo creo que es un momento de mucha expectativa porque ya se anuncian reformas y el estado reconoce p blicamente los errores es hora de que se den los cambios que el pueblo cubano reclama desde hace muchos a os
1315499 si no paseo por el malec n me enfermo tengo que ver ese sol tengo que ver ese mar y tengo que ver a la gente sobre todo a la gente
1315500 por historia y por cultura el pueblo cubano es eminentemente revolucionario como lo soy yo ahora los cubanos est n desesperados porque se den esos cambios y el estado lo est notando
1315501 si fidel ha renunciado al poder no absolutamente porque todav a es secretario del partido pero renunci a la presidencia y a la jefatura del consejo de estado y todo eso se hizo en paz si ra l asumi esos poderes si ha habido cambios en la estructura del poder del pa s sin sangre y sin guerra creo que esta transici n se puede dar en paz
1315502 por muchos errores que se hayan cometido esas victorias hay que resguardarlas lo que ser a intolerable es vender el pa s o regalarlo y traicionarlo
1315503 pero detr s de ch vez han venido una serie de presidentes por los que siento una simpat a extraordinaria aunque tengo inquietudes responden al anhelo del pueblo latinoamericano de un viraje a la izquierda en busca de justicia y de libertad
1315504 esos l deres deben tener mucho tacto para manejar el poder que les ha dado el pueblo porque pueden presentarse obst culos por parte del imperialismo
1315505 si no me paseo por el malec n me enfermo
1315506 el enemigo m s grande de la libertad de prensa no es un estado que censura un propietario monop lico el anunciante que quiere una cobertura favorable o al menos la ausencia de una cobertura desfavorable sino un periodista o editor cobarde que no necesita que le digan lo que debe hacer pues ha internalizado sic la necesidad de agradar o al menos de no ofender a la pero tiran a de todas la de cierta opini n p blica que considera que su logro m s alto es saberse cubrir las espaldas

1315508 los intelectuales de izquierda admiran a bin laden que este se ha convertido en el nuevo che guevara
1315509 el desastre de irak es un trago amargo pero yo sigo defendiendo la invasi n porque solo as ganaremos esta guerra
1315510 chistopher hitchens es un provocador nos lo anunciaba honestamente otero en la entrevista ya citada siempre le ha gustado ir en contra de la corriente mayoritaria y quiz s por eso oh qu extraordinaria sorpresa es que ha dejado de ser un intelectual de izquierdas como todo el mundo critica ahora a bush l por llevar la contraria lo defiende

1315513 im able to give him some pointers about what to expect and to alleviate some of the fears and some of the doubts and reassure him that everything is going to be fine
1315514 ive been able to kick back and relax and go through the whole process with my mom so its been great
1315515 its a little bit challenging but i think its exciting to know that ive still got it
1315516 its an excellent opportunity for my wife in terms of completing her education and for my son for discipline starting life off on the right track and not a lot of debt for school
1315517 because i already know what to expect i dont have a lot of concerns for his safety im confident in the training he will be receiving

1315520 people have a hard time adhering to diets and our research shows that choosing eggs for breakfast can dramatically improve the success of a weight loss plan
1315521 apparently the increased satiety and energy due to eggs helps people better comply with a reduced calorie diet
1315522 eggs are a good source of all natural high quality protein so they can help keep you satisfied longer making it easier to resist tempting snacks
1315523 nearly half of an eggs protein and many of the other nutrients are found in the yolk so make sure to eat the whole egg for maximum benefits

1315531 what makes this data so disturbing is the clear and unexpected finding that dating abuse and violence begins at such a young age
1315532 the best way to do this is to mandate this in my estimation
1315533 were fighting for generations here and generations yet to come to end this scourge
1315534 teens have a right to know this and parents have a right to know as well

1315538 i am looking forward to the 25th telstra art award which will be the silver jubilee for the awards
1315539 it provides significant exposure for indigenous artists from across australia who in many cases come from remote and isolated communities
1315540 this year there were 307 entries and the calibre of the works was absolutely outstanding
1315541 the panel had extreme difficulty in determining what would be exhibited there were over one hundred participating artists
1315542 the event attracts entrants from around the country and is known for its diversity and innovation in contemporary indigenous art
1315543 my winning sculpture was a hand carved bronze crocodile this has never been done before
1315544 sono molto soddisfatta per come sta procedendo il progetto pochi giorni fa stata siglata una partnership con oxfam oyip che voglio ringraziare per il sostegno e per la disponibilit per la preparazione delle attivit congiunte per i prossimi mesi
1315545 il progetto sta prendendo via via sempre pi forma si creato tra i partecipanti un network di discussione sulle varie situazioni che coinvolgono i paesi presi in esame ed bellissimo vedere la vivacit con la quale si discute di possibili soluzioni e progetti da avviare abbiamo inoltre organizzato una chat tra i partecipanti e janeen heath del pulitzer center on crisis reporting ed stato un momento davvero formativo durante il quale si discusso di etica del giornalismo e comunicazione istituzionale mi auguro che questo tipo di attivit possa essere daiuto ai ragazzi coinvolti affinch possano anche dopo la fine del progetto continuare a stimolare lopinione pubblica sui temi inerenti la situazione politica dei loro paesi
1315546 the new vehicles will be used alongside our light armoured vehicles in places like afghanistan
1315547 the m 113s have been rigorously tested and subsequent modifications have been made
1315548 there was some over heating of the engine and the brakes were insufficient for such a heavy vehicle

1315553 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
1315554 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
1315555 i think this is half baked i dont think were ready for it i dont think the people want it
1315556 i dont know whos going to do it be justice minister because weve not been involved in any discussions on it it appears the alliance havent been properly involved in discussions on it i dont believe the sdlp has
1315557 so how you can announce an agreement without other parties being involved in it escapes me
1315558 a blind one legged monkey could now orchestrate these regular farragoes
1315559 we took these risks and decisions in the name of peace and progress
1315560 northern ireland is crying out for bright young politicians with new ideas and fresh thinking yet how would they ever get a foot on the political ladder when every run of that ladder is occupied by greedy politicians with dual and even triple mandates
1315561 they the dup and sinn fein really ought to consult with us before they spin about us
1315562 i think there is this idea that they can rely on us to ride to the rescue well they can t expect that when they haven t spoken to us on the issue for the last 16 months
1315563 we have been given the job to provide an effective opposition by the electorate and the fact is this is an incoherent and incompetent executive and my party will play no part in that
1315564 the reality is the executive in place has failed to tackle a range of problems from education to rural planning to the irish language and the proposed maze stadium
1315565 and the thought that they need us to take on a department they can t deal with on top of all the others they ve been unable to deal with properly is just bonkers
1315566 he loyally and steadfastly preaches the gospel but he doesnt shove it down our throats we get on well with david
1315567 i have never felt self congratulatory in any way about my involvement because it did precipitate a conflict which eventually claimed 3 500 lives and that is inescapable
1315568 it would be very cruel to say that what we have ended up with is a twilight home in east belfast for retired gunmen but are relations today between the communities really that different
1315569 im just not convinced that the outcome we do have is any better than what we wouldve had had the march not went ahead
1315570 the thought that this would lead to a re emergence of militant irish nationalism which would in turn bring about the resurgence of militant loyalism would simply never even have occurred to us
1315571 what this was about and what it has returned to was equality of citizenship history will record the provisional iras campaign as a continuation of the civil rights movement by inappropriate means
1315572 between the pomposity of bew and the extravagance of mccann i might look like the sane one
1315573 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing children
1315574 we havent budgeted this year nor done them in the past
1315575 we surveyed residents at the start of this year who said they wanted the clean up but were not prepared to pay for it
1315576 darwin city council has been organising a cyclone clean up for years palmerston has failed to identify residents needs
1315577 it is difficult for people to take big items to the local dump if they do not have a trailer or ute
1315578 people know that there is no cyclone clean up but are leaving stuff on the street and hoping someone else will pick it up
1315579 i am concerned northern australia has already experienced the first cylone of the season people need to get their houses in order
1315580 la nina years on average have seen more cyclones than normal which is a bit of a risk for darwin
1315581 we want to create resources that the local community can use to strengthen youth participation
1315582 darwin has the youngest population in the country but the voice of our youth often goes unnoticed
1315583 the office of youth affairs believes that 12 to 25 year olds are entitled respect diversity access empowerment equity and coordination
1315584 most stories you hear or see in the media about youth are negative achievements are rarely reported
1315585 i am not sure if it is this way because the community wants to hear bad youth stories or if it is the media institutions agenda
1315586 youths what will they know we are not considered credible
1315587 job i was talking about is none other than wnv the reason why im classifying this as a half job is because i dont feel as motivated working for them anymore like how i felt in february or march and the reason wangbo of course thanks for draining away all my motivation bitch
1315588 i have never seen anything like it it was absolutely packed and everyone was a bit frantic
1315589 i thought something must be going on when these same guys kept going back to the cash machine and then making loads of calls on their mobiles
1315590 within minutes the place was packed with people and there was a huge queue at the machine
1315591 loads of folk were being dropped off in cars and it was causing a traffic jam i went outside and asked them what was going on but no one would admit to it because they thought i was going to phone the bank
1315592 after about half an hour i got a call from the bank informing me that they were closing it down
1315593 its extremely difficult to get to the earnings per share number of 2004 anytime soon
1315594 god has not promised skies always blue flower strewn pathways all our life through god has not promised sun without rain joy without sorrow peace without pain
1315595 the candle for tibet initiative is a most wonderful thing
1315596 we seem powerless to ameliorate conditions on the ground in the present crisis moment this peaceful prayer vigil since it focuses the minds of many millions on the different sufferings of tormented and tormentor alike is a powerful way to intervene and it does not preclude anything else we can think of and do further on i hope everyone who reads this will join in this important effort
1315597 congratulations my friends for this fabulous action in favour of freedom in tibet special thanks to mr david califa for his dedication and his creativity thank you to all the members of candle4tibet for their generous and tireless efforts
1315598 we can hardly keep up with the flow of incoming events
1315599 we have vigils in virtually every major city in the world the beauty of it is that we organized none of them it is truly a peoples protest
1315600 mr thurman and mrs rouxs support of our efforts is very inspiring
1315601 it reinforces the importance of our non violent action and the power it will have for the people of tibet
1315602 by and large the list underscores nigerias desire to try new options against the backdrop of the super eagles having already picked a ticket for the third and final phase of qualifying which begins in march 2009
1315603 i have been playing in england for the last four years and i think that every year i have improved including the last 12 months at chelsea
1315604 there is always the desire to keep on improving all professionals think that way you have to keep learning and getting better and i am sure i will do that my best years are still ahead of me
1315605 i played 22 times for chelsea which wasnt bad given the rotation there and the size of the squad obviously though i am looking forward to playing more at city
1315606 i am not taking anything for granted because there are good defenders here like micah richards and richard dunne but i do not see why we cannot all play together and be fantastic for the club
1315607 in terms of my fitness the game at stockport was my first for this season but i felt not too bad and hopefully i will get another outing at celtic park
1315608 oh hell no you just didnt say what i think you said
1315609 undertake the next level of study of the feasibility of this potential toll project
1315610 i am confident that by maintaining a high profile presence on the estate our officers can have a significant impact on the number of offences committed
1315611 we are determined that law abiding residents should not have their quality of life affected by a criminal minority
1315612 we look forward to seeing an end to the brain drain where many young people travel outside of the borough to study
1315613 i was contacted in 2005 by a student who was furious that he had to travel to oldham for his sixth form education he quite rightly argued that we should have a decent facility in the centre of rochdale and thats where this campaign sprang from this confirmation is another step towards seeing that dream become a reality
1315614 i have considered the proposal and am pleased to give approval
1315615 doesnt make sense if it costs 20 rupees to collect 25 rupees
1315616 its all about reach and cost and operational reasons make it difficult to reach these people
1315617 the carriers could be the mfis but you dont want to take away from the mfis
1315618 they serve the customers and theyre part of the last mile to the customer they offer services beyond transactions theyre underwriting loans and coaching customers having the mfi play an active role with the poorest people is great because theyre not comfortable with credit and savings the mfis make the approach to the poorest people that much better and it helps them understand how to use this powerful new tool
1315619 and that is to bring the peace not in the flower but the as salaam alaikum in the third i am

1315622 there will be games that will be enhanced by the wii motionplus as well as games that can only be played with it users will need four if they have four controllers but were going to try to offer it for as little as possible we havent announced the price yet but the cost of making the wii motionplus is not that much so i think we can make it very affordable

1315626 i am reminded of a particularly chilling passage in vladimir nabokovs novel
1315627 obama is the ring and we are the fellowship of the ring it makes sense once you understand that the ring was evil and the purpose of the fellowship was to destroy it even though it was pretty and tempting and its hard to actually destroy something that might be useful
1315628 theres a little poem inside that ring one ring to rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
1315629 the fellowship us was a brave bunch of ordinary people who saw that
1315630 the area boasts diverse marine life and virtually untouched flora and fauna only 50 kilometres from darwin
1315631 the report they submitted last november rainforest to reef just 40 km from darwin highlighted the cultural and environmental significance
1315632 industrial development would have potentially destroyed 4 000 hectares of pristine woodland rainforest marine and mangrove habitat
1315633 we are delighted that glyde point is now protected from large scale development
1315634 we also look forward to our ongoing work to secure the integrity of darwin harbour and its surrounding environment
1315635 we do much of our campaigning through talk back programs on local radio stations
1315636 we began the search at 8 30 on sunday morning around the area where a rucksack belonging to the man was found we believe the man is in his late 50s and from the rochdale area of greater manchester he was staying at a campsite but hadnt paid his fees for some days crews searched the main gully on the east face of tryfan where the body was found camouflaged beneath the heather and bracken
1315637 the bellamack land release will ensure darwin remains the second most affordable city in the country
1315638 successful applicants from the first round of the expression will undergo further assessment
1315639 the land release was announced back in may yet it has taken this long just to reach the first round
1315640 there is enormous demand for housing right now we are encouraging the nt government to work faster
1315641 i have a deposit and pre approved loan with the bank but am forced to rent until more land is released
1315642 friends of mine are in the same situation and i suspect many more because rents keep going up
1315643 it is good that we no longer have to pay for stamp duty on houses under 350 000
1315644 wii music completes what miyamoto wrote in his proposal when he came up with the idea for the wii
1315645 he was saying that he needs to think up more ideas now
1315646 the cost of making the wii motion plus is not that much so i think we can make it very affordable

1315648 were still in the middle of negotiations with simon walton as i have been with a lot of other players throughout the summer
1315649 i dont like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal as if he were a person who should be persecuted
1315650 those who should be persecuted are those who sell the substances those who give it away those who traffic in it
1315651 decriminalization of the consumer should include what are called second generation human rights but at the same time there should be a strong policy of prevention so that no one falls in the situation of consuming any substance
1315652 the evidence generally shows that the decriminalization of possession is not clearly associated with any increase in illicit drug use
1315653 a few years ago then mexican president vicente fox proposed decriminalizing possession of drugs combined with a crackdown on traffickers but a harsh reaction from the bush administration caused him to retreat
1315654 brazil and colombia have passed laws decriminalizing drug use in an effort to combat the spread of hiv among injecting drug users
1315655 politicians recognize that you basically need to get those people out of the underground and into health systems
1315656 this would be part of a growing number of countries in latin america where there is either for political or judicial reasons a push toward decriminalization of personal possession sometimes combined with initiatives to crack down harder on bigger drug traffickers
1315657 it typically involves both lessening the criminal sanction for possession of cannabis while also providing for alternatives to incarceration for people addicted to drugs who are arrested for drug possession or other minor offenses
1315658 we parents like to believe that as we keep up with our childrens shoe sizes taste preferences and favorite music that were also staying hip to their latest jargon
1315659 often i wonder whether kids frequently change their stylistic verbiage just to keep us parents guessing
1315660 want to go to cold stone for some ice cream their cookie dough flavor is wicked tasty
1315661 im not going to announce numbers ill only state that the offer is far from what espanyol is asking
1315662 were in no rush well see what benfica do from here
1315663 the decision will be reached by benfica making a final offer and us giving our answer which will also be final
1315664 dadurch dass einige sportarten vor allem schwimmen bereits zwischen 03 00 und 08 00 stattfinden wollten wir unseren zuschauern die m glichkeit geben auch im nachhinein auf die sendungen zugreifen zu k nnen die f r sterreicher interessant sind
1315665 das war das zugest ndnis des ioc an die rechteinhaber in den usa diese bezahlen viel geld f r die bertragungsrechte und wollen sportarten mit hoher medaillenchance auch zur prime time senden
1315666 das ist eine rechtefrage die bertragungsrechte und damit auch die f r das internet wurden l nderweise vergeben
1315667 dadurch dass noch immer einzelne rechte ungekl rt sind werden wir in sterreich nicht zu den olympischen spielen mit unserem programm an den start gehen
1315668 still think marxism and socialism have social value when those ideas were the inspiration even if wrongly interpreted for thugs who engaged in the killing of tens of millions of innocent people and the destruction of the economies of billions
1315669 hes a fantastic player and an important player for us
1315670 i hope he can score a lot of goals for liverpool and that i can play alongside him many times
1315671 weve only been training together for a few days so its not a lot of time but the important thing for me is that he is always talking during games
1315672 the understanding between us and steven gerrard is important as well he is the midfielder who is passing the ball to myself and robbie and so the more training we do together the more good things we can do for liverpool
1315673 it was perfect to score my first goal because thats always important for strikers ive only been training for one week and so its understandable to feel tired
1315674 the idea is to arrive fit and ready for the start of the premier league season
1315675 among the teachings of the tendai sect of japanese buddhism is one about three thousands realms in one mind this is the idea that the action of ones mind in a single instant contains three thousands realms or the entire universe and therefore if our mind acts it can affect the entire universe
1315676 we are what our thoughts have made us so take care about what you think words are secondary thoughts live they travel far
1315677 the humane quality of understanding the suffering of others and wanting to do something about it

1315680 more people are struggling to meet their mortgage payments and it is vital that firms treat them fairly
1315681 this means paying attention to their individual circumstances and not repossessing their homes when there may be an alternative solution repossession has to be the last resort

1315684 it is important for the american people to know who is responsible for the energy crisis we are all facing the democrats
1315685 what did the democrats do while the pelosi premium went up they declared national passport month but wouldnt have a vote on energy in may we voted on national train day but not energy holds a gas can this is a gas can an empty gas can as empty as the democratic partys ideas on energy on filling this can they dont know how to fill it their only idea is 5 gas holds up a new helical light bulb the democrat energy plan is to outlaw incandescent light bulbs but not vote on a comprehensive energy policy
1315686 take a note of a name ram n masats the most complete spanish photographic enthusiast he s ace he is going to paris to talk with ernst haas and cartier bresson to see if he can get into magnum
1315687 one day might seem short but inspired by the buddhist belief behind william blakes poem to see a world in a grain of sand and heaven in a wild flower i thought that one day of photographing will hold both certainties and uncertain coincidences
1315688 turn away from sin cease offending my son build a chapel etc
1315689 my soul proclaims the greatness of the lord he who is mighty has done great things in me
1315690 god does not desire the death of a sinner but that he be converted and saved
1315691 i cancelled all that debt of yours when you appealed to me were you not bound then to have pity on your fellow servant just as i had pity on you

1315694 the large hadron collider lhc a 27 kilometer 17 mile long particle accelerator straddling the border of switzerland and france is nearly set to begin its first particle beam tests the european organization for nuclear research cern is preparing for its first small tests in early august leading to a planned full track test in september and the first planned particle collisions before the end of the year the final step before starting is the chilling of the entire collider to 271 25 c 456 25 f here is a collection of photographs from cern showing various stages of completion of the lhc and several of its larger experiments some over seven stories tall over the past several years
1315695 i wanted to get out and walk southward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time i tried to go i became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me back as if with ropes into my chair
1315696 how many of us are able to distinguish between the odors of noon and midnight or of winter and summer or of a windy spell and a still one if man is so generally less happy in the cities than in the country it is because all these variations and nuances of sight and smell and sound are less clearly marked and lost in the general monotony of gray walls and cement pavements
1315697 uhm i r change mind me and teh whitey r goin to bail
1315698 the greatest challenge is making our positions attractive for aboriginal and torres strait islanders to apply
1315699 we have an affirmative action policy with cathy freeman as our cultural ambassador to promote indigenous employment
1315700 it demonstrates a commitment to our staff and australian people as a whole we put our staff through cultural awareness training to increase opportunities for indigenous people
1315701 aboriginal kids arent finishing higher education therefore are not going through to employment
1315702 the other reason is alcohol related family breakdowns because most kids in urban centres are offspring to the stolen generation
1315703 participation rates will increase if equal opportunities are promoted along with traineeships that bridge the education gap
1315704 this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people
1315705 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30 why not nip things in the bud
1315706 we showed that the tests could be successfully accomplished despite damage to these brain regions

1315722 the people of palmerston are hearing about the library via positive word of mouth
1315723 the artwork culture and heritage section and living room layout all set the new library apart from the previous one
1315724 i can not comment on the old library i have only been to the new one
1315725 my kids love it and constantly ask me to take them i enjoy it because i can read with my son while my other son attends education programs
1315726 the computer rooms should be bigger and separate so that students using the library are not distracted
1315727 i was always mature for my years because of the parental part of it ive seen up close what effect those things can have i would never want to put myself in that situation it would be very careless and just not smart at all
1315728 tags are the origin of modern graffiti and have always fascinated me especially because i was to personally witness the late prime time of tags as well the main phase of classical graffitis in early eighties new york i remember the common picture of subway trains covered in tags spreading symbols and gang messages as they rattled through metropolitan new york the mother of todays metropolis eventually gaining art status graffiti was domesticated today as a result urban graffiti art is subsidised and cultivated almost academically tags on the other hand have remained unchanged in their rudimentary impetous common simplistic name signatures and symbols of the seventies such as taki183 or vo73 are still sprayed as territorial demarcation lines of human existence
1315729 the sentiment is more bearish now than before as concern over slower u s economic growth is weighing on demand
1315730 the last commodity sell off of this magnitude in march 1980 unfortunately did little to the severe 1980 and 1981 1982 recessions
1315731 nonetheless this commodity sell off may help corral the disconcerting inflation pulse of the past year and eventually allow central banks the luxury of again easing to help stimulate economic activity
1315732 the tug of war between upside risks to inflation and downside risks to growth will persist in the coming quarters in our opinion the growth outlook will remain too troublesome to allow the fomc to hike interest rates anytime soon
1315733 police are always being called out ndash daily sometimes several times a day
1315734 the place has also been raided with police going in with dogs and police cars blocking off the escape routes most of the time its the same few characters who get moved on but keep coming back
1315735 we get the drug addicts coming in and shoplifting they are quite intimidating
1315736 they used to deal drugs in the toilets here but when i started working here we got rid of them by putting in security cameras and locking the toilets
1315737 the worry is that drug dealers will move to another betting shop
1315738 we have nearly 2 300 shops across the country and unfortunately on occasions we will get people in our shops who misbehave or engage in criminal activity

1315741 iside seduta che tiene sulle ginocchia il figlio segna il definitivo passaggio dal simbolo steatopigio del corpo femminile espressione della potenza creatrice allo stato puro gravidanza incubazione farsi energetico e nascosto nel grembo forno al simbolo della maternit dove il prodotto venuto alla luce ha preso le sembianze del figlio maschio che si in sediato sul suo grembo che tra poco si trasformer in astratto trono su cui il potere maschile potr sedersi da solo ed questa diade madre figlio che arriva direttamente a noi attraverso le figure della madonna con il figlio in braccio ancora oggi limmagine sacra pi comune e diffusa perch ancora viviamo in quellaura culturale
1315742 alla fine del neolitico nellet del rame quasi ormai nellet del ferro quando arrivano gli indoeuropei compare una nuova associazione di animale con la dea quella dellavvoltoio
1315743 un passaggio ulteriore in cui si fa strada una formulazione pi astratta pi separata dalla naturalit del ciclo della terra
1315744 neolitico agricolo e sedentario che sviluppa larte della ceramica la madre ora snella e le sue storie si combinano con quelle delle prime forme maschili del dio rappresentato come spirito della vegetazione che ciclicamente nasce e muore
1315745 dea della morte annuncia la morte come passaggio per una nuova rigenerazione avvoltoio e corvo e la pi esplicita connessione tra lavvoltoio e la morte era gi raffigurata nelle pitture parietali dei santuari di catal huyuk
1315746 altro simbolo ricorrente la dea civetta anche questa frequentissima la civetta un uccello notturno il cui canto che turba il silenzio della notte era ritenuto un annuncio di morte
1315747 associate con la dea compaiono ora le zanne di cinghiale che hanno il potere di uccidere perch il cinghiale uno degli animali pericolosi uno degli animali che uccidono osiride viene ucciso da un cinghiale cos come attis
1315748 si sviluppa la raffigurazione della dea della morte che ha bocca larga zanne e talvolta la lingua pendula come nelle gorgoni greche che erano simboli terrificanti e avevano il potere di trasformare gli uomini in pietre forse i simboli della gorgone e della medusa furono elaborati in risposta allimpatto dei guerrieri a cavallo venuti dalle terre di nordest quando teseo tagli la testa della medusa croll una delle ultime difese dellantica visione del mondo
1315749 e dalle prime quattro forme dalle prime quattro linee si diramano poi quelle che condurranno alle molteplici figure non pi una dea dalle molte funzioni come era ancora nel neolitico ma molte dee ricche di storia di miti di fare
1315750 corni o falci di luna che molto spesso sono interscambiabili semicerchi a u ganci asce itifalli e naturalmente limmagine del serpente ripetuta infinite volte spirali e serpente a confondersi una nellaltro

1315838 we realised that the workload after the second technical rehearsal was enormous which was surprising there was a bit of a gap where we figured out what we needed to do next i expected the work to be steady but there was a trough for a week or two where we were reviewing the results of the technical rehearsal and after that it was very busy

1315864 youve been a rather naughty boy going through these records ive found a few discrepancies such as the time you managed to put under your pillow the total of fourteen teeth which you got by knocking out those of your fellow school friends
1315865 then there was the occasion when you pulled out the teeth of your recently dear departed friend mr meep
1315866 not only did you make money underhandedly on those occasions there was also the time you tripped your rather down the stairs for his teeth and also stole your grandparents false teeth for your own ill gotten gains
1315867 but the lowest of the low was surely breaking into the local dental surgery and making off with every false tooth and denture you could lay your grubby little mitts on eep
1315868 to whit mr pratchett i have worked out that you owe the sum of 405 620 dollars how mr pratchett do you propose payment of such monies
1315869 how about making a donation to the orangutan foundation mr pratchett what do you say to that

1315895 this is what i will do i will pull down my barns and build bigger ones and store all my grain and my goods in them and i will say to my soul my soul you have plenty of good things laid by for many years to come take things easy eat drink have a good time
1315896 fool this very night the demand will be made for your soul and this hoard of yours whose will it be then
1315897 lassana is a bit behind the rest in terms of general fitness
1315898 he needs to be ready for a week on sunday not necessarily wembley
1315899 he did everything at training so wed expect that hed play
1315900 he just jarred himself up a little bit and simmo was a bit the same just at the end of the game there were no other real issues with the injuries
1315901 people should not touch it or attempt to pick it up by the tail as these snakes do bite
1315902 we believe the snake will be looking for a damp dark and warm location and as it had been recently fed it will be fairly lethargic they are also excellent swimmers
1315903 ive never played corner before but i played linebacker in high school youve got to be so athletic and its very hard to play i was just really trying to adjust to it
1315904 it kind of feels like a transfer its a new birth the coaches have a new excitement about me and its like i changed teams
1315905 were going to bring a lot of speed to the outside thats going to surprise a lot of tackles
1315906 my leverage being able to get up under some of those tackles is big too
1315907 in the spring we had a real need for linebacker due to some injuries
1315908 i just wanted to help the team out the coaches thought because of my special teams play and maybe my more aggressive nature that i might be able to fit the bill to be a maybe a backup or a reserve linebacker
1315909 the way our tight ends set and their alignments i was telling e j wilson the other day that when they have a wide gap theyre going to try to inside release me
1315910 being on offense youve got to be a student of the game and study the whole offense
1315911 its not just learn your position that sort of carries over to help you on defense you can recognize stuff
1315912 now i think i understand defense better and playing offense for the first two years of my career here has somewhat helped my progression at linebacker
1315913 you really need reps just to get down what the reads are the fits are the different idiosyncrasies of it
1315914 they told me about it beforehand so that i could dedicate my summer conditioning to get ready for this challenge
1315915 we used to always think of this industry as the cycle
1315916 i think the reality now is there are several sub cycles
1315917 its hard now to talk about the cycle i think we have to talk about all of the cycles
1315918 three can keep a secret if two of them are dead

1315923 this was a disgraceful and criminal campaign aimed at intimidating candidates and voters and subverting the democratic process it is vital that david cameron takes action to determine why watford conservatives failed to investigate the matter properly and to ensure that such an appalling course of events is never repeated
1315924 to ensure that such obviously unsuitable individuals are no longer selected as conservative candidates

1315927 mcc footed much of the bill for parrinellos trips for a total of more than 9 000
1315928 parrinello was a logical choice to represent the college not because his son is the coach but because parrinello is a loyal follower of the team
1315929 its a stretch to say thats necessarily in the interest of the college instead of the interest of the individual
1315930 educating both parents and children about the meaning and practicalities of age recommendations implemented by the pegi system is absolutely key to ensuring that children only play video and computer games that are suitable for their age group

1316113 the wine trials 100 everyday wines under 15 that beat 50 to 150 wines in brown bag blind tastings
1316114 most wine in the world is cheap wine its only in the last 10 years or so that wines over 50 have taken off its really a success of marketing not taste
1316115 there have always been good wines and better wines but the luxury products manufacturers and the mass brands got really smart about marketing their products
1316116 i was trying for a broad swath of wine drinkers
1316117 what this proves to me is that people should do blind tastings and find out what they like
1316118 i think the worst cheap wine is the mass produced wine that is trying to imitate the expensive international style the best cheap wine is one that is just trying to be itself a nice table wine thats refreshing or well balanced or has a nice acidity
1316119 but i wanted to make sure that the wines were readily available

1316123 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1316124 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1316125 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1316126 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1316127 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1316128 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1316129 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1316130 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1316131 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1316132 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1316133 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1316134 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1316135 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1316136 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1316137 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1316138 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1316139 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1316140 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1316141 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1316142 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1316143 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1316144 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1316145 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11

1316149 without aggressive action and political commitment the number of vacant properties could quickly increase beyond the reach of local programs

1316172 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
1316173 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists synthetic molecules that mimic the action of natural molecules are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy

1316199 vallen eenvoudigweg niet te ontkennen het is een combinatie van overeenkomende karakters en overeenkomende levens die hebben geleid tot een zelfde radicale visie op muziek een visie die gekenmerkt wordt door een allesoverheersende haat jegens het jodelen waar die haat precies vandaan komt valt moeilijk te achterhalen zowel hitler als mohammed b verkeerden tijdens hun jeugd in kringen waarin het dissen van jodelaars een populaire bezigheid was maar van beiden was niet te voorspellen dat hun haat tot zulke gigantische proporties zou uitgroeien het is bekend dat de dokter die hitlers moeder op haar sterfbed heeft begeleid een verwoed jodelaar was er wordt wel eens beweerd dat hitler die dokter de dood van zijn moeder heeft verweten en dat zijn haat daar zijn oorsprong vond maar dat zijn slechts speculaties
1316200 de vroegtijdige dood van hun moeder is overigens wel een belangrijke schakel in het radicaliseringproces van zowel de jonge adolf als mohammed beiden waren namelijk extreme moederkindjes moet u weten het wegvallen van hun moeder betekende voor beiden het wegvallen van de zin van het bestaan ieder probeerde op zn eigen manier deze leegte op te vullen hitler zocht zijn heil in het schilderen mohammed ging werken als vrijwilliger bij eigenwijks een organisatie van samenwerkende wijkbewoners van slotervaart alleen voor beiden gold dat ze hopeloos mislukten in het waarmaken van hun ambities hitler werd meerdere malen afgewezen op de kunstacademie mohammed moest lijdzaam toezien hoe het mede door hem opgezette jeugdhonk werd gesloten grote frustratie was het gevolg twee losers die opereerden in de marges van de samenleving en wier levens gedoemd waren tot onbeduidendheid totdat de wereldgeschiedenis zich met het zaakje ging bemoeien
1316201 in de zomer van 1914 zet de grote oostenrijkse glamrocker franz ferdinand een solo in die later onder de naam world war part i zou uitgroeien tot een vier jaar durend project waaraan alle grote namen uit europa zouden deelnemen bij de totstandkoming van dit project speelde hitler een kleine doch voor hemzelf niet onbelangrijke rol als geluidstechnicus en in september 2001 worden de hitparades bestormd door de invloedrijke doomhop formatie the base onder de bezielende leiding van mc osama hun hitsingel the ballad of the twin towers slaat wereldwijd in als een bom en raakt overduidelijk een snaar bij de gevoelige mohammed b hij raakt onder de indruk van de boodschap die osama uitdraagt langzaam maar zeker gaat mohammed zich kleden en gedragen naar de richtlijnen zoals uiteengezet door osama tijdens diens afghaanse periode toen hij een van de achtergrondzangers was in de invloedrijke band mujahedien gevolg is dat mohammed uitsluitend in witte jurken gaat lopen zich een baard aanmeet en afstand neemt van zowel het vrouwelijk geslacht als van alcohol
1316202 en zo stuiten we op een volgende zeer opmerkelijk overeenkomst tussen hitler en b
1316203 oh ja de cruciale fase in beider levens ze lieten voorzichtig van zich horen hitler in optredens om en nabij m nchen als lid van de n s d a p der neue shake deine arsche posse en mohammed als tweede violist bij da hoffstad group een bont gekleurd doomhop ensemble onder de even bezielende als geheimzinnige leiding van een syrische mc echter beiden hadden te maken met rivaliserende groepen die meer airplay kregen hitler moest concurreren met door lenin and the bolsjewist beinvloede duitse hardcore formaties en mohammed b werd van de hitlijsten gehouden door succesvolle artiesten als eerder genoemde fat pig theo en l a h liberals against hoofddoekjes de succesvolle groep van missy ayaan en thfkagw the haircut formely known as geert wilders hun door de jaren 80 ge nspireerde new wave viel zeer in de smaak bij grote delen van het nederlandse publiek sommigen beweren dat wild wilders enkel en alleen door zijn opmerkelijke kapsel zo populair is geworden maar die hebben geen verstand van muziek

1316205 het moment was rijp om toe te slaan beiden wisten dat ze niet langer mochten wachten hitler maakte in 1923 furore met de singel coup soleil en belandde in de gevangenis mohammed b bracht eenmaal in bloed gedoopt ten gehore en werd eveneens achter slot en grendel geplaatst het was toen dat de carri re van hitler pas echt in een stroomversnelling kwam wat de toekomst voor mohammed in petto heeft valt natuurlijk niet te zeggen ik heb me in ieder geval wel laten vertellen dat hij momenteel een remix aan het maken is van een van hitlers grootste successen het conceptuele album mein kampf in de bewerking van mohammed b zal het my jihad gaan heten hetgeen zoals u ongetwijfeld weet precies hetzelfde betekent

1316207 the sentiment is more bearish now than before as concern over slower u s economic growth is weighing on demand
1316208 the last commodity sell off of this magnitude in march 1980 unfortunately did little to the severe 1980 and 1981 1982 recessions
1316209 nonetheless this commodity sell off may help corral the disconcerting inflation pulse of the past year and eventually allow central banks the luxury of again easing to help stimulate economic activity
1316210 the tug of war between upside risks to inflation and downside risks to growth will persist in the coming quarters in our opinion the growth outlook will remain too troublesome to allow the fomc to hike interest rates any time soon

1316215 the hardware team started work on the next thing as soon as they were done with their previous project but what they think up doesnt necessarily become a product
1316216 we only turn something into a product after its been thoroughly vetted inside the company were not at a point where we can give specifics but of course were working on it
1316217 we used to always think of this industry as the cycle i think the reality now is there are several sub cycles its hard now to talk about the cycle i think we have to talk about all of the cycles

1316220 frankly i think that a lot of the intellectual property we create are better than the licenses that doesnt mean there isnt room for great licenses theres room for both
1316221 i think what youre noticing is that in years gone by we havent had as many great original intellectual properties theres a lot more of that this year from ea and i think from here forward
1316222 i think what redeems our industry is quality and i think we take a step back every time we take a license and exploit it with a crappy game thats not what were about
1316223 the encouraging thing is that a lot of people seem to be in favor of
1316224 i saw on the internet comments that a lot of users seem to feel that
1316225 its been months since it came out and multiplayers kind of held on to that there are still some things you can go back and do like the hitman stuff theres some racing activities you can do you can shoot pigeons if you want but beyond that theres not that much replayability

1316231 we understand what steam is we dont want steam to go away well they might want steam to go away but theyre not asking us to make steam go away
1316232 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
1316233 w e as catholics believe catholics can and should vote for barack obama because his platform aligns well with catholic social teaching

1316238 today i endorse barack obama for president of the united states
1316239 i believe him to be a person of integrity intelligence and genuine good will
1316240 and it is important for every life to be given sustenance and encouragement
1316241 in various ways sen barack obama and i may disagree on aspects of these important fundamentals but i am convinced based upon his public pronouncements and his personal writing that on each of these questions he is not closed to understanding opposing points of views and as best as is humanly possible he will respect and accommodate them
1316242 the first thing id do as president is sign the freedom of choice act

1316257 a lot of ipcc estimates are heroic first approximations and should be seen as a starting point not as received wisdom
1316258 from a scientific perspective green carbon accounting and protection of the natural forests in all nations should become part of a comprehensive approach to solving the climate change problem
1316259 protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity
1316260 if natural forests continue to be cleared and degraded then the carbon dioxide released will significantly increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
1316261 to date in climate change discussions in the forest sector all the attention has been on reforestation and afforestation
1316262 at the bali climate change conference in december everybody kind of woke up and realised that natural forests store a vast amount of carbon and that we cant afford to allow further emissions from deforestation and forest degeneration because these are on top of fossil fuel burning

1316273 he left me about a mile behind and directed several of his basketball workouts from the sideline while assistant coach maurice lucas took part in drills and in defending oden
1316274 luke wasnt moving fast enough so i jumped in there mcmillan said
1316275 so i start hitting oden but then he hits me back and you know how when you hit something and everything inside of you is shaking well thats what is happening here i hit him and then he hits me and everything is shaking
1316276 but he was like let me show you how to do it you are not doing it right and i was like coach let me do it
1316277 i yell and hit the floor and i couldnt get up
1316278 i couldnt move for 20 minutes i couldnt get up mcmillan said
1316279 so they had to lift me up like a board and stand me up then i had to go from that position to trying to get in a car then i was wondering how i was going to fly back
1316280 ill shoot and i will do some drills but i wont play anymore even if i get my back right i wont play again not with him hes a big guy man a big guy
1316281 yeah i can see it and i think he will be special mcmillan said
1316282 and i want to help him understand what it takes
1316283 when i worked out with him i hit hit and he hits right back
1316284 i like that most guys you hit them and the next time they are kind of protecting themselves you hit him and the next time he runs right over you
1316285 he was trying to make a point by saying these are how the other guys are going to come at you
1316286 coach is trying to make me better so you know what if he is going to sit there and push on me im not going to sit there and practice being soft im going to come back just as hard as i would in a real game
1316287 hes going to have to be embarrassed and fall and once that happens and he responds thats when you will see the greg oden that everybody thinks he can become mcmillan said
1316288 but he is going to have to be busted in the mouth and embarrassed and that could take a month it could take a year it could take a game

1316297 informal communication is routine in labour talks and in fact occurred in other guilds negotiations this year
1316298 sags negotiators have not discussed with us any plan to reach an agreement and the only meeting the parties are attempting to schedule is one to resolve some outstanding grievance claims
1316299 no meetings formal or informal regarding these negotiations have taken place since the sidebar sag requested on july 16 and no meetings are pending
1316300 you will no doubt read spin suggesting that there is dead silence between our sides
1316301 discussions through alternative channels are ongoing as we work toward a fair deal for actors as soon as possible
1316302 the amptp is always interested in exploring new ways to reach an agreement and if sag has an approach thats consistent with the parameters of our june 30 final offer then we are open to hearing that
1316303 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues

1316306 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1316307 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1316308 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1316309 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1316310 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy

1316319 if we can get him some playing time at some time during the season thats what we need to be looking at
1316320 i think that should happen i want to see him play some quarterback this year then weve got two years with him and some continuity anything more than that would be a bonus
1316321 but its not the internal pain im definitely making progress coach kelly and them are doing a good job spoon feeding it to me so that i wont go into information overload so that what hes teaching is being effective
1316322 hes a little better but not to the level we want him to be its a work in progress
1316323 some people come back from surgery to their arm really well others take longer this ones taking a little longer thats not to say that hes not tough enough or that hes a baby its just that its physically hard for him right now hes not there yet

1316326 but its not the internal pain im definitely making progress coach kelly and them are doing a good job spoon feeding it to me so that i wont go into information overload so that what hes teaching is being effective
1316327 to be honest i think it was hotter last year
1316328 but our guys have handled it well they came into camp in better condition and that has helped us with the heat
1316329 hes a good player he is a piece to our offense in terms of what we do we can do a lot of multiple looks with him its a lot of two back stuff but heck its all about scoring points i dont care what it looks like he can help us on offense hes 265 pounds and a 400 pound bench hes as strong as anybody hes going to play on sunday somebody is going to have him on their football team in the nfl
1316330 hes got a jason giambi mustache other than that hes one of the best kids weve got
1316331 that incomplete should have been completed before we got to camp

1316334 it is a fundamental truth that unless india achieves major improvements in health nutrition water and sanitation education gender equality and child protection global efforts to reach the mdgs will fail
1316335 global achievement of the health related mdgs depends largely on indias success and on china accelerating progress even further
1316336 but gains have been overshadowed by deepening disparities which means that health care often fails to reach the poorest
1316337 the divide between rich and poor is rising at a troubling rate within sub regions of asia pacific leaving vast numbers of mothers and children at risk of increasing relative poverty and continued exclusion from quality primary health care services
1316338 in india one out of every three women is underweight putting them at risk of having low birth weight babies and these babies are 20 times more likely to die in infancy than healthy babies

1316356 esperamos que esto hecho abra nuevas reas de investigaci n para el tratamiento de la enfermedad basados en el proceso de la fusi n por si mismo
1316357 hasta la fecha la teor a de la fusi n y todas las evidencias que la sustentan han sido pasadas por alto en gran parte de la comunidad de investigaci n de c ncer
1316358 nuestra principal motivaci n al publicar este art culo es animar a otros laboratorios a que se unan a investigar en este tema

1316366 when a major retail chain remodels or relocates a store they are working to give their customer base the nicest environment possible but on the flip side much of the used equipment would end up in a landfill
1316367 it brings a great return to the retailer on their used equipment and more importantly ensures the majority of replaced equipment is recycled and distributed to other segments of the market
1316368 we have been refining this process for over 30 years and we now have a sales staff finding the best fit for each type of equipment within 20 to 30 days of beginning work on a store we have the equipment sold and shipped to new owners most of the buyers are smaller retailers who are happy to find an entry level price on otherwise expensive equipment

1316376 for the swiss cabinet at the time technocratic reasons swung the balance they didnt want to give up their diplomatic representation on the chinese mainland but standing by chiang kai shek would have meant moving to taiwan
1316377 switzerland was very valuable for beijing because it was one of the very few european countries with chinese diplomatic representation
1316378 as a small country switzerland didnt raise any suspicions among the chinese of pursuing any hidden agendas
1316379 when it comes to dealing with minorities the swiss talk to the chinese confidently and as equals
1316380 our perception of the human rights situation in china is based on a lack of information on chinas position in the global human rights debate
1316381 in 1986 146 united nations countries agreed with this against a no from the united states and eight abstentions from european countries
1316382 when china talks about improving human rights in connection with the olympic games this is what it has in mind because the new buildings and infrastructure will result in development this is not a particularly typical chinese point of view its that of the un
1316383 the swiss press boycott events right under their nose the un human rights body has always had its headquarters in geneva

1316391 esta investigaci n examina la conversi n de tierra para biocombustibles y hacemos la siguiente pregunta esto lo vale
1316392 el carbono que pierdes al convertir bosques campos de hierbas y turberas sobrepasa al carbono que tu ahorras al usar biocombustibles en lugar de combustibles f siles y sorprendentemente la respuesta es no
1316393 producir biocombustibles basados en alimentos requerir que a n m s tierra sea convertida para la agricultura
1316394 los biocombustibles producidos en cultivos perennes recolectados en tierras degradadas que ya no es til para los crecientes cultivos de alimentos podr a realmente ayudarnos a combatir el calentamiento global
1316395 un ejemplo es el etanol producido de mezclas diversas de plantas nativas de las praderas

1316410 community recreation and parks is the health provider that you dont know about
1316411 traditionally these agencies are considered as organizers of games and sports in a towns parks or ball fields but our study shows that 9 out of 10 recreation and park professionals are actively involved in a health partnership sometimes several of them
1316412 twenty years ago health care providers didnt consider recreation and park professionals to be a partner in the campaigns to promote health
1316413 but in the 1990s community based health partnerships were starting to consider the role of recreation and parks in promoting physical activity and quality of life since many related programs are offered by recreation and park managers
1316414 health campaigns naturally involve recreation and park departments because they provide low cost close to home opportunities for physical activity such as trails recreation centers outdoor courts and outdoor swimming facilities
1316415 one of the main reasons for the trend is financial difficulties arising from credit card spending overdrafts and other debts resulting in people taking insolvency advice comparisons with the early 90s are ill founded people are taking a view that they may as well going into less expensive rented accommodation than spend all of their income on mortgages and secured loans that will take a lifetime to pay off
1316416 people realise the repossession process will affect their credit rating but they are not too worried about that as most have serious debt problems anyway
1316417 the whole process of repossession turns secured debts into unsecured ones if advice is taken early by taking out an iva or going bankruptcy then losses can be mitigated the worst thing to do is bury your head in the sand the debts wont go way unless you deal with them
1316418 i am pleased with the continued effort that our employees have demonstrated over the past six months despite very difficult market conditions the new issue market during the second quarter was among the worst i have ever witnessed
1316419 though the lack of new issue activity continues to impact our overall results cowen performed well in areas not constrained by current market conditions including our brokerage and strategic advisory areas

1316430 as previously announced sirit continued to experience delays in toll transponder orders from our largest toll customer however expenses in the second quarter remained consistent with the first quarter even with the acquisition of rsi
1316431 in light of the continued slower revenue generation sirit has already implemented actions to reduce operating expenses for the second half of 2008
1316432 even with the delays experienced in our traditional tolling market we are excited about the very large opportunities sirit is pursuing as an example we have been working very closely with 3m on new toll and electronic vehicle registration opportunities worldwide as we recently announced with the deployment of our toll technology with 3m in brazil we have also recognized the need to more closely align our spending with revenue levels and have taken actions to control expenses until revenue growth returns
1316433 overall i continue to be confident about the future for sirit and i look forward to high growth and achieving profitability in 2009 as we expect to see new application areas become a reality for sirit

1316444 developing an accurate model of ice would help architects civil engineers and environmental engineers understand what happens to structures and systems exposed to freezing conditions
1316445 it could also help us understand and better predict the movement of glaciers
1316446 but they just stop where they happen to lie in different configurations throughout the crystal with no correlation between them and no single one lowers the energy enough to take over and reduce the entropy to zero
1316447 the original spin ice research went from one part of the periodic table to a more flexible one
1316448 but artificial spin ice goes off the periodic table altogether
1316449 it mimics the behavior of real ice but is completely designable with specific properties
1316450 we can change the strength of the spin or reformulate the alloy to change the magnetic properties which creates new bulk properties that we either couldnt get from normal materials or couldnt control at the atomic level
1316451 this is the first time the rules of ice behavior have ever been rigorously confirmed by directly counting pseudo hydrogen atoms
1316452 we can track the position and movement of each pseudo atom in our model see where defects occur in the lattice and simulate what happens over much longer periods of time
1316453 our meta material is very similar to patterned hard disk media
1316454 weve found that both hydrogen in ice and the pseudo hydrogen in our artificial spin ice also behave as bits can carry information and interact with each other perhaps in the future engineers will be inspired by this in their hard drive designs the formal patterning and bit interactions may actually help to stabilize information ultimately leading to drives with much higher capacities

1316470 we have been requesting india to sign the nuclear non proliferation treaty and ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty this position has not changed
1316471 in a manner that will not hamper but will strengthen international disarmament and non proliferation regime
1316472 we would like to have access to technologies that have been denied to us for many years
1316473 we are fully aware of japans sensitivity on this issue
1316474 total nuclear disarmament and strict adherence to non proliferation commitment as enshrined in various international treaties

1316488 in indian society where girls of such an age of three years are treated as goddesses occurrences as in the present case are very unfortunate and inhuman at the hands of the lusty people
1316489 in the instant case the convict has raped a young female child who is unable to express herself to outsiders except her mother

1316520 in the complex and fast paced world of medicine where patient safety is a primary concern physicians need to be assured that they are using agents and the best possible safety profile this is particularly important with agents that affect heart rhythm and may predispose patients to life threatening arrhythmias that can occur without warning
1316521 many urologists and other physicians who treat bph dont often have access to ecg to monitor the cardiac safety of the agents they prescribe
1316522 therefore its important that physicians recognize which agents affect the qtc interval and to avoid those agents if an alternative is available

1316629 the name that can be named is not the real name
1316630 from the island of my personal reality i can look out on the panoramic interconnectedness of nature our lives part of a larger process vital links in our planetary ecosystem and human evolution i watch us take our place i recognize that my life is peripheral yet integral to a much reality like m c eschers drawing of two hands drawing each other i am part of the world trying to figure itself out as i accept the existential fact that we all live in different realities i become one with everyone who lives a similar fate i am no longer alone in my aloneness i am one with existence expressed through my own existence

1316632 reclaiming ourselves usually means coming to recognize and accept that we have in us both sides of everything
1316633 sometimes our vulnerability is our strength our fear develops our courage and our woundedness is the road to our integrity

1316730 the conclusions reached from this study are another validation of the ability of the pharmanex biophotonic scanner to accurately depict an individuals overall antioxidant defense system
1316731 hplc is the gold standard of carotenoid measurement yet weve effectively shown that a non invasive two minute measurement with the pharmanex biophotonic scanner is just as accurate
1316732 the biophotonic scanner is an innovative business tool our distributors can use to definitively demonstrate that pharmanex nutritional products make a difference for their customers carotenoid status and potentially their overall antioxidant health
1316733 in wholesale madden girl and daniel m friedman were bright spots as we generated strong sales increases in these two divisions in the second quarter we also remain pleased with our wholesale gross margin which rose modestly and reflects positive trends in both footwear and accessories while we continue to experience the effects of the challenging macroeconomic environment we are beginning to see some renewed momentum in our business we are experiencing a positive response to our merchandise from both our wholesale customers and consumers and we are encouraged by emerging footwear trends and the current sell through of our product
1316734 we are pleased with our ability to maintain a strong financial position despite the challenging macroeconomic environment our balance sheet continues to demonstrate the companys strength as we ended the quarter with 46 3 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities no debt and total stockholders equity of 184 0 million we remain confident the company is well positioned for long term growth
1316735 while we are maintaining a conservative approach to managing our business this year due to the challenging retail environment we are encouraged by our recent performance and believe we are well positioned as we move into the latter half of fiscal 2008 the company has a solid foundation for long term success based on the increasing diversification of our business the strength of our design team and our strong focus on execution
1316736 the key to living happily is talking openly and feeling in control family and friends mean well but its a relief to talk to someone like myself who understands the challenges
1316737 as we previously announced our second quarter results were below our expectations due to challenges primarily in the areas of revenue per day and vehicle depreciation costs
1316738 in this tough economic environment we continue to concentrate on the items in our business that we control such as maximizing revenue per day vehicle utilization cost reduction and service delivery
1316739 our focus in todays environment is on executing every day in every market with every customer
1316740 company is pleased to announce that it has now closed on an agreement whereby the company will purchase 100 of an independent bc company that holds the tailings management facility that is located within the companys copper mountain project area for cash payments totaling 5 200 000
1316741 this acquisition of securing the tailings management facility area is another significant step forward to secure the future of this mine for many years although our letter of intent provided a high confidence level it is nice to be able to finalize this purchase as it is one of the last critical items necessary to meet our target production start up at the end of 2010
1316742 we are pleased with the operating results of our fiscal 2008 third quarter particularly in light of the uncertainties in both the general economy as well as the commercial airline industry
1316743 our organic sales growth of 12 and ebitda as defined margin of almost 47 continue to reflect the strength of our proprietary and sole source products as well as the diverse global commercial aerospace and military markets we serve the ongoing strong ebitda as defined margin was again achieved in spite of the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and boeing 787 development expenses
1316744 we continue to be optimistic about the fourth quarter and fiscal 2008 at this time we expect fiscal 2009 revenues to be above fiscal 2008 revenues however it appears increasingly possible that fiscal 2009 could see modest if any growth in worldwide air traffic demand for commercial oem aircraft production remains strong and we expect will continue to do so in 2009
1316745 our practice has been to reduce our cost structure ahead of softening market conditions this has proven to be an effective means of protecting long term shareholder value given this uncertain market outlook we have started to reduce our cost structure and expect to have made significant reductions by the end of the current fourth quarter to position ourselves for fiscal 2009 we will closely monitor our cost structure and make additional adjustments up or down as we move forward into fiscal 2009
1316746 together with espn we are thrilled to give nascar fans the chance to watch all the excitement of the racetrack live on their mobile phones
1316747 this has been a very active and eventful quarter for the company
1316748 obviously we are very disappointed in the fdas decision to issue an approvable letter for nebido r
1316749 our portfolio of marketed products continues to perform well we have seen an impressive move upward in vantas r as units shipped increased 29 0 versus the third quarter of 2007
1316750 we and our partner allergan are very pleased with the launch of sanctura xr tm in the overactive bladder market
1316751 we have also been very busy with business development activities completing two international licensing agreements during the quarter
1316752 in april we announced the signing of a license agreement with orion corporation granting orion the rights to market vantas throughout europe as well as certain other countries
1316753 finally we recently announced a corporate restructuring to better align our expense structure with the realities of the nebido delay
1316754 our new operating plan provides for the aggressive support and top line growth of our marketed products vantas and supprelin la aggressive support for the launch of valstar tm continued co promotion with allergan of sanctura r and sanctura xr through march 2009 initiation of phase iii trials for the octreotide implant for acromegaly and a significant reduction in operating expenses including an approximately 12 reduction in company wide headcount
1316755 we have made the difficult but necessary decision to reduce the operating expenses and cash burn of the company and intend to be vigilant in managing expenses through this difficult period we are also moving forward to strengthen our balance sheet in addition to potential out licensing transactions for our partnerable products we are also exploring opportunities for the monetization of the royalties we receive from sales of sanctura and sanctura xr our financial goals are to secure adequate non dilutive capital to fund the companys operations for the foreseeable future and to manage the companys outstanding convertible debt which matures in july 2009
1316756 adms 2008 results demonstrate the ability of our people to leverage our global assets against an exceptional set of opportunities
1316757 we had an outstanding year highlighted by record segment operating profit adm met the needs of food feed fuel and industrial customers even as strong demand for crops and commodities challenged the global supply chain
1316758 weve worked extensively to bring the most stunning resort property to santa fe and create a las vegas style gaming experience in northern new mexico
1316759 were thrilled to welcome our first guests and look forward to creating a spectacular grand opening in early september
1316760 a number of factors contributed to these results including the strength of our oil and gas power generation and mining markets our growing international presence and acquisitions we completed in the past year our earnings per share also reflect the impact of the share repurchase program we implemented earlier in the year our performance in the first half of 2008 puts us on very sound footing as we enter the second half of the year which is especially important in light of seasonal decreases in activity that are typical of the second half and current concerns about the economic outlook
1316761 many of our u s and european markets face uncertain economic conditions brought on by high energy prices and other well publicized factors
1316762 we expect these developments combined with normal seasonal reductions in activity to slow our rate of growth in the second half of the year in comparison to the first half however we expect our operating performance to continue to improve and our operating results to exceed those we reported in the second half of 2007
1316763 das libanesische volk seine armee und sein widerstand haben das recht unter der autorit t des staates von israel besetztes land zu befreien
1316764 we will continue to implement our strategy to invest about 6 4 billion in michigan over the next five years including investments in energy efficiency renewable energy environmental and customer service enhancements and new power generation
1316765 we expect these investments to create thousands of jobs in michigan and to provide a boost to the states economy as well as supporting our ongoing efforts to provide reliable affordable service to our customers
1316766 this legislative package would support the major investments needed in michigan to keep power prices affordable and help ensure reliable energy supplies for customers in the future
1316767 we recognize that when people purchase a book they do not purchase it because a specific named publisher publishes it they purchase it because it fulfills a need and is well designed and edited as you can see by the wording of our awards it is open to all
1316768 we are pleased to have reached this important milestone our preliminary data confirms the safety and efficacy of our lead product ibi 20089 as well as the versatility and flexibility of our underlying verisome tm drug delivery technology
1316769 we believe ibi is creating the future standard of ophthalmic care as evidenced by the development of ibi 20089 the first of many products already in development based on the verisome tm technology

1316774 the development of the cdma wireless industry in china is providing a great deal of growth opportunities to local companies and operators
1316775 this license agreement with huaqin a chinese company founded in june 2005 and dedicated to research and development of telecom products will enable them to introduce advanced 3g cdma2000 products into the growing cdma market in china thereby fulfilling huaqins goal of offering the most efficient high quality phones to their customers

1316777 the license from qualcomm a company known for its continuous innovation and support for the wireless industry will allow us to offer our customers devices with increased capabilities and high data rates while bringing down consumer prices
1316778 during the first half of 2008 the advancement of rigels clinical development programs took center stage
1316779 most significantly we initiated two important phase 2b clinical trials of r788 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and reported favorable results from a phase 2 clinical trial of r788 in b cell lymphoma patients
1316780 overall we are pleased with our progress this quarter the mines have performed well despite some headwinds from bad weather raw material cost inflation and the increasingly competitive market for skilled labor we have also completed the acquisition of reserves and permits from cheyenne resources we began mining on the acquired properties in july most importantly the market has finally begun to turn in a positive direction the single biggest issue that we have faced during the past several years has been pressure on profit margins this pressure has been due to extremely low coal prices and rapidly rising costs particularly in underground mining due to changes in the safety and regulatory environment during the past several months tight markets around the world have led to rising prices in the u s market while we have seen very little benefit from these prices thus far in 2008 due to lower priced contracts that were signed in 2006 and 2007 we believe that our shareholders will begin to see the benefits during the remaining months of 2008 and a much greater benefit beginning in early 2009
1316781 under very difficult circumstances the mines performed relatively well this quarter our operations in capp continue to be impacted by challenges in three areas 1 the new regulatory environment 2 a tight labor market and 3 raw material inflation our mine operations team has been working diligently to address the effect of these issues our operations in the illinois basin continued to be impacted by bad weather while the number of storms passing through the midwest went down from the first quarter the severity of the storms in the second quarter had a much broader effect on the mines the transportation infrastructure and the utility plants things have improved dramatically so far in the third quarter
1316782 we have made a great deal of progress in the sales and contracting area during the past several months our objective has been to reach a balance between locking in cash margins for our shareholders and maintaining leverage to the tightening coal markets we believe that we have achieved this balance we will continue to monitor market developments and layer in additional new contracts in the future
1316783 we are pleased with our second quarter results particularly the 23 3 percent increase in our pro forma net income the solid bottom line performance reflects strong volume growth and continued improvements in key areas of our business while the mlr in our rapidly expanding medicare advantage business rose more than expected it was offset by further strengthening in our commercial business a stable reform segment and ongoing enhancement of our operating ratio reflecting both our growth and inherent corporate leverage
1316784 we continue to execute on our focused business strategy and we remain convinced that we can profitably capture additional market share for several years
1316785 as we enter the second half of the year we remain well positioned to achieve our prior 2008 eps guidance our revenue performance has exceeded our expectations and the steady improvement in our commercial business has helped us weather the uptick in the medicare advantage mlr which we believe has peaked and should trend lower in the final six months of the year
1316786 i am pleased to see the progress bellus health is making in both its nutraceutical and pharmaceutical programs
1316787 ovos natural health our nutraceutical subsidiary is on track to launch vivimind tm in canada and on the internet during the third quarter of 2008 the launch will be supported by synergistic advertising and public relations campaigns targeting major broadcast print and web electronic media with respect to our pharmaceutical activities we are proceeding as planned for our second phase iii clinical trial with kiacta tm and our phase ii clinical trial with nc 503 for the treatment of type ii diabetes and certain features of metabolic syndrome bellus health has succeeded in the past six months establishing advanced and strong programs for its commercial development and research activities and has significantly reduced its burn rate building on these accomplishments the company is entering a new and exciting phase in its development which will also include for the management to secure a solid financial base

1316796 despite this difficult environment with our focus on executing our plans we are positioned for continued success
1316797 people have a hard time adhering to diets and our research shows that choosing eggs for breakfast can dramatically improve the success of a weight loss plan
1316798 apparently the increased satiety and energy due to eggs helps people better comply with a reduced calorie diet
1316799 eggs are a good source of all natural high quality protein so they can help keep you satisfied longer making it easier to resist tempting snacks
1316800 nearly half of an eggs protein and many of the other nutrients are found in the yolk so make sure to eat the whole egg for maximum benefits

1316820 a real sense of urgency is a highly positive and highly focused force because it naturally directs you to truly alert to whats really happening it rarely leads to a race to deal with the trivial to pursue pet projects of minor significance to the larger organization or to tackle important issues in uninformed potentially dangerous ways
1316821 when you are going from one meeting to the next all on different topics all run inefficiently attitudes and feelings about urgency drain out through sheer exhaustion clutter undermines true urgency fatigue undermines true urgency

1316828 the best i can explain my approach is that i try to give some context to what were reading it works well for my daughter who wants to know what the big picture is before i try to teach any details
1316829 we worked through the books of moses that way too exodus as straightforward narrative leviticus with a theme of holiness and divided into sections as given in
1316830 and i still remember that feeling of suspense at the end of deuteronomy when we felt like we were waiting with the israelites to go across the river we ended up starting the book of joshua the same year because my daughter couldnt stand to wait for the fall to see how it all turned out i would never have thought myself that a second grader would get that interested in the old testament arent those the books where all the going to read the bible this year good intentioned people drop out but she did and we kept reading

1316835 i would suggest that a minority of people had hidden them with the intention of causing harm to police officers and possibly to the horses or dogs we are using on patrol
1316836 to link a stash of knives allegedly found somewhere in the hoo peninsula in kent to the camp for climate action is nothing but a smear campaign against us
1316837 to suggest that the campers environmentalists living at a camp serving only vegan food would even consider hurting a police horse shows the polices press release to be nothing but political policing
1316838 this in no way justifies the way the police are treating the camp
1316839 it is disgraceful to suggest that the campers have criminal intent
1316840 this is obviously an attempt by the police to distract us from raising issues about climate change
1316841 angola can be an example to the african continent and to the world in general on how to hold democratic free and transparent elections
1316842 what is happening in south east asia is terrifying to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1316843 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1316844 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1316845 the pressures on them have increased with the big push towards growing monoculture crops in part for their use as biofuels the growing of palm oil crops in south east asia and soya beans in the amazon have taken their toll
1316846 but hunting of primates for bushmeat has also increased this was a subsistence issue but now its almost become a luxury food with a higher price than for chicken or fish both in african and in south east asia
1316847 if you look at history you will see that as a result of the people moving away from the party of government regimes like the nazis have come into power
1316848 i dont want to think that the speaker disclosed them on purpose and i dont have any intention of comparing the democrats to the nazis
1316849 he was saying that the fact that debate has not been progressing in parliament is a serious problem and that the nazi regime arose from a similar situation

1316860 the constitutional crisis in zimbabwe continues as president mugabe persists in his ambition to steal the election
1316861 president mugabe and his zanu pf party have unleashed a campaign of violence against those ordinary zimbabweans 60 percent of them who in spite of everything voted against him
1316862 this only serves to fuel suspicion that president mugabe is seeking to reverse the results that have been published if that is the case then what we are witnessing is a charade of democracy

1316897 victims need a lot of support and now work can be done to make victims self reliant not let them be like beggars on the street
1316898 i hope that cluster munitions will never again be used by any states
1316899 this becomes easier as well if we do not make a binary of the sacred secular divide
1316900 si la naturaleza humana fue creada en el estado de santidad y de justicia y de la misma manera el ngel ca do criatura de dios tres veces santo el mal no exist a en ella c mo entonces una naturaleza santa pura y justa fue capaz de pervertirse por el pecado original no teniendo en s misma un principio de mal y si fue ella misma la que cre ese principio nefasto c mo habr sido santa justa y correcta en su origen una vez que la santidad no admite el mal

1316911 ni el ojo vio ni el o do oy ni vino a la mente del hombre lo que dios ha preparado para los que le aman
1316912 el que reclama para s mismo lo que t ofreces a todos queriendo como cosa particular lo que est destinado a todos es reducido desde lo que era com n a lo que es suyo propio esto es cae de la verdad en la mentira
1316913 siendo de condici n divina no tuvo por tesoro codiciable mantenerse igual a dios antes se anonad tomando la forma de siervo y haci ndose semejante a los hombres
1316914 cristo es el primero y principal doctor de la ense anza espiritual y de la fe seg n aquello hebr
1316915 la potestad docente de jes s se considera ya en atenci n a los milagros por los cuales confirmaba su doctrina ya en orden a su eficacia persuasiva ya en cuanto a la autoridad de su palabra porque hablaba como teniendo dominio sobre la ley cuando dec a pero yo os digo mt 5 34 y por ltimo en relaci n a su rectitud moral que mostraba en su trato viviendo sin pecado
1316916 luego es evidente que bajo todos los conceptos la ciencia sagrada es m s noble que las dem s
1316917 el que tenga o dos para o r que oiga
1316918 mezcla lo claro y lo oscuro para que por medio de lo entendido alcancen lo que no entienden

1316920 este dato no es necesario acomodarlo al significado de la par bola porque seg n mi teor a no es parte de ella sino ornato
1316921 no al mercader sino a la perla es semejante el reino de los cielos como en la precedente par bola no es semejante al hombre que halla el tesoro sino al tesoro en cuesti n
1316922 tiene la misma significaci n que la precedente s lo var a en la materia
1316923 la palabra de dios no solamente reporta una gran ganancia como tesoro sino que tambi n es preciosa como una perla
1316924 la verdad es una y no est dividida y por eso habla de una sola perla encontrada y as como el que posee la perla comprende que es rico mientras que los otros no se dan cuenta porque tiene la perla que es peque a escondida en la mano as sucede en la predicaci n del evangelio los que la poseen saben que son ricos pero los infieles que no poseen este tesoro ignoran nuestras riquezas
1316925 o de otra manera se compara la iglesia santa a una red porque ha sido entregada a unos pescadores y todos mediante ella son arrastrados de las olas de la vida presente al reino eterno a fin de que no perezcan sumergidos en el abismo de la muerte eterna
1316926 esta iglesia re ne a toda clase de peces porque llama para perdonarlos a todos los hombres a los sabios y a los insensatos a los libres y a los esclavos a los ricos y a los pobres a los fuertes y a los d biles estar completamente llena la red esto es la iglesia cuando al fin de los tiempos est terminado el destino del g nero humano por eso sigue la cual cuando est llena etc porque as como el mar representa al mundo as tambi n la ribera del mar figura la terminaci n del mundo y en esta terminaci n es cuando son escogidos y guardados en vasijas los buenos y los malos son arrojados fuera es decir los elegidos ser n recibidos en los tabern culos eternos y los malos despu s de haber perdido la luz que iluminaba el interior del reino ser n llevados a las tinieblas exteriores porque ahora contiene la red de la fe igualmente como a mezclados peces a todos los malos y buenos pero luego en la ribera se ver los que estaban dentro de la red de la iglesia
1316927 porque de la misma manera que el padre de familia debe alimentar a los suyos con el mantenimiento corporal as el doctor evang lico debe sustentar al pueblo cristiano con el sustento espiritual
1316928 ninety percent of over 6 trillion business e mails this year will be spam
1316929 the impact of backscatter is especially hard on businesses with fewer it resources or appliances that just can

1316932 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1316933 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction

1316977 the pikoli decision was implemented but terminated when the case was struck from the roll by judge herbert msimang so that decision is no longer open to review
1316978 the present decision to charge zuma by acting npa head mokotedi mpshe is therefore a fresh decision and is not a review of the pikoli decision

1316992 hai anak adam sesungguhnya kami telah menurunkan kepadamu pakaian untuk menutup auratmu dan pakaian indah untuk indah untuk perhiasan dan pakaian taqwa itulah yang paling baik yang demikian itu adalah sebagian dari tanda tanda kekuasaan allah mudah mudahan mereka selalu ingat
1316993 wahai nabi katakanlah kepada istri istri anak anak perempuan dan istri istri orang mukmin hendaklah mereka mengulurkan jilbabnya ke seluruh tubuh mereka yang demikian itu supaya mereka mudah dikenali oleh sebab itu mereka tidak diganggu dan allah adalah maha pengampun lagi maha penyayang
1316994 dan hendaklah engkau tetap di rumahmu dan janganlah berhias serta bertingkah laku seperti orang orang jahiliyah dulu
1316995 hendaklah mereka menahan pandangannya dan kemaluannya dan janganlah mereka menampakkan perhiasannya kecuali yang biasa nampak dari padanya dan hendaklah mereka menutupkan kain kudung ke dadanya dan janganlah menampakkan perhiasannya kecuali kepada suami mereka atau ayah mereka atau ayah suami mereka atau putera putera mereka atau putera putera suami mereka atau saudara saudara laki laki mereka atau putera putera saudara lelaki mereka atau putera putera saudara perempuan mereka atau wanita wanita islam atau budak budak yang mereka miliki atau pelayan pelayan laki laki yang tidak mempunyai keinginan terhadap wanita atau anak anak yang belum mengerti tentang aurat wanita dan janganlah mereka memukulkan kakinya agar diketahui perhiasan yang mereka sembunyikan dan bertaubatlah kamu sekalian kepada allah hai orang orang yang beriman supaya kamu beruntung

1317000 i can confirm that the portuguese police put it to gerry as a fact that madeleines dna had been found in the apartment and the vehicle when it is now clear that that was not the case and that the initial fss report had said the findings were inconclusive
1317001 you have to ask what the police were trying to achieve by over presenting evidence that they did not have and clearly could not claim to have
1317002 kate and gerrys lawyers are continuing to examine all of the information in minute detail and where anything that is relevant to finding madeleine needs to be done it will be

1317006 when he returned from america after medical treatment he was asked as to his health and condition so the shaykh said some words worthy of being written in gold
1317007 know that both illness and good health do not come before or after their decreed time indeed my time has been written and your time has been written even before allaah created the heavens and the earth so believe in this for certainly i have believed in this
1317008 whoever says l il he illallah muhammedun rasulallah will enter jennet
1317009 i have been ordered to fight with people as long until they say l il he illallah muhammedun rasulallah
1317010 for we assuredly sent amongst every people a messenger with the command serve allah and eschew evil of the people were some whom allah guided and some on whom error became inevitably established so travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who denied the truth
1317011 say if it be that your fathers your sons your brothers your mates or your kindred the wealth that ye have gained the commerce in which ye fear a decline or the dwellings in which ye delight are dearer to you than allah of his mesenger or the striving in his cause then wait until allah brings about his decision and allah guides not the rebellious
1317012 when allah alone is mentioned the hearts of those who believe not in the hereafter are filled with disgust but when other than he are mentioned behold they are filled with joy
1317013 and we put coverings over their hearts and minds lest they should understand the quran and deafness into their ears when thou dost mention thy rabb and him alone in the quran they turn on their backs fleeing from the truth
1317014 i have created jinns and mankind only to worship me i swear that i have sent a prophet to every umma to notify them to worship allah and to leave the idols
1317015 your rabb has concluded that you should not worship anybody else but allah do worship allah dont put any partner to his side come and let me tell you what allah has proclaimed as haram for you namely to put a partner to his side
1317016 the ones who have faith and who do not let their faith come together with injustice are the ones who have for sure justice with themselves they are people who have found the right way
1317017 whoever witnesses that there is nothing but allah that muhammed sav is his prophet that allah is the rabb of meryem and isa as and that jennet and jehennem are real are the ones whom allah will put into jennet
1317018 he is the creator of the skies and of the earth when he has decided something to be he just says be and it will be he is one only ilah god he is exalted and there is no other ilah he is alive he is present with his personality and his perfection he is far from what people talk about him eyes cannot reach him
1317019 with this inspiration the truth has come and the false has disappeared for sure the false always will disappear now it is very clear what is qufr and what is faith
1317020 do they then seek after a judgment of the days of ignorance but who for a people whose faith is assured can give better judgement than allah
1317021 and your ilah is vahid he is the one and only ilah there is no ilah but him he is rahman he is rahim
1317022 allah there is no ilah but he he is hayy the living and he is kayyum the self subsisting the supporter of all

1317029 every twenty minutes you should be drinking some type of fluid
1317030 if you are exercising for sixty minutes or more think about a sports drink an electrolyte carbohydrate solution that is going to replace salt and carbohydrates
1317031 if you drink a lot of water without replacing salt you could develop hyponatrymia it is the combination of losing salt in our sweat and in addition not replacing it by the liquids that we are drinking
1317032 there is no reason not to drink some people feel if they do drink they will have an upset stomach
1317033 union with christ is really the central truth of the whole doctrine of salvation not only in its application but also in its once for all accomplishment in the finished work of christ

1317057 understands the need to set aspirational goals and to make sure the conditions on the ground warrant whatever aspirational goal there is
1317058 the timetables that were being argued in the congress were being argued based upon politics not based upon conditions on the ground

1317095 the most important thing i do i think is to try to relate my understanding of the life and work of jesus christ to individual persons it isnt a matter of trying to rescue myself or other people from a burning fire its a matter of trying to release me and other people to be what we were really intended to be eyres response to this reply is to point out that he does not speak of releasing but of trying to release he does not speak of relating the life and work of jesus christ to individual persons but of relating my understanding of the life and work of jesus christ the text continues you need to undestand he the minister points out with no attempt to overwhelm truss up or save that your mind is limited your understanding is limited your heritage is narrow there is truth a lot bigger than you know and understand and you have to leave that edge open when eyre reflects that the religion of his childhood was a methodism of dissent it made me realise that a key problem i have with christianisty today albeit not necessarily a characteristic of christ is the us and them mentality fostered by the very nature of religion of believing that your version of the truth is superior to another while i was growing up secularism was a bad thing and we were taught to support fellow brothers and sisters in christ suffering around the world but what about all the non christains suffering why prioritise the rights of people who happen to agree with you in a recent discussion with a thoughtful christain he made me reflect on how by virtue of finite resources we have to have a hierarchy of people to care for like how we naturally have a responsibility towards our family and friends before complete strangers further the following extract demonstrates that christianity need not be interpreted as removing oneself from the world the same minister is quoted by eyre as saying methodism consents it is part of our society the whole tone of dissent that was in the beginning is distant from most of us here eyre writes that if methodism tried as the fundamentalists do to draw its skirt aside to avoid contamination from society and the world it would discover like someone who starts pulling at the wrong bit of wool in an old jumper that it was unravelling the whole garment the purpose of this church is less to summon in the saved and pull up its drawbridge then to reach out beyond its apparent boundaries and try to meet outside society along a frayed edge of personal relationships and attempts to understand and help

1317100 the white house had concocted a fake letter from the director of the iraqi intelligence service to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1317101 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1317102 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1317103 they secretly resettled the intelligence official in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1317104 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1317105 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1317106 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1317107 we need to send a message to the next president that if he conducts himself in a similar capacity it would be met with a response from the congress that you are going to be held to account there is a point at which you reduce congress to a debating society

1317335 we are no longer a country for sale we have a sovereign and nationalist government
1317336 the assembly provides us with an opportunity to rethink ecuador to revise analyse and put forward a different path
1317337 we can be exporting as many flowers as we like or have a strong mining sector but still not be developed it is also more vital than ever that we recognise our interdependence with nature and other species as part of life which means protecting the wellbeing and perhaps rights of all living beings and the environment in which we live we need a vision of growing qualitatively not quantitively
1317338 our challenge is not to return to state industrialisation of the past or a washington consensus that failed we need a new paradigm of development that enshrines how to live sustainably without harming the environment
1317339 this is an issue that has to involve the whole world
1317340 kyoto is clearly not enough to tackle climate change we need to look for practices that go beyond mere market ones
1317341 development for us has always been about living how we always have lived we have always looked for other ways to measure life rather than economic factors we want to encourage people to think about different values not to be competitive and individualist but to learn how to care for mother earth live in community be embedded in family
1317342 we are ready to mobilise to make this recognition a reality
1317343 in the conflict between transnational mining companies and campesino farmer and indigenous communities we have clearly seen the limits of this government
1317344 if we continue treating nature as a dead entity new conflicts will arrive which will have an environmental focus but will be expressed in social confrontations we will also have lost the chance to design a new moment which reconciles 21st century socialism with the environment which promotes wellbeing above economic growth

1317353 the business environment during the second quarter deteriorated significantly in comparison to the same period last year
1317354 australian consumers would significantly benefit if woolworths faced more competitive threats that encouraged more aggressive pricing strategies
1317355 it wont publish the weekly specials it wont list grocery prices for individual supermarkets this is about giving consumers something new that the supermarket chains wont tell them who is cheapest in each region overall
1317356 woolworths is already working towards this with a trial in its baulkham hills store leading to a national rollout soon
1317357 retailers are well underway in rolling out unit pricing our main concern is that unit pricing does not become complex costly regulation with shoppers picking up the tab it should also be nationally consistent and apply to all retail outlets
1317358 the commission has found that the chains are growing by building new stores not by acquisitions there is no evidence to support more regulation
1317359 we would encourage all governments to commit to reform their outdated restrictive planning regulations and create more retail space which will help competition
1317360 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1317361 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1317362 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved
1317363 you want to be looking at the banks that have tended to do well against a u s slowdown or do well relative to other banks in asia when there is a slowdown within asia
1317364 against that backdrop the japanese banks have tended to do very poorly in terms of share performance relative to others in asia and we dont think it will be different this time around
1317365 in our view asset quality and credit cycle will be the biggest issue confronting asian banks in the second half of 2008 and 2009
1317366 growth is slowing input costs are rising borrowing costs are rising and currency moves are adverse which would mean margin compression
1317367 we will see more pricing materialise in the third and fourth quarters as we ship our winter season products like soup and non dairy creamer

1317377 rafael van der vaart es la primera incorporaci n de este a o y seguramente la nica consideramos que la plantilla es de mucha calidad de mucho talento un equipo que es una gran familia muy unida
1317378 rafael van der vaart s lo tiene 25 a os y desde los 17 juega en primera divisi n primero en el ajax y luego en el hamburgo ha ganado dos ligas una copa y una supercopa y es a decir de los t cnicos un jugador de extraordinaria calidad un medio que marca goles y que nos va a ayudar mucho esta temporada
1317379 dijimos que las incorporaciones ser an muy pocas y muy buenas era l gico despu s de estos dos a os de xitos en los que se han incorporado 19 jugadores j venes y comprometidos era una exigencia de esta junta directiva
1317380 aqu han jugado los mejores del mundo tu vas a ser uno de ellos ser una gran experiencia es un club exigente donde juega gente muy comprometida y entregada te deseo lo mejor y esperamos que te sientas como en casa
1317381 estoy muy contento de jugar en el mejor equipo del mundo es el sue o de mi familia y quiero ganar ya hala madrid

1317384 no creo que haya ning n problema el entrenador es el que decidir la posici n de cada uno en el campo guti es un fant stico jugador y es uno de los mejores de la plantilla
1317385 ha sido dif cil porque tiene una lesi n y l estaba apenado al mismo tiempo que yo estaba contento por venir al final la lesi n no ha sido para tanto y estamos todos muy contentos
1317386 la mejor posici n en la que creo que puedo dar m s de m es detr s de la delantera aunque tambi n por la izquierda o por la derecha hay varias opciones
1317387 espero que pueda marcar much simos goles para el liverpool y poder jugar junto a l en muchas ocasiones
1317388 el entendimiento entre nosotros y steven gerrard tambi n es importante l es el centrocampista que nos hace los pases tanto a m como a robbie con lo que cuanto m s podamos entrenar juntos m s cosas buenas lograremos para el liverpool
1317389 la idea es llegar en forma al comienzo de la temporada

1317448 when the drama first started there were really a lot of opinions and i was bothered about how to work on getting the audience to accept me in this role now that were nearing the end of the drama i just want to give my best right til the end
1317449 im not bothered about what has happened but more about why i cant seem to get it right i get afraid of new things sometimes and andy seems to be doing really well in his musical even though he just started doing it
1317450 when im back in seoul it gets even lonelier so even when its my day off i still stay in mungyeong when i used to live in yeoksam dong i could still visit the pc bang in my shorts and flipflops but since i moved to cheongdam dong which is near mnet too many fans are hanging around for me to get out of the house it feels even more like a prison now
1317451 during breaks in filming i just take off my coat and just walk about in flipflops in fact that feels even better and during these breaks i go fishing with the najang hyungs and its really fun to have all these fried fish
1317452 i think the fans are the ones who have really taken care of me for the duration for the filming for the drama the overseas fans prepared a buffet some weeks ago and yesterday we had lunchboxes delivered to us today weve received gifts too they even sent tonics and soups here although i havent really been looking after my health recently but im enjoying the tonics and soups from the fans
1317453 i hope this drama will leave good memories for the fans and the viewers

1317458 keep politics out of the olympics which was published in mypaper yesterday 5 august 2008 sports editor chia han keong made a plea that we be not distracted by politics and human rights issues when the beijing olympics begins this week
1317459 have you forgotten that the beijing olympics is actually about sporting excellence
1317460 meanwhile the elite olympic athletes train quietly devoid of distractions completely focused on golden aspirations
1317461 just like them lets not be distracted by politics and human rights issues it is absolutely not the right time to do so
1317462 so many sporting questions to be answered why bother about politics
1317463 its the end of the harmony of the olympic village and the end of the harmony of the games
1317464 politics is also any activity or manoeuvre aimed at achieving power or advantage over others within a particular group or organisation

1317484 the social and portable inbox optimizing e mail marketing in the new era of communication tools
1317485 consumers confidence in e mail has become shaken by irrelevant communications and high message frequency which are top drivers of subscribers churn and channel skepticism
1317486 people receive such a high volume of e mail that they are unable to pay attention to every message it is so important for marketers to be relevant and succinct when they send messages to consumers inboxes
1317487 google and other technology companies increasingly face mounting legal costs to defend against frivolous patent claims from parties gaming the system to forestall competition or reap windfall profits

1317489 what were talking about here is particularly good for brand advertisers
1317490 because we know every blog that exists and what their subject matter is we can go further down the tail
1317491 it all depends on the implementation how it fits into the content the layout and a given sites brand and market positioning
1317492 for blogs that rose as an alternative to traditional media it may be a problem because it creates a far more direct incentive to write about certain subjects for pay
1317493 if the bucks for tagging payoff is large enough some people naturally will change the way they write and what subjects they cover its just human nature
1317494 its a good entr e to invite people into the network
1317495 he opened the door a little and i was able to stick my nose in there and get past
1317496 his car was really fast and i was pretty fortunate to get around him
1317497 it was really great to win in front of the great race fans here in quebec it didnt work out for us last year but this time we were able to give them a win
1317498 i would have liked to have been able to get to ranger and challenge for the win but he wanted it really bad and was pretty smooth all day it turned out to be a good points day and well keep going from here
1317499 we came here with the goal of finishing on the podium and we were able to do that
1317500 those guys up front were really going at it i was hoping to possibly sneak in there if they got over aggressive but we just never got the opportunity were happy with the finish though this is such a great track to race and the all the fans make it fun

1317523 it seems that the market is losing interest in geopolitical and weather induced prop and instead is becoming more aware of growing supply demand imbalances
1317524 on the demand side energy participants are sensing that the global growth picture is deteriorating rapidl and is now no longer confined solely to the united states
1317525 given the current market conditions companies will not spend resources on respective firms product and services but rather companies will find ways of cutting costs in order to preserve their resources until economic conditions get better

1317527 weve had discussions with west virginias prosecutor and federal prosecutor
1317528 since mcclellan is from this area and most of the evidence is here were going to be dealing with this case
1317529 two people had reported what they believed was a decomposed body of an infant so we are investigating right now
1317530 we have not been able to substantiate any information at this point
1317531 anytime you have a change like this you have to be concerned and on alert to the opportunities and the threats
1317532 clearly the new buyer is going to want to pursue that long term lease if it can get a gift like that why not
1317533 i am pleased and excited for our employees and our customers to have reached this agreement with genesee amp wyoming
1317534 it was an important factor to be acquired by a company who embraces its employees and customers as we have over the last 22 years
1317535 it was equally important that the new owner also have the proven ability to invest the necessary capital for our systems continued growth
1317536 the grant money will provide programs and professional development opportunities to our region
1317537 we are deeply honored and this is extraordinarily well deserved
1317538 its important for all of our educators to be trained in the special needs of all of our students

1317544 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1317545 increases the likelihood that the eurozone economy contracted in the second quarter
1317546 consumers purchasing power is being squeezed markedly by elevated energy and food prices furthermore tight credit conditions higher interest rates and rising consumer concerns over both the economic outlook and their personal finances are all negatives for consumption
1317547 the latest index signalled a contraction of private sector output for the second month running
1317548 the rate of decline accelerating to the fastest since november 2001
1317549 the fall has left the annual rate at a record low of 3 1 percent clearly the slowdown underway in the eurozone economy is related to domestic spending and not just external demand
1317550 it looks as though consumer spending could have knocked around 0 3 percentage points off quarterly gdp growth with other components of growth also likely to have slowed there is a risk that gdp fell in the second quarter given that the surveys point to a fall in the third quarter too recession risks are mounting
1317551 forward looking indicators notably the accelerating rate of loss of new business and reduction in employment paint a bleak outlook for the rest of the quarter and raise the possibility that the eurozone will endure a technical recession
1317552 but with output price inflation picking up again it looks like the ecb will remain focused on upward inflation risks
1317553 the marked fall in retail sales in june and sharper contraction in service sector activity in july according to the purchasing managers survey add to the mounting evidence that the eurozone economic downturn is deepening
1317554 is for a significant slowdown but no recession or prolonged period of sluggish activity
1317555 a deceleration in the course of 2008 and a re acceleration toward trend during 2009

1317579 the cost of losing or compromising the integrity of pii is also leading to a renewed focus on information security
1317580 the survey shows that 81 percent of the 1 600 respondents who named information security management as a number 3 concern said that security risks are not fully known or are only partially assessed using technology
1317581 keeping on top of legislative and regulatory requirements is a critical responsibility made more difficult because compliance efforts are still operating in project mode and have not yet been embedded into business processes
1317582 it projects still lack alignment with business objectives at many organizations and as a result they are unable to realize business benefits
1317583 body fat composition is influenced by environmental factors such as diet and exercise but is also strongly controlled by genes
1317584 taking a long term perspective on ecosystem services highlights tradeoffs among services and points to the level at which management actions will be effective
1317585 its important to keep these tradeoffs in mind in order to develop realistic management goals
1317586 we often wring our hands trying to figure out how to put values on ecosystem services
1317587 we hope policy makers will take notice that there are costs associated with these economic activities that havent been accounted for previously
1317588 ecosystem services projects are far more likely to engage a wider variety of stakeholders drawing in private agricultural landowners and engaging funds from sources such as private corporations
1317589 this is what microfluidics does best it enables smaller yet more powerful systems to be developed systems that may have been laboratory based can become more portable or even hand held and at the same time can have increased accuracy and repeatability
1317590 the real challenge with this project was the fusing of such large etched glass plates
1317591 aligning the plates to ensure the etched microchannels were perfectly matched took a great deal of experience and put our capabilities to quite a test

1317598 adeccos stated strategy is to expand its professional operations in the us europe and asia as well as looking at specialized general staffing companies
1317599 adecco remains focussed on value based management and considers acquisition targets with financial discipline a further announcement will be made to the market if and when appropriate
1317600 i think adecco is keen to move up the value chain and michael page is a higher end company with higher average salaries earners
1317601 yeah just look around you 99 percent of the people here are total hipsters
1317602 these hipster zombies are the idols of the style pages the darlings of viral marketeers and the marks of predatory real estate agents
1317603 and they must be buried for cool to be reborn
1317604 yeah i dont know you shouldnt use that word its just
1317605 no its just well if you dont know why then you just shouldnt even use it
1317606 ok so what are you girls doing tonight after this party
1317607 im dubious of these hypotheses because they always smell of an agenda
1317608 youre not some club kid in new york in the nineties this shit is so hipster
1317609 if you dont give a damn we dont give a fuck
1317610 if only we carried rocks instead of cameras wed look like revolutionaries
1317611 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1317612 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1317613 irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program
1317614 barring this the best they could hope for is that israels conventional air assault will destroy their nuclear facilities
1317615 to be sure this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation but the alternative is an iran turned into a nuclear wasteland
1317616 barack obamas note was approved for publication in the international media even before he put it in the kotel wailing wall a short time after he wrote it at the king david hotel in jerusalem
1317617 obama submitted a copy of the note to media outlets when he left his hotel in jerusalem
1317618 managed the event brilliantly if deceptively getting the double benefit of appearing to be victimized by the invasive israeli press and prayer thieving jew while at the same time leaking out his humble christian plea to the lord
1317619 a relatively slick video appeared on youtube that blended obamas western wall prayer with various church scenes crosses aplenty a dove of peace and a soundtrack based on amazing grace
1317620 our forces are capable of taking over the security in all iraqi provinces within a year and a half
1317621 take over the security portfolio entirely and keep some sic multinational forces only in a supporting role
1317622 within three to six months our need for the american troops will dramatically go down
1317623 if our people return and take back this lost land its a success
1317624 if we are killed trying to do so we have received martyrdom and this will be a great success for us too
1317625 if we are thrown out of kandahar we will go to the mountains and start the guerrilla war as we did with the russians
1317626 it is the very nature of orthodoxy to be fragmented
1317627 may they all be one that the world may believe
1317628 how should i struggle with this desire which is not at the moment able to be consummated with the churchs blessing while the church itself struggles to find clarity between the prophetic and the conciliar
1317629 well currently the church does not bless homosexual relationships though it may in the future so i am afraid that as of now any such relationship you have stands outside of the churchs blessing
1317630 well if i carry on the homosexual relationship now and the church in the future does bless such relationships even if this comes after i die will the general blessing of the church in some fashion reciprocate back to my relationship
1317631 now is the time for a real debate on the future of public sector sports broadcasting which i know is under consideration and under review
1317632 all these people interested in cricket buy tv licences and surely they should have a right to expect that the public sector broadcasters mount bids for the nations summer sport as they do in the case of one of them for 12 other sports
1317633 after all just how many people play formula one if the bbc is to remain part of this it must answer to the millions of cricket fans in england and wales how it prioritises its investment in sports rights
1317634 we held extensive talks with all broadcasters and were determined to be as flexible as possible
1317635 the ecb recognise and are grateful for sky sports loyalty to the sport both at home and when the england team tour overseas
1317636 the bbc is astonished by the comments by the ecb
1317637 weve always said any bid for live test cricket was subject to value for money and fitting into scheduling and in our view neither of these criteria were met
1317638 we have consistently argued that not having cricket as a listed event puts it out of the reach of all terrestrial broadcasters
1317639 thats the ecbs choice and they are entitled to it but its absurd to blame the bbc for this outcome
1317640 i didnt want to see police follow me every day
1317641 its cheaper than a taxi i dont have to pay
1317642 focused too strongly on recovering arrears according to a strict mandate without reference to the borrowers circumstances
1317643 as our data shows in these current market conditions more people are struggling to meet their mortgage payments and it is vital that firms treat them fairly
1317644 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store

1317651 very very serious indeed so serious that custody would be an option
1317652 both the harassment and the criminal damage offences were targeted very often to homes of the individuals involved and were vindictive in nature
1317653 by your own admission this course of action was intimidatory
1317654 the nightmare of the last three years may finally be coming to an end
1317655 this has been a traumatic period for all those who have suffered from his vile campaign to defame intimidate and terrorise people simply for expressing support for a political party
1317656 failed to investigate the matter properly and to ensure that such an appalling course of events is never repeated
1317657 this was a disgraceful and criminal campaign aimed at intimidating candidates and voters and subverting the democratic process
1317658 mitch has been a regular contributor to bbc london calling into our phone in shows
1317659 he always has something worthwhile to say and a good sense of humour
1317660 although mitchs life is extraordinary because of amy hes still a london dad and i think our listeners can relate to him in that way
1317661 you need to bear in mind that the eu state aid rules do not allow for a drip feed of capital into the bank we have selected an amount that we believe is comfortable for the whole period of temporary public ownership
1317662 we are clearly looking at a housing market which has deteriorated very considerably in recent months
1317663 we do not expect markets to ease substantially in the near future we do think the economic climate and the housing market is going to be difficult for some considerable time
1317664 he confortola is out of danger he will stay at the base camp for a night and the armys pilots will fly helicopters on wednesday morning to rescue him if the weather has improved there
1317665 are holding up well and are very proud of gers achievement and are still in total shock in relation to the fact that he may not be coming back
1317666 at high altitude at over 8 000 meters 26 250 feet it is too dangerous to mount a rescue to have the bodies returned
1317667 tucker gives 100 percent every time he is on the ice
1317668 he is gritty doesnt back down and was a big part of our success during the first round of the playoffs
1317669 its an honor to be able to come back and play with the icehawks again
1317670 i think we have a good thing going in port huron from the ownership all the way down to the ice we were one shot away from a championship last year with coach drulia and the group of guys we have coming back i see no reason why we cant bring home the trophy this season
1317671 both elmar mammadyarov and edward nalbandian told a news conference that their tete a tete discussion was held in a positive vein
1317672 to reach a political settlement of the nagorno karabakh conflict armenia and azerbaijan will eventually have to reach a compromise on nks status we cannot predict what that compromise will look like or when it will emerge but the co chairs recommend that the residents of nagorno karabakh play a key role in determining their regions status through some type of vote in the future
1317673 official yerevan should stop talks on karabakh settlement in the framework of the osce minsk group
1317674 actually armenias move may drive turkey into a corner guls rejection to visit armenia may be evaluated as unavailability to launch a dialogue with armenia while armenians consider the possible visit of turkish president as the start of dialogue between the countries
1317675 if you just know how to type that can be the difference between earning 1 an hour instead of 1 a day
1317676 i was rather fuming because when we actually filmed it we had peter jones saying all sorts of stupid things but it was two and half hours of filming cut to fifteen minutes
1317677 we wanted to do an awareness piece but at the same time if we could get some investment it was a bonus hopefully whatever the outcome people are now thinking about how much energy their computers use and will think twice about buying their next computer whatever that happens to be
1317678 we explained our green principles about how we make them energy saving okay we buy off the shelf parts but thats because if we bought our own custom boards it would cost billions
1317679 what they didnt get or what wasnt shown was how we modify the parts to make them as energy efficient as possible which is a bit of a pain we modify the bioses we add software we wouldnt want to be in the business of manufacturing circuit boards
1317680 i was mightily unimpressed with so called expert peter jones
1317681 they may have been right about the company being a little overvalued but there was no need for them to get their panties in such a bunch

1317693 the air is a serious concern for all the athletes going over there
1317694 you try to find as many natural ways to help as you can

1317696 id wager times and distance events will be well under previous olympics and that will be proof right there
1317697 youll hear more horror stories when these people who are trying to compete go out there and have trouble and say i just couldnt do it
1317698 you cant get oxygen to the working muscles so it would certainly affect their exercise performance
1317699 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple things but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tuneups youd actually save just as much

1317709 was sarrazin vom stapel l sst das ist einfach nur menschenverachtende ideologie so einer muss aus der spd fliegen

1317735 we know that there are zenaida gonzaleses out there the zenaida gonzales that has been talked to us by casey is nonexistent to this point

1317755 music mishap and adventure drive the storylines and keep kids engaged so they have fun learning and in turn help remind their parents about how to behave in everyday situations

1317758 were not only getting our authentic rio style acai products into the marketplace but we are also helping to protect the amazon rainforest the demand for acai berries has created a sustainable agricultural industry and provides fair trade income to local workers
1317759 the acai palm trees used to be cut down for the heart of palm and now they have a new life and purpose our families live and work in brazil and through acai roots we too can give back to our native country what started as a way the three of us could bring a taste of our energetic healthy lifestyle to the us has turned into a business that is changing lives
1317760 we need to be able to address a national energy strategy and then try to work on environmental efficiencies as part of that plan
1317761 we cant just start with things like emission standards at a time when were at a crisis with the entire national energy policy
1317762 there was not enough emphasis that if we move aggressively toward sustainable energy we will transform our energy costs
1317763 we were not as clear as we might have been
1317764 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1317765 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1317766 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1317767 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1317768 my heart goes out to the families of the victims as well as to the community and the whole u p i was raised in the up and i know how much we yoopers value the serenity and safety that goes with living there when i was a kid we didnt even have a lock on our front door it wasnt needed and were not talking that long ago this kind of senseless act will bring the community together but will also leave scars that will make people think twice about their safety
1317769 i demand to know where al gore is declaring that this rise in the lake levels is all just media bunk and that were all still doomed because of global warming
1317770 he wants to tax oil companies profits which will raise the price of gas and use the money to help motorist pay for the more expensive gas is this robbing peter to pay peter
1317771 like any dog this breed needs to be matched with the right owner i dont know much about this specific owner or the circumstances but pit bulls are often a thugged out status symbol and are not given the assertive leadership they require heck it may have to come to the point where one needs to be licensed to own certain breeds banning them may only increase their mystique and status amongst those ill equipped to care for them

1317776 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1317777 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
1317778 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
1317779 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1317780 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
1317781 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1317782 young gore sets out for his new home where the sky is clear the water is clean and there are no republicans
1317783 former vice president al gore who for the past three decades has unsuccessfully attempted to warn humanity of the coming destruction of our planet only to be mocked and derided by the very people he has tried to save launched his infant son into space monday in the faint hope that his only child would reach the safety of another world
1317784 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1317785 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
1317786 this is no fantasy no careless product of wild imagination no my friends these indictments that i have brought to you today specific charges herein against the individuals their acts of treason their ultimate aim of sedition these are matters of undeniable fact i ask you now to pronounce judgment on those accused
1317787 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will cause in the future catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
1317788 an overwhelming number of scientists have determined that catastrophic manmade global warming is real and that any further debate over the science is pointless
1317789 marketed not on the basis of science its about what is known or what can be proved about the natural world rather than the number of scientists who are willing to publicly commit to a particular opinion
1317790 an overwhelming number of scientists they are referring to scientists working under the auspices of the u n s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc that agrees man made greenhouse gas emissions are or will in the future wreak havoc on the climate
1317791 head counts of scientists seem to be the name of the global warming game
1317792 the white house has taken a beating over the years in the press on climate and facts no longer matter
1317793 the latest move was to list the polar bear as an endangered species
1317794 there are many more polar bears today than 40 years ago and predictions of the bears demise are entirely based on politically inspired speculation
1317795 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect other countries to say ok
1317796 regulate the pantries of america as well as thermostats and modes of personal transportation mccain and the bush administration are drinking the same kool aid the initial response from the bush administration to relevant new facts seems to be see no consensus hear no consensus speak no consensuses
1317797 a young man born in the middle of this century and from the middle of this country
1317798 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
1317799 presents a vivid alarming profile of americas current financial status
1317800 the story of americas four key deficits budget savings balance of payments and leadership
1317801 suggestions for how best to recreate a fiscally sound nation for future generations
1317802 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
1317803 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1317804 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
1317805 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1317806 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1317807 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1317808 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1317809 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1317810 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1317811 i hope my arrival here will lift up my old friends
1317812 it was a good start and im happy with the performance of the boys the team is new and the game was their first competitive match
1317813 what we need now is to give them more exposure and this is why we plan to have another international friendly match with senegal at the end of the month in dakar
1317814 the players were sent back home after it was established that they had carried themselves in a manner that is not acceptable
1317815 we understand that they were misled by someone purporting to be an agent who promised to take them to another team whilst ignoring the legal commitment they had with pirates
1317816 its a sad situation and we are busy consulting with our lawyers on this matter
1317817 if we had received the money as some people are saying you could tell from the level of excitement in our camp the truth is pirates have not yet paid us for the players we sold the players to pirates we wrote letters of release to pirates but the truth is they have not paid us for the players
1317818 we tried to organise a meeting for mafoko and mogorosi with the south african high commission so that they can explain their problems to him but they refused to come to the meeting
1317819 the issue of being left out in the starting line up has been haunting me for a long time and i feel now its the time to tell them that they mustnt call me for national duty if they feel im not good enough
1317820 if i continue sitting on the bench in the next game i will withdraw my services to the national team and concentrate on club football it will be better because im satisfied
1317821 people would want to say i play the same role as esrom but i dont think its the reason because we have been playing alongside each other for a long time now
1317822 i confronted him after our last match after i came in six minutes from time and he told me he wanted a strong bench
1317823 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
1317824 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1317825 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1317826 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
1317827 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
1317828 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
1317829 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
1317830 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
1317831 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
1317832 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
1317833 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
1317834 in the muslim school the teacher wrote to tell mother i made faces during koranic studies
1317835 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
1317836 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
1317837 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
1317838 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
1317839 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
1317840 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1317841 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1317842 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1317843 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
1317844 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
1317845 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
1317846 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
1317847 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1317848 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1317849 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
1317850 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
1317851 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
1317852 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
1317853 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
1317854 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1317855 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1317856 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1317857 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1317858 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1317859 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1317860 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1317861 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1317862 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1317863 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1317864 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1317865 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1317866 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1317867 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1317868 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1317869 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1317870 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1317871 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1317872 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1317873 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people what was good about this was that we got everybody involved
1317874 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1317875 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
1317876 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
1317877 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
1317878 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
1317879 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
1317880 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
1317881 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
1317882 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
1317883 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
1317884 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
1317885 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
1317886 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
1317887 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
1317888 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
1317889 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
1317890 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
1317891 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
1317892 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
1317893 chinas digital and online communities are the worlds leading users of mobile communication instant messaging and web 2
1317894 where most american netizens still rely on emails to communicate with each other their chinese counterparts use im and web 2 0 applications
1317895 many activities such as im and blogging china is more advanced than the united states and other western economies
1317896 an addition to the german alphabet has emerged blinking into the daylight after a campaign lasting 130 years to a hail of indifference
1317897 german norms institute din proposed a capital to the international organisation for standardisation and on monday the letter became standard with iso 10646
1317898 we are not responsible for letters but for keeping an eye on spelling and to make sure rules are followed whether there is a need for this letter is a question that remained unanswered for centuries its likely to remain that way for a while to come

1317902 creators of violent video games should be prosecuted if copycats take their content into real life its high time game makers face the legal consequences of their creations a top government official says
1317903 when a player copycats a crime he or she sees in the game the game maker should be prosecuted
1317904 prosecutions will automatically force game makers to act more responsibly
1317905 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
1317906 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
1317907 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
1317908 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
1317909 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
1317910 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
1317911 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
1317912 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
1317913 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
1317914 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
1317915 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
1317916 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
1317917 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
1317918 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
1317919 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
1317920 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
1317921 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
1317922 zur zeit ist eines der gr ten risiken dass die gegenw rtig ausgeschlossenen irgendwann geh r finden und ihren einfluss dann auf nationaler ebene wieder geltend machen daraus entsteht sowohl f r globale unternehmen als auch f r investoren eine herausforderung wie sch tzt man globale unternehmensstrukturen in einer zeit wo sich das l nderrisiko im weitesten sinne versch rft unternehmen m ssen sich gegen politische und soziale unruhen in den nationalstaaten sichern
1317923 der postmoderne imperialismus hat zwei komponenten die erste ist der freiwillige imperialismus der globalen konomie er wird normalerweise von einem internationalen konsortium durch internationale finanzinstitutionen wie iwf und weltbank ausge bt die zweite dimension des postmodernen imperialismus k nnte der imperialismus des nachbarn genannt werden instabilit t in der nachbarschaft stellt eine gefahr dar die kein staat ignorieren kann politische misswirtschaft ethnische gewalt und kriminalit t auf dem balkan stellen eine gefahr f r europa dar die antwort hierauf war eine art freiwilliges un protektorat im kosovo und in bosnien zu schaffen
1317924 freiwilligen imperialismus der glbalen konomie aus verst ndlichen gr nden nicht teilen
1317925 die herausforderung der postmodernen welt ist es mit der idee doppelter standards klarzukommen unter uns gehen wir auf der basis von gesetzen und offener kooperativer sicherheit um aber wenn es um traditionellere staaten au erhalb des postmodernen kontinents europa geht m ssen wir auf die raueren methoden einer vergangenen ra zur ckgreifen gewalt pr ventive angriffe irref hrung was auch immer n tig ist um mit denen klarzukommen die immer noch im 19 jahrhundert leben in dem jeder staat f r sich selber stand unter uns halten wir uns an das gesetz aber wenn wir im dschungel operieren m ssen wir ebenfalls das gesetz des dschungels anwenden
1317926 we had a positive meeting yesterday there is another set up to sort out the details and we expect it to be resolved before the end of play today
1317927 we have had a request for a 40 increase in fees from our referees
1317928 they put forward three comparators they wanted us to base our decision on and there was no written support for that
1317929 they recognised that there is a need for a detailed review and study and yesterday we proposed how that might be done and today we are meeting to chart the way forward
1317930 things i think are moving in absolutely the right direction
1317931 i should say that since the spl started our referees have had an increase in the fee of 140 and our income has not increased anywhere like that level
1317932 but i think we are at the position with our referee colleagues that we have to get back to business as usual
1317933 it was only july 25 that we were faced with these comparators and it was only at that point we could start working on the proposal
1317934 everything is all for discussion we are only at the discussion stage
1317935 as far as were concerned weve agreed everything that we can over marlon king
1317936 its a three way situation in the transfer one between us and wigan two between us and the player and finally between the player and wigan
1317937 two of those aspects have been agreed but its down to what happens between the player and wigan now the agent has put wigan in a very difficult position
1317938 i am beginning to get the impression that the move might be driven by money more than ambition
1317939 at this stage its not clear if thats down to the agent or the player
1317940 when i said earlier in the summer that i want birmingham to win the title that wasnt meant as an ultimatum
1317941 i simply saw no reason to announce were aiming for the play offs when we could be good enough to finish top of the championship
1317942 we may have to settle for the play offs of course but this season is all about putting some pride back into the club
1317943 lassana got a bit of a knock but hell be alright
1317944 it was a bit of a crazy tackle but he managed to get out the way and just got clipped
1317945 i think he got a bit of cramp getting out of the way of the challenge but he should be okay for sunday
1317946 hes a bit behind the rest because he got an extra period of time off after the european championships
1317947 hes got a bit of catching up to do in regards of his general fitness
1317948 weve gone from a well organised well drilled back room staff to one that feels like its been patched together a lot of us wanted to give him a chance to see how it worked out but its not looking too good
1317949 a strange appointment that gets stranger i hope he is given a chance as moyes was in a similar postion and im sure blackburn would love to have him
1317950 is this true i sure hope its just an evil rumour ohterwise how the hell is this going to work out
1317951 waktu saya rapat sebelum saya berangkat swiss dinyatakan aman kalau harga naik karena musiman sebelum lebaran itu pasti terjadi musim puasa lebaran biasa terjadi kita harapkan tidak akan melebihi dari yang biasa
1317952 antisipasinya kita akan pantau terus agar tidak terjadi gangguan terutama dalam gangguan distribusi apakah dari jalan rusak dan kemacetan jalan
1317953 kita sesuai dengan target yang kita canangkan yaitu depdag tadinya 14 5 setelah melihat keadaan dunia kita turunkan menjadi 12 minimal kita harapkan
1317954 saya melihat bahwa kalau amerika lebih terpengaruh kurs ekspor kita ke as kita tidak terlalu besar misalnya dengan elektronik malaysia kita mendapatkan keuntungan dari berkurangnya mereka mengambil dari china jadi terjadi pemindahan kita terjadi peningkatan ekspor garmen dan sepatu dibanding ekspor elektronik malaysia langsung anjlok
1317955 salah satu yang menjadi pilar ekonomi kreatif adalah masalah modal kami akan ada mou dengan bni 46 untuk mengembangkan ekonomi kreatif
1317956 dimana mana di dunia ekonomi kreatif belum terlalu dikenal oleh perbankan kalau di bi mungkin belum ada tuh ekonomi kreatif
1317957 pada periode ini kita harapkan bisa muncul 200 brand lokal yang terpercaya
1317958 perkembangannya kota ini memang natural daerah yang akan kita kembangkan menjadi dua kali lipat yang sekarang 3 menjadi 6 misalnya
1317959 melihat kinerja penjualan otomotif di semester i lalu kami memperkirakan penjualan mobil akan mencapai 520 ribu unit sedangkan motor 6 juta unit
1317960 berdasarkan pencapaian tersebut kami bersama kalangan produsen otomotif merevisi target penjualan mobil dan motor di 2008
1317961 perkiraan kami agar industri ini tetap tumbuh bi rate paling tinggi di posisi 9 5 itu pun dengan asumsi produsen otomotif menekan marjinnya
1317962 pada 2005 saya mundur sebagai presdir lalu 2006 saya sudah pemunduran saya dari komisais sudah beres jadi kasus saya salah alamat tapi karena menkeu nggak punya alamat direksi yang baru yang dicekal jeffery mulyono ya marah lah saya
1317963 jadi depkeu yang punya utang untuk mengembalikan utang ke perusahaan batubara karena ngak dibayar bayar lalu pkp2b generasi 1 menahan sebagaian pnbp dan proses ini pun susah diajukan ke ptun sekarang ada yang sedang banding
1317964 itu semua kan sedang dalam urusan pupn jadi oleh menteri esdm piutang itu diserahkan ke menkeu untuk dilakukan pengurusan piutang nah salah satu langkah pengurusan piutang itu adalah dengan melakukan pencegahan
1317965 kan penanggung jawab urusan dalam piutang negara adalah komisaris dan direksi dari perusahaan yang bersangkutan mereka yang diminta tanggung jawab untuk piutang itu karena kan piutang ini kan piutang pnbp penerimaan negara bukan pajak utang ke kas negara kok nggak dibayar
1317966 pencegahan itu adalah salah satu langkah dari penagihan piutang negara agar selesai pencekalan mau kooperatif supaya mau membayar jadi bayar saja kalau sudah dibayar kan tidak ada kepentingan kita cekal orang orang bisa berbisnis dengan tenang
1317967 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
1317968 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
1317969 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
1317970 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1317971 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1317972 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
1317973 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
1317974 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
1317975 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
1317976 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
1317977 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
1317978 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
1317979 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1317980 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1317981 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1317982 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1317983 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
1317984 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1317985 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
1317986 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1317987 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1317988 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1317989 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1317990 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1317991 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
1317992 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
1317993 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
1317994 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
1317995 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
1317996 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
1317997 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
1317998 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
1317999 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1318000 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1318001 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1318002 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1318003 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1318004 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1318005 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
1318006 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
1318007 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
1318008 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
1318009 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
1318010 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1318011 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
1318012 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
1318013 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
1318014 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
1318015 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
1318016 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
1318017 if the vice president says its do able i believe
1318018 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
1318019 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
1318020 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
1318021 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1318022 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1318023 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1318024 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1318025 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1318026 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1318027 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1318028 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
1318029 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
1318030 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
1318031 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
1318032 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
1318033 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
1318034 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
1318035 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
1318036 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
1318037 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
1318038 el dinero no da la felicidad pero procura una sensaci n tan parecida que necesita un especialista muy avanzado para verificar la diferencia
1318039 el dinero es algo muy singular le da al hombre tanta alegr a como el amor y tanta angustia como la muerte
1318040 ohhh als ik mij dan toch in moet schrijven bij de kvk dan heeft dat ook zo zijn voordelen pasjes groothandel en grijze kentekens
1318041 we will hit those points in a few years and that will help in many ways
1318042 we just have to survive through this part of the cycle
1318043 more delinquencies look like they are on the horizon because so few of them have reset
1318044 democracy is a means of living together despite our differences democratic deliberation is an alternative to physical violence it is predicated on the assumption that its possible to disagree agreeably that its better to laugh than cry that one can vigorously contest the positions of ones adversary without questioning his or her personal integrity or motivation and that parties to a debate are entitled to the presumption that their views are legitimate if not correct
1318045 re unfinished pathetic dramas do not click this thread doh
1318046 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1318047 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
1318048 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
1318049 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
1318050 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
1318051 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
1318052 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
1318053 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
1318054 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
1318055 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
1318056 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
1318057 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
1318058 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
1318059 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1318060 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1318061 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1318062 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1318063 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1318064 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
1318065 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
1318066 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
1318067 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
1318068 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
1318069 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
1318070 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
1318071 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
1318072 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
1318073 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
1318074 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
1318075 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
1318076 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
1318077 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
1318078 have not generated the increases in profit and cash flow anticipated
1318079 we do expect to succeed with the 39 stores and be a dominant player in the market that were known in in the years to come
1318080 its a question of getting the creditors to believe its better for them to hang in there and allow the workout to happen
1318081 you do not see a whole lot of examples of retailers shrinking attractively
1318082 it just doesnt happen that often doesnt mean it cant happen
1318083 its been an emotional roller coaster for each one of us in our own way
1318084 ive got to say that the familys been extremely supportive every one of them
1318085 i think its important to all of us that we recognize that we are family
1318086 and at the end of the day maybe thats the most important thing
1318087 no suelo entrar en foros ni nada de sto porque considero que nadie entra nunca a aplaudir si no a hundir al personal pero en ste caso y como experiencia particular voy a ser muy muy objetivo citi y

1318219 this was the first time i had a chance to make my own record it seemed like circa was coming up on a break one of the first since the band started in 2004 and everybody in the band felt like they needed it and i didnt feel like i needed it at all
1318220 i had a pretty good list of songs but i dont think i even made an actual list to record until the day before i had practiced stuff and had ideas but there are actually a bunch of songs that i didnt get to record because they werent as developed as everything else
1318221 writing the music with circa is a huge collaboration with five dudes having their say and hands in everything whereas with this i call all the shots
1318222 like if i thought it wasnt good and i wanted to sing it again i did its kind of nice to have something that youre not checking in with anyone else to see if its cool or not its nice to be able to do whatever the f you want
1318223 this stuff is way easier for me than circa stuff i take a less nervous approach to everything than the rest of the dudes in my band do like if i feel good about something thats it i dont second guess it that instinct has gotten so much stronger with doing this project i think i see it meshing and melting into everybody else in circa
1318224 they both asked me if they could come on the tour and i was like f yeah we need a bass player anyway and brendans playing guitar i feel like everybody is getting inspired by everybody else right now its a really good vibe in the circa house right now
1318225 ive gotten better at guitar over the years im still not very good at all
1318226 i think these songs make me move different than circa songs like when i hear circa and the mixture of all those dudes and what theyre doing my body starts going crazy like in the movie weekend at bernies i just start feeling it and i cannot control whats happening to me with these songs its very much the same feeling but its just different types of movement its more low to the ground than it is like trying to reach up to the sky i feel like im more buoyant with circa with this stuff im a little bit more low to the ground
1318227 with this band its the first or second takes on nearly all the album

1318318 it is nearly impossible to pin down from the word go so ill do my very best at a quick description first off it has loads of strings and horns on it and its pretty catchy i think people will definitely be surprised with some of the songs it is ballsier riskier less cluttered simpler and definitely more eclectic than any of our previous records the lyrics are far less personal than before and i definitely think we covered much new ground thematically and musically the experts music is extremely varied it has bits of indie reggae funk four to the floor dance psych and theme tune walk in the ring type hip hop at this stage we just cant wait for you to hear it
1318319 its intended aim was to improve the cars sensitivity during yaw but we found that some of the advantage it brought to that area was being offset elsewhere
1318320 as you can clearly see it is a large structure and one that is particularly sensitive to crosswinds
1318321 we felt that our car already delivers sufficiently in yaw and that continuing to experiment with the dorsal fin might not bring us the sufficient performance benefit wed require to make it worthwhile
1318322 as such it is not something we are giving priority to at the moment

1318332 imagine if all those people acted to cut carbon emissions in all they did this would be true collective action millions of people who through their own unique individual actions would be working towards a common shared goal of protecting the environment the green movement would become a mass movement in green consumption thats our goal

1318345 i knew it was gone right when it came off the bat
1318346 they were to a greater distance behind but they got their acts together
1318347 are you a clooney woman or do you prefer pitt
1318348 i mean i dont really know why im asking it could hardly be more obvious its written all over your face
1318349 oh as if we couldnt find a thousand better things to discuss
1318350 how do you put up with her monstrous ego spencer
1318351 i think shes been in love with you since she was 18 years old as well
1318352 nonetheless i think youve always been it for her spencer
1318353 let me tell you something about my sister the arrogance is all an act its how she hides how deeply insecure she really is for all our father loved us both he was never really there for either of us and that hurt ashley a lot more than me i mean i was the mistresss kid and i knew the score i never expected to see my father but ashley idolised him and she took every missed birthday or christmas or school play as proof that she wasnt worth his love anyones love and christine
1318354 you cant just assume that she knows even after all these years i honestly think she expects me to abandon her just like everyone else shes ever allowed herself to love including you
1318355 thats not fair kyla i never abandoned her what did or didnt happen between us wasnt all on me she wasnt any more ready than i was back then it wasnt anyones fault
1318356 oh come on any fool could see that she only kept aiden around because he was her security blanket if all else failed good old dependable aiden was always there to tell her that she was hot and that he loved her he was an instant confidence boost with no reciprocation or effort required on her part what she had with him was safe
1318357 you two are really as bad as each other you know she married aiden to prove to herself that she wasnt in love with you and when her marriage fell apart it just proved to her even more that she wasnt worthy of love at all
1318358 i dunno spence shes so terrified of being hurt that she makes herself hard to love it takes effort
1318359 until this week the only times ive ever seen my sister truly happy was when she was talking about you and now i can see that shes even happier when shes around you shes my sister spencer and i thats all i want for her to be happy and i dont think she can be without you
1318360 she didnt but its still true and anyway youre still not getting what im trying to tell you what i was trying to say before when i asked if you thought she sees it that way was that the one thing i do know is that she blames herself totally for what happened between you in college she doesnt blame you at all she thinks she just wasnt good enough for you
1318361 well i think im going to skip dessert and just head off to bed
1318362 i hope to see you again before i go spence
1318363 nah but eddies more of a family friend he was one of my dads session musicians

1318368 una regione immobilizzata che chiudeva le porte al mondo esterno disposta privarsi delle stesse fonti di approviggionamento primario e decisa a resistere ad oltranza tutti insieme con un unico obiettivo scanzare le scorie
1318369 ogni lucano in cuor suo sa di aver compiuto una grandissima impresa ogni lucano ha ora il dovere di farne tesoro girovagando e non solo in basilicata si percepisce ancora leco di quei giorni il senso di civilt derivante da una protesta giusta oggi convertita in proposta si sente nei cuori di chi ha partecipato tra le persone che si sono unite nellintimo sentire delle nostre terre silenziose

1318376 few biblical interpreters have delved as deeply into the science of the human brain as joel green
1318377 if you think nothing new ever happens in theology or biblical studies you need to read this book an essay in neuro hermeneutics
1318378 joel green serves as the vanguard of interdisciplinary research on this topic
1318379 in this outstanding work the author provides a scholarly and thoroughly biblical analysis of human personhood in dialogue with the neurosciences

1318389 let me say this ive never been more nervous on the field in my life
1318390 ill stand out there in the rain storm all day long but thunder and lightning in that kind of proximity its definitely a hazard
1318391 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were said im sorry youre not going to know
1318392 its private its between us and its not a big deal and its not the first time it ever happened and it wont be the last
1318393 growing up in texas you see those kinds of storms all the time you learn that lightning is nothing to fool around with
1318394 if they had continued the game i wouldnt have gone back out there not for a while
1318395 like i said before the inning you have to be an idiot to stand outside during a lightning storm thats just common sense
1318396 when the last one hit it was too close even for us and i pulled them off i would never put any team or player or umpire in harms way
1318397 it was pretty crazy lightning and tornado sirens going off the weather was pretty nuts
1318398 actually it looked like somebody stood above the stadium with a ziplock bag full of water and opened it up it really did you could barely even see right field
1318399 amir haider khan was the most dangerous individual in british india
1318400 bhima used to bully duryodhana and the other kauravas by dragging them by the hair and beating them a great swimmer he would dive into pools with one or more of them clasped helpless in his arms and remain underwater till they were almost drowned whenever they climbed up on the tree he would stand on the ground and kicked at the tree and shake them down like ripe fruits
1318401 duryodhana was very much worried his father being blind the kingdom was ruled by pandu after his death yudhishthira the heir apparent would in course of time become king duryodhana thought that as his blind father was quite helpless he must to prevent yudhishthiras accession to the throne contrive a way of killing bhima he made arrangements to carry out his resolve since he thought that the powers of the pandavas would decline with the death of bhima duryodhana and his brothers planned to throw bhima into the ganges imprisoned arjuna and yudhishthira and then seize the kingdom and rule it
1318402 with dronas leave karna the lover of battle then and there duplicated all arjunas feats with careless ease great was duryodhanas exultation he threw his arms around karna welcome o thou with mighty arms whom good fortune has sent to us i and his kingdom of the kurus are at your command

1318404 the two year delay by statssa in implementing the rebasing and reweighing of the inflation basket is having serious implications for the economy calculations by investec asset management have shown that the real inflation rate in the economy is probably far lower than the official inflation number
1318405 official cpix for may was 10 9 percent but had the numbers been rebased and reweighed last year as they should have been our calculations show actual cpix of 8 7 percent
1318406 the official peak in inflation will be in the order of 13 percent once the impact of electricity tariff adjustments is fully incorporated

1318409 across the nation the thirst for biblical truth and justice is creating a movement of progressive ideas and voices the red letter christians with their distinguishable faith backgrounds and biblical knowledge are speaking out and leading this movement
1318410 failure of biblical scholars to educate the public about the historical jesus
1318411 red letter words in the holy bible spoken by jesus
1318412 assess the historicity of everything attributed to jesus in all christian sources from the first three centuries this goal was pursued in two phases first the words of jesus then his deeds
1318413 whoever finds the interpretation of these sayings will not taste death
1318414 most scholars today have abandoned these identifications and recognize that the books were written by otherwise unknown but relatively well educated greek speaking and writing christians during the second half of the first century
1318415 he who desires to be divorced for any reason whatsoever from the wife who is living with him must certify in writing that he will have no further relations with her since in this way will the woman obtain the right to cohabit with another man
1318416 it turns out that she does not find favor in his eyes because he has found an indecency of something about her
1318417 biblical archeologists are suddenly finding themselves in a position similar to the evolutionary biologists fighting intelligent design an entire parallel version of their field is being driven by religious belief not research principles
1318418 shall a land be born in one day or shall a nation be brought forth in one moment for as soon as zion travailed she brought forth her children

1318443 we shall now consider what the bible claims for itself

1318465 his condition is not good he has some bruises and frostbite and exhaustion

1318470 i hate the image of a woman as a modeling clay doll that has to look after her children and make herself beautiful for her husband
1318471 why dont women have a mixed image of beauty and strength
1318472 a woman has to be independent and she doesnt need to ask a man to give her a hand with every single thing she does
1318473 we men and women are equal and we complement one another and we women are not supposed to be totally submissive to mens wishes and orders

1318483 the wine trials 100 everyday wines under 15 that beat 50 to 150 wines in brown bag blind tastings
1318484 most wine in the world is cheap wine its only in the last 10 years or so that wines over 50 have taken off its really a success of marketing not taste
1318485 there have always been good wines and better wines but the luxury products manufacturers and the mass brands got really smart about marketing their products
1318486 i was trying for a broad swath of wine drinkers
1318487 it is a miracle for me because i was able to smile again laugh again and just feel alive again

1318498 si se presentaran dos candidaturas y una de ellas fuese la de rosa aguilar sta quitar a muchos votos a llamazares aunque hay otras posibilidades a n no confirmadas
1318499 ante declaraciones a la prensa como esta llegan amenazas de apertura de expediente
1318500 lo que demuestra que llamazares y los suyos hablan de manera muy general sobre republicanismo pero no apoyan iniciativas concretas como esta
1318501 es necesario presentar una alternativa de izquierdas muy seria mucha gente no vota al psoe pero no conf a en el discurso actual de iu es necesario dirigirse a ese mont n de gente que se abstiene que duda que cree que somos parte del sistema si no el nico pa s en el que desaparecer electoralmente la izquierda transformadora ser en espa a

1318511 how really serious about their politics these nice people must be since they gave more money than the median yearly income for the lower middle class neighborhood they live in

1318513 the district of columbias so called emergency regulations prohibit law abiding citizens from protecting themselves and their loved ones in their own homes
1318514 the mayor and city council have proposed a list of regulations that violate the supreme courts decision
1318515 the districts ban on handgun possession in the home violates the second amendment as does its prohibition against rendering any lawful firearm in the home operable for the purpose of immediate self defense
1318516 the d c council and mayor are demonstrating their arrogant disregard for the supreme courts decision and the safety and liberty of their own law abiding constituents
1318517 these elitist politicians who live under secured protection are continuing to prevent their residents from keeping a functional firearm in the home for self defense nra will continue to work to restore the rights of d c residents

1318639 the heat was a big part of practice today and we didnt do as good a job dealing with it as we needed to

1318641 the speed and intensity and tempo of the practice putting that together with the heat it was extremely tough defensive end adrian davis now wearing no 18 said the heat is an acquired taste
1318642 weve got to come out here every day and get used to it
1318643 we worked out a little bit in the summer with the heat but running full speed every play youve got to get used to it
1318644 we did get a lot of things accomplished and it was good to see the freshmen out here by themselves
1318645 we taught them some individual drills and they look like a good group
1318646 looking for some tough guys if the opening practice was any indication petrino said he thinks hes got some tough freshmen who could contribute this fall
1318647 coach told us when he signed us that we were going to come in here and work so i wasnt surprised at all
1318648 that tells us that we could get in and help the team out at different positions while the freshmen didnt have a perfect day the speed and play making ability for which they have been touted was on display

1318739 following some well informed press speculation in this mornings independent michael page has confirmed it has received an unsolicited preliminary approach from adecco the swiss recruitment company regarding a possible offer for the group although the two companies have been linked in the past investors should be aware that they operate different business models in difference sectors of the market michael page is more focused on white collar recruitment whilst adecco targets the blue collar market

1318765 dai sacerdoti i fedeli attendono soltanto una cosa che siano degli specialisti nel promuovere lincontro delluomo con dio al sacerdote non si chiede di essere esperto in economia in edilizia o in politica da lui ci si attende che sia esperto nella vita spirituale

1318768 il sacerdote deve essere uno che vigila deve stare in guardia di fronte alle potenze incalzanti del male deve tener sveglio il mondo per dio deve essere uno che sta in piedi dritto di fronte alle correnti del tempo dritto nella verit dritto nellimpegno per il bene
1318769 questo il bel compito delluomo pregare ed amare se voi pregate ed amate questa la felicit delluomo sulla terra la preghiera nientaltro che lunione con dio in questa unione intima dio e lanima sono come due pezzi di cera fusi insieme che nessuno pu pi separare

1318907 no bub im taking care of sick people all day long with the bed pans and the sheet changing you think i want you because i have pity for you because you cant see because youve been injured you think i want to take care of you
1318908 no i want you because i know youre about to inherit a large sum of money so please let me love you
1318909 there are certain principles im very uncompromising about and one is that carnatic music shouldnt be degraded at any point
1318910 i just wanted to make sure that what i was singing is what i believe i value otherwise i wont give my heart and soul to it
1318911 earlier gowri had asked me to sing for this beautiful play she had written called dark horse it had classical music interwoven throughout it was a lovely experience so when she approached me for this i agreed immediately
1318912 because of his ability to communicate to an audience also were friends so id have the freedom to tell him how exactly i wanted him to perform
1318913 i told him when you sing this piece the audience should forget this world and regain the values they have lost
1318914 shanti nilava vendum ive sung in concerts sangeetha has sung in concerts but there the emotional content would be lyrical musical or a combination of both but here its about making the music a part of the drama and that requires a different mental tuning it was very very interesting to go through that process
1318915 it was not easy sangeetha had to keep making sure i was sticking to the plan
1318916 the emotive element is entirely from the songs so in our performance we had to enhance the emotions
1318917 its a dream sequence with these guys thinking about this girl from calcutta we had to sing in such a way even if the audience didnt follow the language they would pretty much get the fact that this is a romantic fantasy trip
1318918 its not your hardcore carnatic audience even the actors didnt know much about classical music
1318919 even those who had no clue about ragas and talas started getting involved in the songs the mother of one of the crew members came up and said that after this her son had become a big carnatic music fan
1318920 it could even be a villain maybe someone like gabbar singh
1318921 that was a very well written character usually villains are totally black but he had a background to his vendetta because he was arrested he was put behind bars etc i would have loved to do that part
1318922 the role that naseer played in sparsh i had a smaller part about three four scenes but what naseer did was wonderful also salim and guru dutts role in pyaasa
1318923 bimal roy mehboob khan guru dutt raj kapoor v shantaram im talking about the old shantaram do aankhen barah haath
1318924 pyaasa sujata bandini yes two bimal roy films he is at the top of my list mughal e azam and jagte raho the early raj kapoor is a big favourite his films were entertaining they had mass appeal and at the same time they carried a message foreign films id say taxi driver lawrence of arabia doctor zhivago my left foot and anything with chaplin
1318925 i grit my teeth and decide to dive into clich the parallel cinema movement of the eighties the big four heck hes been asked about these things so many times hell probably start answering before ive finished my questions and ill have at least
1318926 in that period between eighty and ninety a whole lot of art films were being made in bombay in bengal in kerala i was doing four five films a year every indian panorama i remember during that period had two or three of my films today rahul bose is a wonderful actor but hes not making films at that rate because the films are not happening
1318927 we were lucky that we had great directors to work with satyajit ray mrinal sen utpalendu chakrabarti shyam benegal govind nihalani nihalani was making a film practically every year
1318928 rekha was the first star i think who did art films at the peak of her career otherwise stars didnt want to be part of art cinema today they want that respect they want to do different characters look at mr bachchan or aamir khan or whats the name of pataudis son saif ali
1318929 now there is an awareness that you cant make up things as you go along that you need a script and the young directors you are referring to rajkumar santoshi sanjay leela bhansali vinod chopra prakash jha vishal bhardwaj they want to make good films in a commercial form films like apaharan omkara khakee and sarkar go back to our old traditions bimal roy did the same v shantaram did the same raj kapoor did the same they used songs and dances in their films in a good way
1318930 the only reason one dislikes song and dance sequences is when they are meaningless
1318931 khakee is a wonderful film but i dont know what that ridiculous aisa jadoo song was doing there similarly chhamma chhamma in china gate it was like a patch you could remove it and the film would still work songs are supposed to be part of your structure your theme and they should have poetry today most songs have no poetry
1318932 but what im saying is that when we see old films say pyaasa that song jinhe naaz hai hind par no amount of speech or dialogue would have been so effective the song moves you and it comments on a social situation
1318933 it had nice music and it did well then there was paththar i did not mouth a song but it was in the background it was one of my first commercial films 1982 i think
1318934 sometimes your choice can go wrong but yes you do try to do different kinds of roles sparsh i did though it was a very small part because i got to play a blind man rang de basanti too it was just two three scenes but rakeysh mehra said hed be happy if i did the part but thats okay its a good film and id rather be part of a good film even if its a small part
1318935 it was very different and it was very thought provoking even the character i played had a lot of thought put into it hes a muslim father who feels insecure hes protective of his son and he has certain grievances against the hindu community which according to his experience may be justifiable
1318936 i think it is did anybody expect that jp jayaprakash narayan who was a gandhian would ask students to protest and boycott schools and colleges because you get fed up when you are not heard and when those at the helm of affairs do not respond to your gentle demands people do get angry and take extreme measures
1318937 because there is so much apathy in the youth they feel nothing is going to change so they do nothing but movies say you can change things you can participate maybe you dont have to go to the rang de extent and in any case the film wasnt advocating terrorism according to britishers bhagat singh was a terrorist but in our eyes he was a revolutionary i would say he was a true terrorist that is if you want to call him a terrorist he was a terrorist with ethics today terrorists dont have ethics he did not kill innocent people and even in parliament if he threw a bomb it was a bomb that couldnt have hurt anybody
1318938 when you look back critically on your work there are bound to be a few things here and there but those are negligible
1318939 tamas susman ardh satya aakrosh aaghat drohkaal all of nihalanis films then aarohan jaane bhi do yaaron dhoop that was a tiny budget movie and could have been better structured but it was a sincere effort
1318940 it was a true story i met the father in delhi
1318941 after working for 30 years its not difficult to play characters really most of the time it comes naturally unless you are doing something complex at the moment and for the last few years ive not been doing anything complex im working in regular commercial films where the roles have not been very demanding
1318942 i feel cinema is such an important medium it can enrich society nobodys denying the entertainment part of it the fifties and sixties cinema it was entertaining chalti ka naam gaadi was an entertaining film but at the same time they were making garam coat they were making sujata and bandini which dealt with social problems that balance is not there anymore
1318943 thats not true khakee was a successful film so was ardh satya which was not very long ago so was aakrosh so was satya these films were not entertaining as such but they were popular what the audiences want is to be involved and thats the filmmakers responsibility they dont necessarily demand songs and dances in aakrosh for example you know that this man is being implicated by influential people in the village and that the law is being twisted this happens all the time to people and so they get involved
1318944 see theres still a disappointment in people the newspapers are full of stories of so and so being caught or implicated ordinary men get imprisoned and hanged but nothing happens to the big guys
1318945 they can only protest and the protests are not heard therefore the rang de kind of thing happens
1318946 it is a justified response the law has to be equal for everybody only then will there be a certain amount of positivity in peoples attitudes towards society
1318947 otherwise youngsters today they dont get into professional courses 15 years ago it was i want to be a doctor i want to be an engineer now they all want to become businessmen and make money
1318948 i think i only remember the amusing things i dont remember any depressing things i think i just put them out of my mind i know everybody has things that they want to forget but i dont even have to forget i just dont remember
1318949 we are renegotiating the price with lng buyers from china and south korea we want a better price from what we have now we want to change the pricing formula
1318950 if we cannot agree on a new price then we might delay delivery from tangguh if needed we are willing to pay a penalty until a new price has been agreed
1318951 theres very little in his music thats instantly catchy and fun anymore because hes no longer just making soundtracks hes painting soundscapes
1318952 i didnt tell father that u were in cinema theatre
1318953 the negatives were clearly a factor of making the movie adapt to the mainstream
1318954 but hey that is something we have learnt to live with
1318955 i have always reacted negatively to those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others lives

1319030 i am delighted that we have reached agreements with sky sports and five which demonstrates their commitment to cricket in england and wales
1319031 we held extensive talks with all broadcasters and were determined to be as flexible as possible in terms of our packaging and scheduling to allow the maximum number of bids for cricket from all areas of the broadcast industry
1319032 the ecb recognise and are grateful for sky sports loyalty to the sport both at home and when the england team tour overseas
1319033 we are also grateful for their investment and commitment to the english premier league twenty20 competition which will begin in june 2010 and was agreed by the ecb board at their july meeting
1319034 the ecb has also been delighted that five share our vision of highlights being screened in the early evening slot to allow as many families and young viewers to watch international cricket
1319035 i am also delighted that s4c will be able to show glamorgan matches with commentary in the welsh language and welcome their support for the welsh village cup which they will also show
1319036 i would like to thank clive leach david collier and john perera for their hard work during the itt process and for delivering television contracts which will allow the ecb to continue their considerable investment in grassroots cricket
1319037 during the last four years the board has been able to make unprecedented investment in cricket at all levels and the added value of the new deal will enable the ecb to continue that policy of investment which will benefit players from the playground to test arena and spectators alike
1319038 in this process the ecb took into consideration the culture media and sport select committee findings in 2005 and made a concerted and determined effort to ensure that there was an opportunity for all to bid for all or any part of the 35 packages available
1319039 we had countless meetings with broadcasters and i am convinced that we now have achieved the best deal available to cricket from those companies who expressed an interest in the rights
1319040 in all our discussions with the ecb we have been pleased to hear their 100 per cent commitment to test cricket at a time when the game is experiencing so many changes worldwide
1319041 it was also made clear to us at the outset of talks that the ecb would encourage competition for individual test series or one off test matches
1319042 sky has ended up with all the test matches in each year of this new deal and we shall work with the ecb to give test cricket the support it deserves
1319043 we look forward to many more days of the type of tense and fiercely competitive test cricket we enjoyed at edgbaston on saturday
1319044 there will be new competitions of course and we are delighted that they too will be seen live on sky sports we firmly believe in this country there is interest and demand among cricket fans of all ages for all forms of the game
1319045 we shall continue to offer hd coverage of all games and to invest in new technology as it is developed
1319046 i think everyone in the game accepts that there is more experience quality and variety in our various commentary teams than any broadcaster has ever assembled at any time in the past and we shall continue to develop programming which we hope will appeal to all
1319047 more and more young people have come to the game as players and spectators over the past couple of years and we shall be working with the ecb to maintain this trend
1319048 we are absolutely delighted to have renewed our contract with the ecb for another four years as cricket enters an exciting new era
1319049 our commitment to showing exclusive free to air highlights of englands test matches and one day internationals in peak time together with the high quality of our programmes produced by sunset vine has been the key to the success of our coverage
1319050 and in mark nicholas geoffrey boycott and simon hughes along with barry richards this summer we have a commentary team second to none
1319051 test match cricket has consistently delivered excellent audiences in the 7 15pm slot men in the abc1 social economic group as well as a family audience which has been very well received by advertisers
1319052 we look forward to continuing our excellent working relationship with the ecb and to a successful period for the england team
1319053 s4c is delighted at the prospect of showing live cricket in the welsh language

1319079 rahman is one for most of his numbers are indifferently visualised and a similar indifference is evident in their placement in the narrative after this movie we shouldnt complain that he keeps running off to bollywood because if hes going to compose an exquisite mood song like new york nagaram and if hes going to see its misty melancholy sapped away by cheesy visuals of surya preening around in a series of snazzy jackets and sunglasses why would he want to do good work here anymore
1319080 because if hes going to compose an exquisite mood song like new york nagaram and if hes going to see its misty melancholy sapped away by cheesy visuals of surya preening around in a series of snazzy jackets and sunglasse
1319081 anyways i wonder if theres much to inspire arr in tamil cinema unlike hindi cinema tamil cinema is mostly standard romances and action films these couldnt possibly be as inspiring as films like lagaan swades rdb and meenaxi

1319085 were hoping we can get the business done today in time for him to play tonight
1319086 it would be a big signing he played for us in pre season but with his background at arsenal and qpr we didnt think it possible that he would come to us he moved on to our friends up the road st mirren for a trial but for whatever reasons that hasnt worked out
1319087 our reports on him have been very very good hopefully well have him in time to play tonight
1319088 allan trained on monday and he should be available ryan harding was on the bench on saturday and he too is available
1319089 we are keen to move on we looked at why we lost the goal not just what role the officials played
1319090 we can now use this cup tie as a platform for a very big game against st johnstone on saturday they are the front runners but a lot of teams have been making noises about what they are going to do
1319091 we are not making any bold brash statements we are confident as a group we know we have to improve our home form in particular and make cappielow the fortress it once was
1319092 the abc loan has been of great concern to qpr fans and has been a noose around the neck of this club for far too long
1319093 i am delighted that we have now made arrangements to put this saga to an end
1319094 building for the future is what is important to me and the rest of the qpr board however with certain issues it is always necessary to deal with elements from the past and today we have done this
1319095 this once again highlights our commitment to this football club and now i am looking forward to working on the continued growth of queens park rangers both as a club and as a brand
1319096 its not just difficult to catch don its impossible old underworld saying
1319097 oh look how theyve done this scene oh look how theyve done that one
1319098 its got a great plot and its got great songs but lets lose the butterfly bow ties and the green checked suits with lapels that stretch all the way to the sleeves and lets set the whole thing in kuala lumpur with kick ass special effects lets add layers to the iftikhar character with a more intense boman irani because that guy can play practically anything and lets also lose the oldies like helen and pran and bring in buff good lookers like kareena kapoor and arjun rampal
1319099 that isnt how bachchan did this this isnt how bachchan did that

1319102 you really havent reviewed the new don at all your fixation with the old one shows that
1319103 the new one didnt engage me in a way that made me forget the old one
1319104 the best movies make for repeated viewing but this will lead to second time viewers gnashing their teeth in frustration
1319105 youre just trying to make up for the mess you made of the kank review
1319106 and he grimaces so hard u would think he is danger of hurting himself
1319107 that scene when preity comes across hrithik standing and staring at a distance and hrithik grimaces so hard u would think he is danger of hurting himself
1319108 not that i am saying that these scenes arent required in a war movie just that farhan is not possibly the best person to be doing it
1319109 actor was good songs were ok actress wasnt so good overall can watch
1319110 look im taking these elements from the old movie and even though they have no reason to be in this new one im just putting them there so that i can cash in on those memories
1319111 i think it shows that when you grow up with and become attached to a particular thing it colours the way you look at newer adaptations of it
1319112 eric steele was my goal keeping coach when i was a player at manchester city and it soon became evident that after just a couple of training sessions that eric was a unique and talented coach
1319113 play is precisely a breaking off from labour and a recuperation for labour
1319114 why should others be denied the chance to remedy their deficiency
1319115 after studying the scheduled of real madrid and the dutch team i realized that looking at the required physical effort to perform well at that level a choice had to be made
1319116 the combination of the league cup and champions league matches of real madrid on one hand and the schedule of the dutch team on the other is too heavy for me
1319117 it leaves me with no other choice of course you dont easily make such decisions i had a really good european championship with oranje and i look back with a good feeling
1319118 i had a long talk with ruud and the only thing i can and want to do is respect his decision of course its a shame that i cant use his qualities and international experience i hope that ruud will do great at real madrid

1319123 will then purchase the remaining interest from bertelsmann for approximately 600 million as a result bertelsmann will receive approximately 900 million in value for its 50 percent stake plus 300 million of its share of cash on sony bmgs balance sheet
1319124 this move is consistent with our new growth strategy and will enable us to focus on our defined growth areas
1319125 sony has been an excellent partner and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential
1319126 although market conditions in the homebuilding industry remain challenging we continue to focus on reducing our inventory and generating cash flow from operations

1319130 away from home our fans are fantastic but at home they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches and they dont realise whats going on out on the pitch
1319131 i love it when the team scores the lads are always giving me stick because of it but im just so happy i cant help it
1319132 ill never change my game it isnt possible if i did i would be half the player that i am
1319133 patrick vieira is 6 foot 4 and he starts having a go at gary neville so i said come on have a go at me simple as that hes trying to intimidate my players and im not having any of it

1319135 most suitable for a small site or for a large e commerce web site
1319136 yes this is something i do right whatever other flaws i may have as a parent our family will know this one important thing
1319137 i guess jerry yang didnt come out of the meeting as unscathed as it seemed
1319138 we were surprised at the very high vote counts that were pro jerry yang
1319139 certainly the final results seemed very different from the exit polls

1319141 since then yahoo has made significant strides in executing on its strategy performing particularly well in light of the challenging circumstances of the past six months
1319142 we are at a unique point in our history where we have the eyes of the world focused on our company and tracking our performance
1319143 something that does not enhance the lesson is not appropriate extra credit

1319151 we were expecting to see a slowdown in consumer it spending in the first half of 2008 but this has not been the case
1319152 consumers have continued to spend their disposable income on it hardware and software

1319164 truthfully i havent even read all the books ive written
1319165 some of his books wouldnt be put to shame next to certain foreign books that occupy the bestseller lists
1319166 the plot has to be dictated by the taste of the readers and by the necessity of the market
1319167 the important thing is to abandon inertia even if it means walking sideways like a crab

1319175 the fault dear brutus lies not in our stars but in ourselves
1319176 how much does one person have to earn before we say enough take the profit out of the misery of the many for the benefit of the few support our small mom and pop businesses and say no to the national chains
1319177 perhaps i couldnt believe i could pass a test i hadnt studied for
1319178 that intricate detail on the side of the building it had to be of historical significance
1319179 it might come down like a house of cards when we try to save it

1319185 gt village administrator fred ricci left and mayor jason koon stand by the historic markerin front of the eyer building on monday east rochester is going to move its offices into the building
1319186 since the november election we met with them two or three times to discuss possibilities of what we would do with the eyer building its a very historic building in the village im learning more about it every day
1319187 anything that makes sense as a pedestrian walk up kind of business
1319188 its my guess the village residents will appreciate what were doing and theyll appreciate it even more if they dont see any increases in their taxes
1319189 you never make it hard on yourself by doing something you cant afford you have too look at government the same way
1319190 we do want a building that has meaning to us the eyer building is only a piece of it were going back home with village operations which kind of says maybe we shouldnt have left in the first place

1319194 we were thinking of taking the kids down to washington
1319195 were not going to do the long trips this summer
1319196 we went to darien lake once this summer we usually go a couple times
1319197 people do want to travel but as long as gas costs continue to be this high they do not have a choice they must cut back on longer distance travel
1319198 the loss of confidence even if not originally justified by fundamentals will tend to be self confirming if the loss of confidence becomes more general a broader crisis may ensue
1319199 i continue to have confidence in the underlying strength of the global economy
1319200 failure to pass even this minimal measure would undermine confidence
1319201 people deal with money substitutes as if they were money because they are fully confident that it will be possible to exchange them at any time without delay and without cost against money we may call those who share in this confidence and are therefore ready to deal with money substitutes as if they were money the clients of the issuing banker bank or authority
1319202 it must not increase the amount of fiduciary media at such a rate and with such speed that the clients get the conviction that the rise in prices will continue endlessly at an accelerated pace for if the public believes that this is the case they will reduce their cash holdings flee into real values and bring about the crack up boom it is impossible to imagine the approach of this catastrophe without assuming that its first manifestation consists in the evanescence of confidence
1319203 it is extremely difficult for our contemporaries to conceive of the conditions of free banking because they take government interference with banking for granted and as necessary
1319204 today even the most bigoted tatists cannot deny that all the alleged evils of free banking count little when compared with the disastrous effects of the tremendous inflations which the privileged and government controlled banks have brought about
1319205 the establishment of free banking was never seriously considered precisely because it would have been too efficient in restricting credit expansion
1319206 free banking is the only method available for the prevention of the dangers inherent in credit expansion

1319214 you would notice that their job postings in jobstreet and other sites are always prominent preciese because they are always looking for new people to hire because they receive a constant stream of resignations and honestly even their wages and benefits are not that impressive to tempt someone to stay with them amidst all these problems and shortcomings
1319215 if you didnt know him already how would you recommend getting access to bill if your business was selling it products and services

1319217 what would you do when you received that phone call from your ceo telling you to work with dave

1319328 ricordo che il nuovo centro di accoglienza per gli immigrati clandestini non lo voleva nessuno ricordo che per due giorni lisola si ferm cera chi protestava con le catene e chi invece come me si limitava a far parte della massa di scioperanti oggi chi si incatenava al senato della repubblica e siede sugli scranni del potere e oggi comprendo male il significato degli scioperi che continua a fare la nostra senatrice a bordo di una barchetta al centro del porto quando le basterebbe lavorare al senato per tentare di risolvere i nostri problemi questioni di scelte intanto il nuovo centro di accoglienza stato aperto con il consenso di tutti compreso il mio e di quanti allepoca hanno protestato un consenso generale che ha visto lindifferenza di tutti i politici di ieri e di oggi del sud e del nord comunque questa nostra amministrazione qualche obiettivo lo ha raggiunto l emodialisi a lampedusa oramai una realt e presto avremo anche una t a c e non abbiamo bisogno di chiederla al maestro baglioni lopposizione secondo me sta vigilando attentamente il nostro operato ed in maniera ineccepibile si oppone quando giusto ma riesce anche a diventare propositiva appoggiando le cause che reputa giuste rimanendo sempre nei ruoli che la cittadinanza con il voto ha voluto dare loro provo tanta rabbia nel vedere milioni di euro buttati al vento per interventi discutibili e senza programmazione le nostre isole avrebbero bisogno di un ollegamento veloce via mare ma la siremar le navi le ha ferme per mancanza di fondi quello che non comprendo perch mai si preferisce utilizzare aerei a costi altissimi quando basterebbe prevedere l utilizzo di navi veloci per il collegamento di noi lampedusani e dei nostri turisti e per gli immigrati la nave palladio che comoda e sufficiente per portare migliaia di immigrati al giorno in fondo solamente una questione di volont politica e di organizzazione claudio baglioni un mito per le nostre isole un raggio di sole nel mare tempestoso dei nostri vecchi problemi claudio fa che il vento di o sci soffi sempre a lampedusa

1319342 im so glad we can now spend the rest of the day together
1319343 ram n bitte erkl re uns doch was die telemetrie alles kann was kann man damit messen wie lange gibt es telemetrie schon was haben die leute gemacht bevor sie eingef hrt wurde
1319344 telemetrie basiert auf einer reihe von sensoren am motorrad die uns alles sagen was passiert dies generiert eine kurve die es uns erlaubt das was gerade passiert einzusehen alle daten sind synchronisiert sodass wir verstehen k nnen warum gewisse dinge passieren zum beispiel kann man sehen wenn die gabel beim bremsen zu sehr einsinkt wie weit sie sinkt daraus kann man dann schl sse ziehen
1319345 praktisch alles wird gemessen es gibt zwei gro e gruppen ein system misst alles was mit dem motor zu tun hat ein anderes misst parameter des chassis der motorenbereich misst die z ndung den ldruck temperatur drehzahlen praktisch alles es gibt vier zylinder und jeder funktioniert unabh ngig daher wird jeder zylinder separat analysiert was das chassis angeht so werden bewegung der radaufh ngungen bremsdruck geschwindigkeit der r der richtung und schr glage des motorrads gemessen wir analysieren nicht immer alles vor allem aus sicherheitsgr nden
1319346 erkennen nicht aber man sieht schon unterschiede man schaut sich einen grafen an und es ist unm glich zu sagen dass dies so und dies so ist wenn man aber zwei grafen vor sich hat dann wei man mehr oder weniger welcher zu welchem fahrer geh rt weil wir ja ihre fahrstile kennen
1319347 nachdem er mit der 990er weltmeister wurde hat nicky hayden mit der 800er schwierigkeiten inwiefern hat ihn die umstellung getroffen
1319348 nicky ist ein sehr aggressiver fahrer mit seinem stil neigt das motorrad zum rutschen als wir noch mehr power hatten und der einfluss der elektronik geringer war war alles in ordnung aber jetzt mit 800 ccm haben wir weniger leistung und mehr elektronische kontrollen f r ihn ist es sehr schwierig sich auf ein anderes motorrad einzustellen fast alle topfahrer kamen aus der 250er klasse und ich glaube dass das heutzutage der einfachere weg ist nicky ist nie eine 250er maschine gefahren sondern er war schon immer in motogp und davor bei den superbikes ihn hat die umstellung mehr als jeden anderen fahrer getroffen und er stellt sich immer noch darauf ein mit dem neuen motor scheint es als w rde ihm das motorrad etwas besser liegen ich denke damit wird er selbstvertrauen tanken und wieder zu den topfahrern aufschlie en
1319349 glaubst du dass die 250er klasse heute eine bessere motogp schule ist als eine viertaktklasse
1319350 es ist keine bessere schule die wahrheit ist dass die meisten fahrer die in die motogp aufsteigen aus der 250er klasse kommen daher sind die motogp motorr der hnlich dem was sie kennen diejenigen die die motorr der entwickeln kommen auch aus der 250er klasse daher haben die motorr der zumeist hnliche features wenn die fahrer aus der superbike wm kommen oder aus der ama meisterschaft dann w ren die motogp bikes sicher anders
1319351 there is a fundamental physics issue we can no longer get around

1319357 why his jumps and dives with feet curled and body perfectly poised appealed he kept goal on his toes like a coiled spring always ready to pounce
1319358 my confidence in goal the way i seemed to be able to catch a ball easily and my technique for taming shots i put down to barba luka
1319359 it was a simple drill we did in practice he made me catch a small ball about the size of a baseball and after that it was very easy for me to catch a football
1319360 we scored an own goal after eight minutes and then had 10 great chances but ended up losing 2 0
1319361 if the game against the ussr was our most dramatic this was our unluckiest
1319362 at the time the president of the fa was rato dugonjic a senior politician who headed the department of youth
1319363 we were promised that if we got through the group wed each get a vespa which at the time cost 100 in italy but then on the day of the germany game dugonjic came and said there were no scooters and that it wasnt good for us to play like the bourgeoisie when other people had to work just to buy food suddenly we were public enemy no1 and we hadnt even asked for anything so after that we were depressed
1319364 somehow it always seemed easier when i could look at a player eye to eye
1319365 my time was the time of romantic football there were still lots of good moves dribbles and attractive goals tactics still hadnt eaten football it was the playing style of the 1962 world cup and then in england in 1966 that started the new era of football when the ball was no longer the most important thing in the game
1319366 still has to be a lot like he was in my time he has to have courage and self confidence

1319368 we are extremely happy and excited that qvc has selected us after doing an extensive survey of the market like us qvc has a unique selling proposition to its customers and is a unique business in itself we look forward to a long and lasting relationship with them

1319370 qvc realty is determined to provide the best home buying experience and we are confident that in4suite will be an important tool in enabling us to do so
1319371 the slowdown will also aid the process of weeding out some of the weaker entities within the sector and increasing the relative strength of some of the larger more established developers
1319372 the sharp increase in construction costs driven by increased steel and cement costs could also impact margins and hence liquidity the fitch analysts said
1319373 he risk would be higher for real estate companies with a limited track record and limited cushion for debt financing
1319374 it is no secret that the real estate market will soon permit low entry costs and high returns after the current property cycle is completed developers are responding to the demand
1319375 there is no difference between then and now its the same number of nris then and now india is still the flavour of the day and continues to evoke interest among people
1319376 there is no special scheme for nris participation in sales campaign and exhibitions is on like before nris from middle east uk usa and canada are actively looking at the indian real estate market

1319381 the problem with obamas position on energy is that he doesnt have a vision

1319398 displayed extraordinary effort and showed a firm commitment to lead the team which will be responsible for attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy
1319399 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media
1319400 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from the cia ever involved in any such effort
1319401 the cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous

1319439 a job worth doing is a job worth doing right
1319440 under republican and democratic administrations we failed to guard against practices that all too often rewarded financial manipulation instead of productivity and sound business practices
1319441 we let the special interests put their thumbs on the economic scales the result has been a distorted market that creates bubbles instead of steady sustainable growth a market that favors wall street over main street but ends up hurting both
1319442 our free market was never meant to be a free license to take whatever you can get however you can get it
1319443 that is why we have put in place rules of the road to make competition fair and open and honest we have done this not to stifle but rather to advance prosperity and liberty
1319444 the brazilian army does not serve the government but rather the brazilian state
1319445 the question here is much bigger than the state of roraima its a question of national integration
1319446 not just on the part of indians but from land grabbers prospectors and loggers who would take it as a signal that reservations could be invaded
1319447 if they decide against us it would be the worst thing that can happen to indigenous people across brazil
1319448 those people the settlers think their contribution to the economy and their control of the local institutions make them right

1319451 any discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race religion politics gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the olympic movement
1319452 but in the years now months run up to the olympics the reality has been numbingly disappointing
1319453 i suppose it was just a bunch of words when they made those promises
1319454 when the chinese government is serious about something they do it
1319455 china is a responsible country we will fulfill the promises we made for the olympics
1319456 the ideas out there that china made commitments on human rights but its simply not true
1319457 nobody was in any mood to make any promises then
1319458 the fact that virginia is even up for grabs tells you a lot
1319459 if you had told me four years ago that a democratic presidential candidate would be running a competitive race in virginia and would open 10 offices i would say that is spectacular
1319460 now we have a guy who has opened 20 to 30 offices around the state youve got to be kidding me
1319461 we have traditionally been the party who can get their people to the polls when its a presidential race
1319462 even in 1996 when bill clinton was winning every state imaginable bob dole won virginia because our people showed up
1319463 for a race thats going to be as close as this is it will take a lot of pieces of the puzzle for us to add to be successful
1319464 we are doing exactly what republican campaigns have done in the past
1319465 all they have to do is add water every four years
1319466 weve got to get to a level of organization that really hasnt been done before here
1319467 it is no doubt they are going to register anything that can walk talk and chew gum at the same time so that will give them an advantage
1319468 anyone who they have registered they will then go grab them by the back of the scruff and take them out to vote
1319469 i would say eight in 10 doors we go to are either strong self identified democrats who are for obama or frustrated moderate republicans who dont believe mccain represents change from bush
1319470 if youre a military family you might just want to support the one who is going to bring your families home
1319471 this is a unique situation where there is both an up ticket effect and a down ticket effect
1319472 the obama effort on turnout is going to have a positive effect that will help mark and i also think mark will perform so well and organize so strongly in some traditionally republican parts of the state that that will help obama
1319473 i suspect most virginians kind of like the notion that a virginian can be in key leadership nationally
1319474 how that translates into any effect on election day i dont know

1319479 these waste pickers are providing a public service for free
1319480 we had managed to stop half a dozen of these dubious projects in the past
1319481 but this time around in the name of carbon credits fraudulent claims are being made with impunity
1319482 it tends to be too wet containing too much ash and sand and noncombustible inert materials
1319483 i know what happens to incinerator ash most of it ends up by the side of the road there are no engineered landfills in india fly ash and bottom ash is required to be managed very carefully in most countries but in india they simply do not have the infrastructure to do that
1319484 when waste pickers are denied access to the waste stream they go through the ash looking for metal the only substance to survive incineration intact
1319485 ive seen people thigh deep picking through incinerator ash for metals youre using the human body as a toxic basically spoon feeding it to these people
1319486 they are effectively denying a livelihood to the poorest of the poor in setting up this incinerator
1319487 to take that miserable existence away its criminal and now were seeing skyrocketing food prices what will these people do huge local skills in recycling are now being wiped out skills essential for a sustainable society
1319488 so do all the other splendid buildings in washington d c for you are a citizen of the united states
1319489 well have very cautious limited wars between the big players and bloody messes
1319490 theyre the best soldiers weve got just check the casualty lists from iraq they read like the time sheet at your local burrito shack
1319491 too often american war discussions why we lost in vietnam why were losing in iraq become tactical and moral jungles
1319492 if they choose a placename it is quite easy to remember if it was just a number that might get confused i havent come across where midori is from i would have guessed it was the japanese connection
1319493 no secret deal or accommodation kept us out of the city
1319494 as 90 percent of the attacks were against us we thought if we moved out we would remove the source of the problem
1319495 but actually the jaish al mahdi the mahdi army had been fighting us because we were the only obstacle to their total control
1319496 there was no structure in place in the city for units to go back in and start mentoring the iraqi troops
1319497 when the action was launched british forces provided a raft of military support including armor artillery airpower medical and logistic support
1319498 what happened in basra nasiriyah amarah and other areas falls on the shoulders of the british forces
1319499 basra is considered the economic capital of iraq but the british let the militias do what they wanted
1319500 he has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but he is in good spirits
1319501 he is going to have surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to correct the damage he says hell be okay and is looking forward to a full recovery
1319502 texas is not bound by the world court but by the us supreme court which reviewed this matter and determined that the convicted murderers execution shall proceed
1319503 it couldnt come at a worse time and it seems to me that the bbc is insensitive or completely disregards the impact of its plans on the commercial media in the regions
1319504 we have our own video journalists but they have to do other jobs as well we cant afford to employ dedicated video journalists the bbc can because of its level of funding
1319505 the bbc in terms of local video based reporting is behind most regional publications at the moment but it wont take them long to catch up
1319506 people are very well served theres no need for the bbc to do video we are saying it will significantly harm the revenues and profitability of regional press
1319507 it has used its massive public funding and resources brand potency unrivalled distribution network and cross promotional opportunities to become the most powerful media brand in the world and the leading uk player in television radio and on the internet now it is seeking to extend that market leadership into the provision of local news and information
1319508 northcliffes journalists have been providing video news for up to two and a half years at least 50 of northcliffes websites will carry truly local video content by september 2008 when a rollout of the companys next generation internet publishing platform is complete in june 62 000 video views were recorded across northcliffes this is network of websites
1319509 ah what the heck lets mix it up a bit
1319510 the fed is really locked in right now they cant go forward or backward
1319511 we cannot and will not allow a wage price spiral to develop
1319512 reminder that the man for whom your city is named encouraged his followers to be patient and forgiving we look forward to seeing you next month
1319513 its the bastard child of everything weve been striving towards over the 15 20 years that realtime worlds dma and david jones have been making games
1319514 its where we want to go in terms of sandbox gameplay and everything that started with grand theft auto and was evolving through crackdown
1319515 to distribute those shoes to needy kids in lima peru
1319516 it was a very successful trip i am really proud of our kids and what we were able to accomplish it was something that will change our lives forever were going to do this every year i will continue to do this this will be something i will do the rest of my life
1319517 they told us to get out and down to the concourse because of bad weather seen a lot of games here never heard that before then you heard that boomer go off across the street

1319519 so we see a lot of investments to raise the bar and attract new customers and hopefully create a much better neighborhood
1319520 there is a lot of energies going on the north side of indianapolis and we saw a good opportunity with the vacant land and some of the larger parcels that can be combined into making a pretty exciting mixed use community
1319521 right now we feel like apartments are hot downtown for people looking to live downtown and were really trying to capture a young professional someone early on in their career or just those folks who just want to be close to downtown without the baggage of owning
1319522 so we hope to see a lot of people making that decision to move downtown and enjoy the great urban living we have here

1319533 hes a fantastic player and an important player for us
1319534 i hope he can score a lot of goals for liverpool and that i can play alongside him many times
1319535 weve only been training together for a few days so its not a lot of time but the important thing for me is that he is always talking during games
1319536 the understanding between us and steven gerrard is important as well he is the midfielder who is passing the ball to myself and robbie and so the more training we do together the more good things we can do for liverpool
1319537 it was perfect to score my first goal because thats always important for strikers ive only been training for one week and so its understandable to feel tired
1319538 the idea is to arrive fit and ready for the start of the premier league season phughes699
1319539 having studied in detail the programmes of real madrid and the dutch eleven i realised that given the physical effort required to perform at my maximum i was going to have to make a choice
1319540 the combination of the competition cup and champions league games of real madrid and the programme of the dutch team is too heavy a burden
1319541 obviously such a decision is not something one takes in a night i have experienced a great euro 2008 with the orange team and i look back on it with fondness
1319542 of course i find it a pity that i wont be able to call on his quality and international experience in putting teams together in the future
1319543 to meet the new standards well in advance of 2020
1319544 the industry has made a commitment to step forward and support these aggressive standards
1319545 i think we are going to be able to satisfy those requirements
1319546 theyre playing the same old game of insisting they cant do it even though reality is hitting them in the face

1319554 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
1319555 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal

1319558 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
1319559 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
1319560 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
1319561 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
1319562 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
1319563 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that

1319578 some targets get pretty close and then disappear we continue to get closer to the finish line with other targets
1319579 yes i would like a few more bodies in but they have to be of the right quality if you cant get the right quality you just have to keep going
1319580 i would hope there will be a few more coming in before the season starts sometimes the expectations from players advisors are way beyond where we can go and thats fine by me
1319581 weve got a wage structure and the players all understand that its a philosophy i try to have and it wont be broken
1319582 as far as were concerned weve agreed everything that we can over marlon king
1319583 its a three way situation in the transfer one between us and wigan two between us and the player and finally between the player and wigan
1319584 two of those aspects have been agreed but its down to what happens between the player and wigan now the agent has put wigan in a very difficult position
1319585 im beginning to get the impression that the move might be driven by money more than ambition
1319586 i have been playing in england for the last four years and i think that every year i have improved including the last 12 months at chelsea

1319592 the sentiment is more bearish now than before as concern over slower u s economic growth is weighing on demand
1319593 the last commodity sell off of this magnitude in march 1980 unfortunately did little to the severe 1980 and 1981 1982 recessions
1319594 nonetheless this commodity sell off may help corral the disconcerting inflation pulse of the past year and eventually allow central banks the luxury of again easing to help stimulate economic activity
1319595 the tug of war between upside risks to inflation and downside risks to growth will persist in the coming quarters in our opinion the growth outlook will remain too troublesome to allow the fomc to hike interest rates anytime soon
1319596 the mention in the last statement that downside growth risks appeared to have diminished somewhat now looks like a premature conclusion
1319597 the extension and enhancement of the liquidity facilities suggests the fed remains concerned about financial stability and thus is unlikely to raise rates in the near term
1319598 with oil and commodity prices not growing nearly as rapidly as earlier this year headline inflation rates are set to moderate by the end of the year
1319599 is likely to continue with hawkish rhetoric reiterating their vigilance against inflation but also noting that their expectation that slack in the economy should help mitigate inflationary pressures over several quarters
1319600 were pretty well positioned for the downside risks we might encounter from here
1319601 i worry a little bit more about the prospects for inflation
1319602 probably to about 100 within the next month if you keep on getting weak demand data
1319603 it seems that the market is losing interest in geopolitical and weather induced props and instead is becoming more aware of growing supply demand imbalances
1319604 investors are quite concerned they are looking at smaller economic growth and that demand for commodities will go lower

1319673 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
1319674 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees

1319697 wir h rten dass mark ronson interessiert war uns zu produzieren und wir hatten drei neue songs die wir aufnehmen wollten diese ersten wochen im februar waren so produktiv und am sant dass wir ziemlich schnell mehr songs hatten und weiter machten es war zu beginn gar nicht unsere absicht ein album aufzunehmen in wahrheit wollten wir uns ein jahr frei nehmen
1319698 any time youve got a veteran quarterback that gives you a great chance
1319699 former pro bowl linebacker levon kirkland was on that team every time i talk to him he always brings it up he says it in a joking way but i feel like he says it just because he believes we have what it takes to do it again everybody believes that we can do it i feel like we will do it
1319700 we were so close but at the same time we know going into this season we dont have to change anything its not like we have to change our philosophy we dont have to fire a coach or hire a coach we dont need new players we just need to go out and make the plays were capable of making
1319701 the past couple of years for some reason theres been this expectation that clemson should be at the top when im not exactly sure we deserved it
1319702 this year weve got everybody coming back i feel like our senior leadership is strong theres the skill level we have at the skill positions the guys we have coming back on defense
1319703 honestly this is the first year weve really had what it takes to be considered an acc championship caliber team
1319704 the last two years we had a little bit of negative attitudes people werent doing what they were supposed to do some workouts were voluntary and we had guys who wouldnt show up now we have 100 percent attendance
1319705 the way it worked out i really didnt have much of a choice to go to georgia
1319706 it wasnt going to work out harper said even though harper never went to georgia his family ties to the school could remain in perpetuity georgia is about to unveil a campus statue honoring former coach vince dooley the 14 foot bronze sculpture will feature jeff harper and georgia teammate tim morrison holding dooley aloft during the bulldogs 1980 national championship season the harpers dont represent the only georgia clemson family connection clemsons roster this season features a freshman quarterback named mark richt so much is expected of clemson this season that bowden already has heard questions about whether anything less than a conference title would make this season a failure bowden responded by citing georgia which finished the 2007 season second in the associated press poll despite failing to reach the sec championship game mark richt sees his season last year as a failure
1319707 he didnt win the conference championship he didnt play for it hes still employed though is it a failure if we win 10 games and dont go to the championship game ten games is a lot of wins
1319708 six seven or eight wins is really never acceptable to me
1319709 weve had them but im surely not satisfied with them i know that myself the players the coaches administration and fans nobodys ever been satisfied with those id hate to coach at a place where there was satisfaction with those
1319710 if we dont make it to the acc championship i think weve let some people down harper said
1319711 he just reminds me week in and week out to stay focused
1319712 youve got to deal with adversity its going to be a long and tough season sometimes things arent going to go your way its how you react in those situations that counts
1319713 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
1319714 we hope that the results of this survey will allow us to work with the congolese government to establish and protect the new ntokou pikounda protected area
1319715 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1319716 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working
1319717 its really doubly special because im standing here on the great wall and watching it

1319723 when you go to most chain restaurants ordering off the kids menu is a nightmare
1319724 right now kids meals are almost all unhealthy meals when they should be almost all healthy meals
1319725 at the very least restaurants should list calories on the menu so that parents can navigate through this minefield of calories and fat to find the healthy options
1319726 eating out is no longer a special occasion its a lifestyle now so we have to be more selective about what we eat
1319727 this is a wakeup call that parents need to take advantage of restaurants healthier options especially if kids are going to be eating out three or more times a week most kids dont clean their plates so they are probably not eating all these calories
1319728 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy 7 months is perfectly safe without adverse effects
1319729 our review of the literature convinces us that more aggressive and earlier intervention will probably prevent considerably more than 30 percent of coronary heart disease

1319731 how the hell are some of these girls so flexible
1319732 the institute for advanced learning and research is excited to offer these professional development experiences for our area teachers it is critical that our students have early and consistent exposure to emerging science and technology fields if they are to be competitive in the 21st century knowledge based economy
1319733 nanotechnology is an emerging science that offers great promise such as the work being done at luna in danville
1319734 i am glad that i was able to help secure this grant for the institute for advanced learning and research so that teachers in the danville area can become best practice experts in the field of nanotechnology and prepare their students for the possibility of pursuing careers in this area of the 21st century economy
1319735 i dont know it doesnt matter to me not everything must be translated into and cents some things are done out of passion eg helping with language evaluation at toastmasters clubs etc

1319739 we have asked to interview her twice and it has not happened
1319740 mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1319741 a carefully fenced highly cultivated garden with neat borders and delicate flowers but no glance of a bright physiognomy no open country no fresh air no blue hill no bonny beck i should hardly like to live with her ladies and gentlemen in their elegant but confined house
1319742 what throbs fast and full though hidden what the blood rushes through what is the unseen seat of life and the sentient target of death this miss austen ignores jane austen was a complete and most sensible lady but a very incomplete woman
1319743 where does this deep melancholy come from that i feel seizes me as i enter this city is it not proof that some great evil will happen to me
1319744 its a nun taking the veil in one of the convents in the middle of the sea its our way that at the moment the women pronounce their religious vows they throw behind them a bouquet of flowers that they carried during the ceremony its the sign of renouncing the world
1319745 twilight had passed into night and the lamps were lit in the streets ere i issued from the sombre church to turn back was now become possible to me the wild longing to breathe this october wind on the little hill far without the city walls had ceased to be an imperative impulse and i turned as i thought to the rue fossette but i had become involved in a part of the city with which i was not familiar it was the old part and full of narrow streets of picturesque ancient and mouldering houses i was much too weak to be very collected and i was too careless of my own welfare and safety to be cautious i grew embarrassed i got enmeshed in a net work of turns unknown i was lost and had no resolution to ask guidance of any passenger
1319746 he has lived in that house more than twenty years and poor man is so totally deaf that they say he could not hear a canon were it fired close to him having no canon at hand to make the experiment i took it for granted and talked to him with my fingers which was funny enough i recommended him to read corinne

1319750 my brother was almost on the site of the crash and had to run away with his cousin my mother came rushing out of the house and broke her shoes

1319752 this was 1941 when we were right at the bottom of the war and having great problems and they came to save us they came from their home country not just to get liberty for their own country but to fight for us at the worst possible time
1319753 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1319754 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1319755 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1319756 as it turns out big oils most successful speculating wasnt in the oil fields it was in washington where they invested millions in john mccain and got their moneys worth
1319757 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1319758 huge crowds and mostly favorable press reviews of obamas overseas trip have been trumped by mccains attacks on obama
1319759 loss of support for obama among young voters may also be due to his perceived reversals on issues they care about such as the war and government eavesdropping
1319760 everything can be taken from a man but one thing to choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose ones way
1319761 everything can be taken from a church but one thing to choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose ones way

1319767 the crackdown on underground churches so far this year is much more intense than the past few years put together because of the olympic games
1319768 the chinese government is concerned about any group disrupting their plans for being a perfect olympic host house churches are among the groups drawing special attention the same government that says its okay for olympic competitors and visitors to bring in and read their bibles and provides places of worship in the olympic village is cracking down on house church leaders and relocating and imprisoning some of them

1319774 every human life should be protected and the endorsements we continue to receive prove that our easy to understand amendment is one that all coloradans can support

1319782 the court is profoundly concerned about the very poor judgment which this childs parents have shown in choosing this name

1319793 if i have to choose to be blind or deaf what would i choose
1319794 it really depends on whether the person is more visual or more aural
1319795 ah youve not quite answered my question you have to make a choice my dear
1319796 i guess if i were deaf it would also imply that i would be dumb a double whammy phew i think i would prefer to have my eyes
1319797 oh dear god please keep my ears and eyes intact if i had to lose any of them please give me the same courage and contentment as hellen keller had

1319802 first priority is winning the war while letting the narcotics problem be sorted out by somebody else
1319803 where are the roots of the issue fed this time
1319804 india will claim it has legitimate interests in afghanistan and that it is a major donor in the international effort to rebuild that country pakistan will charge that india is running operations out of its many consulates in afghanistan to stir trouble across the border especially to fan the flames of the anti islamabad insurgency in balochistan pakistan sees itself as potentially caught in a vice between its western and eastern neighbours but these long standing concerns are now being trumped by a new reality the need for india and pakistan to look beyond their traditional rivalries and agree on a joint strategy to confront the extremists operating along the pakistan afghanistan border
1319805 it requires all parties to get the job done to educate the kids
1319806 it is essential that the student acquires an understanding of and a feeling for values he must acquire a vivid sense of the beautiful and the morally good otherwise he with specialized knowledge more closely resembles a well trained dog than a harmoniously developed person

1319854 flypaper studio took the market by storm last year when they presented their flagship product at the prestigious demo conference and invest southwest winning awards at both highly innovative companies with a winning management team do come out of places other than silicon valley and flypaper is the perfect example
1319855 it is super important for us to work with rest of industry to ensure interoperability

1319858 it is based on the book by david walker from the 1950s
1319859 it was immediately made into quite a famous movie with alistair sim and bill travers playing geordie as it happens the film has just been re released in a boxed set of alastair sim dvds
1319860 wherever we take it particularly in america people remember the movie it is real feel good piece and what prompted me to commission the play was that i remember seeing the film on the telly when i was younger and then i found the book and read it and thought it was a great story
1319861 it is a story where the underdog does well and achieves great things but decides that home is best and i think we can all identify with that
1319862 the version of the show we did in new york we viewed as a preliminary stage in its development it was too long and we didnt think we had the narrative quite right so a fair bit of work has been done on it since this one is leaner and tighter
1319863 i asked david and stuart to adapt it as a musical partly because we hadnt done one in a while
1319864 but also because when i read the book i felt then that it would make an ideal subject for a musical musicals tend to make people feel good and this is a real feel good story having a little highland lad growing into the olympic champion really appeals to people and just shows what you can do if you put your mind to it
1319865 ive been artistic director of syt for 16 years now and i think it keeps me young
1319866 there is nothing better for me than to see a young person grow and achieve things that they perhaps never thought they could
1319867 we give people the opportunity to shine at whatever they are best at and it is immensely satisfying to watch them develop through the rehearsal process and then to see them go out and make me proud of them on stage
1319868 most of the time people are satisfied even if they dont see dolphins
1319869 sometimes we can have a week where we go out every single day and see dolphins some weeks we will not see them at all the moray firth is a really big area of water and we can only go so far
1319870 in the past week we have probably seen dolphins about 80 per cent of the time we have been out
1319871 but it really depends the dolphins are old intelligent animals they dont come to see us at all they are not interested in tourism they come here to eat
1319872 we can take up to 50 people out on the boat
1319873 just now we are taking at least 20 people out most times
1319874 we do ask people and the cost of getting here does scare some
1319875 when people see the dolphins they grin from ear to ear it is fantastic
1319876 we want to be able to build our own cafe and also a small exhibition centre at the marina that is what we would like to do but we will have to get permission
1319877 we hope that will draw more visitors to the city
1319878 but we are not seeing as many in the kessock channel as we used to
1319879 what may happen is we may end up with no dolphins in the inner moray firth at all if we continue to harass them over fish the area and throw rubbish in the sea
1319880 if we get our act together and respect these animals we will hopefully have a long term future with them
1319881 if a bag gets wrapped around an animals head it can suffocate
1319882 we have seen birds with plastic bags wrapped around their feet when it fills with water it acts as an anchor
1319883 you can tell that by the bird activity it has been very low
1319884 he did very well as captain last season and the fact he has got a seasons experience under his belt was another big plus
1319885 he showed all the leadership qualities you require from a captain and hopefully being given the role again will act as an extra incentive for him to continue to do well
1319886 if im being honest it was a relatively straightforward decision to keep grant on as captain and i see no reason why he cant do the job as well if not better this time round
1319887 we were a bit tentative in the first half and allowed burnley to dictate but our display in the second half was very pleasing
1319888 andy barrowman scored a great goal but he had one ruled out for offside while he also rattled the post however theres no doubt thats been his best game in a caley thistle shirt so far
1319889 ive been reasonably happy with our preparations im confident we have done everything we can to be ready for the start of the new seasony
1319890 its certainly getting close to the starting line up im looking at
1319891 however i would never say at such an early stage like this if it will be my team for the aberdeen game or not
1319892 i want to bring adam here before we play aberdeen
1319893 im hopeful that something can be done but i cant say anything more until something happens as i need to see what stoke want to do
1319894 i would feel very weird if they brought her ripley back and cast someone else
1319895 i dont care whether the budget is big or small or if its a lead role or not if the storys good im there
1319896 music has been a vital and vibrant part of sonys culture for over twenty years this acquisition will allow us to achieve a deeper and more robust integration between the wide ranging global assets of the music company and sonys products operating companies and affiliates it enables us to offer a total entertainment experience to consumers
1319897 over the past four years sony bmg has undertaken a very successful restructuring streamlined operations and developed innovative digital partnerships that ensure it will continue to be a leader in the creation and distribution of music worldwide it is an organization rich in talent ideas and enthusiasm and is a strong fit with our overall business strategy
1319898 after a careful and thorough review we made the strategic decision to sell our investment in this joint venture to sony a step that we believe will benefit the stakeholders of both our companies
1319899 this move is consistent with our new growth strategy and will enable us to focus on our defined growth areas sony has been an excellent partner and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential we look forward to witnessing sony music entertainments exciting future under sonys ownership
