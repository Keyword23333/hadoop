2580023 it would be nice to have something like another parking lot downtown somewhere that may be available that we could turn into a park and ride
2580024 i wouldnt expect to drive all the way to the georgian capital that would be too much for the west to stomach
2580025 they have only a single route over the rugged caucasus range if georgian commandos interdict it the russians will feel the supply pinch quickly and any major russian military operations need to be wrapped up before autumn snows close the passes if there isnt a cease fire sooner
2580026 the only comfort is that wiz was not injured in the heinous attack
2580027 two of the most supportive and friendly people that i have ever encountered they have a genuine knack for making everyone welcome and continued their support of ucla volleyball even after wiz graduated they love the sport and are beloved in the volleyball community

2580037 as enemies to be met not with cooperation but with conquest to be subjugated and mastered
2580038 religion needs science to keep it away from superstition and keep it close to reality to protect it from creationism which turns god into a nature god and science needs religion in order to have a conscience to know that just because something is possible it may not necessarily be a good thing to do

2580042 the drive by the iranian regime to acquire nuclear weapons is a drive to achieve the power to inflict mass murder any socialist who wants them to acquire that power abandons the ground of socialism entirely and becomes a native or vicarious iranian or islamic chauvinist
2580043 irans right to have nuclear weapons is an inalienable part of their right to self determination

2580107 he was sound academically but always wanted to be a cricketer
2580108 i get great delight when he scores a hundred because i know why he left south africa which is to be measured for what hes worth and theres a lot of sportsmen disappearing in south africa because they cant be kevin has gone overseas determined to prove the system here is wrong i take my hat off to him for that
2580109 he was 18 years old and wouldnt have been in our set up if he hadnt been talented
2580110 he got into the side because he could bowl spin and offer something with the bat he was brilliant in the field but he was a schoolkid and facing guys like kenny benjamin he found tough like anyone would
2580111 what stood out in his innings against england of 61 not out for natal in 1999 was how cleanly he hit the ball shaun pollock said hed never seen a guy hit the ball so cleanly at that age he was one of the hardest working young guys in the squad but opportunities were going to be limited
2580112 at the end of the season he was offered a one year contract for not a substantial amount and he had the chance to go to england
2580113 once he made that decision he was determined to fight for everything and it made him a better player and a better person when he puts his mind to something hes excelled that sums him up really
2580114 i was led to believe he was a batter but kevin desperately wanted to bowl
2580115 he would ring me on a friday asking to bowl more overs but we had two spinners and his off spin was inconsistent he had strong ambitions there was a certain arrogance though that is not a bad thing
2580116 he did very well with the bat he didnt make massive scores but played some important innings he was a front foot player and i did wonder how hed go against real pace it was unfortunate that he left early natal were touring western australia because he missed us clinching the title that season was the pinnacle for us kevin made a lot of friends though he had difficulties with the club over money i wouldnt want to take the credit but maybe that season was when he began to think of himself chiefly as a batsman
2580117 the conditions were bowler friendly and carl greenidge bowled really well and quickly all their batsmen struggled all except one carl dropped slightly short and pietersen hooked it miles over square leg it flew out of the ground over some trees and knocked the tiles off the roof of a house it made us all sit up he played really well in difficult conditions it was clear he was one to watch
2580118 matthew hayden hadnt arrived so i was leading the side
2580119 we played notts again in a one dayer at the end of the season it was my last match at northampton as i was retiring and we had a party after the game and kevin came along i know hes not everyones cup of tea but he seemed a nice guy to me i admire his self belief and work ethic hes an excellent role model
2580120 he was playing at notts and i remember there being some debate about his long term objectives there
2580121 he had risen fast from an off spinner in natal to frontline batsman in county cricket it had been an extraordinary transformation
2580122 he liked to get across his crease and sometimes got caught on the crease lbw
2580123 shortly after he qualified we picked him for a one day series in zimbabwe and duncan fletcher the england coach was so impressed he wanted to find a way to get him on the south africa tour this happened when andrew flintoff returned home injured from the one dayers then it was like a one man show pietersen scoring hundreds on his own batting in an extraordinarily controlled way
2580124 kevin didnt get off to a great start in zimbabwe
2580125 standing at the other end watching him take balls from outside off stump and put them through midwicket was a humbling experience how do you follow that he had a good work ethic from the start and watched what the senior guys were doing he has been quoted as saying that he wants to improve every day and he means it the hostility towards him from the south african crowds was very evident but if anything that external pressure helped jump start his career
2580126 i wouldnt say easy in fact the job can only get worse
2580127 how can you decide which patient needs the respirator more than the other it is such a dilemma
2580128 there have been times when relatives realized that their patient was alive only because he or she had been strapped to the life support system and when they ran out of money they decided to take the patient home against medical advice
2580129 we practise things but dont have laws about them we seem to live in a state which seems to have overwhelming control on the way we live people say a law on euthanasia will be misused but that argument is bogus in netherlands for instance where euthanasia is allowed there has been no evidence of misuse
2580130 a solution would be to have committees drawing people from several walks of life to debate on medical dilemmas in britain for instance the national health service and clinical excellence has committees for each disease
2580131 when the medical termination of pregnancy act came into being in early seventies social norms prevailing at that time demanded that we cut down on our population religious groups opposed the move but social responsibility overrode all other claims
2580132 if mbeki has a clear conscience about the deal as he insists he does then he will appoint an independent judicial inquiry into the persistent allegations
2580133 this is not just a wilful demand from the media a judiciary inquiry has been demanded by local political parties religious leaders and anti corruption activists
2580134 there was pressure for all of us but for her it was even harder
2580135 im sorry but the chinese press is putting a lot of pressure on chinese athletes
2580136 i just didnt have any more strength in the legs
2580137 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2580138 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2580139 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2580140 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2580141 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2580142 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo

2580166 first we need to know how the mass of hell is changing in time so we need to know the rate that souls are moving into hell and the rate they are leaving i think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell it will not leave therefore no souls are leaving as for different religions that exist in the world today most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion you will go to hell since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion we can project that all souls go to hell with birth and death rates as they are we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially now we look at the rate of change of the volume in hell because boyles law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same the volume of hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added this gives two possibilities 1 if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose 2 if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over considering then the postulate presented to me by teresa k during my cold day in hell before i sleep with you
2580167 we listened to what people have said we know they are concerned and we have responded to those concerns with a comprehensive plan

2580171 i dont think there will be any continuation of discussions on the statement the positions are too far apart
2580172 the pullout of georgian troops is the most important thing
2580173 to go as soon as possible to the region to propose to the parties concerned some elements to get out of the crisis
2580174 an immediate cessation of hostilities the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia the re establishment of the situation that existed before

2580186 as an architect you are an expert in at least one thing
2580187 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2580188 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2580189 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2580190 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2580191 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2580192 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2580193 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2580194 bernie mac was a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place he was a tremendous live performer and a wonderful actor fox was proud to be the home of the bernie mac show and all of us at fox and 20th century fox television extend our deepest sympathies to his wife rhonda and daughter jeniece
2580195 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
2580196 make you laugh like that maybe you never cry again
2580197 and i say that with motivation because i remember them without any shame without any sorrow without any pity thats what made me

2580201 hoe kan dat nou dat jij zulke beroemde mensen kent en dat beatrix en major jou zomaar begroeten

2580214 reaching hampden was an incredible experience and a great achievement for the club but now weve got to try and exceed that
2580215 if we could manage to get past this hurdle and reach the group stage of the uefa cup then that would definitely do it it would also help us kick on in the league
2580216 i have two strikers who get 50 goals a season between them and if you have that why mess about and try something that might not give you the same

2580226 is it really the chief proper use of dogma and other theology to keep the essential questions alive p 92

2580231 has come in part from being the spiritual director to people of the homosexual orientation
2580232 i did come to a point where i could no longer say the biblical account answers all of the questions we have or want to ask
2580233 it is entirely compatible with the christian faith not only to love another person of the same sex but also express that love fully in a personal sexual relationship
2580234 i suspect that a fuller exploration of the sexual metaphors of the bible will have more to teach us about a theology and ethics of sexual desire than will the flat citation of isolated texts and i hope other theologians will find this worth following up more fully than i can do here
2580235 affirming catholicism has consistently called for the full inclusion of lesbian and gay members of the church
2580236 not convinced that a homosexual has to be celibate in every imaginable circumstance

2580275 every expenditure has been in the context of fighting poverty
2580276 its very important for unions not to do this kind of thing
2580277 union leadership is a public trust all the more so when the people being represented are among the lowest paid in america

2580282 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2580283 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2580284 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2580285 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2580286 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2580287 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2580288 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2580289 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2580355 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2580356 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders as articulated in numerous
2580357 calls on all parties to cease hostilities and to resume without delay so as to secure a political solution to the crisis which respects georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

2580376 the territorial integrity of georgia is currently being violated on an enormous scale
2580377 there are bombardments civilians are dying foreign military forces are on georgian territory
2580378 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe
2580379 we did not accept military intervention by milosevics serbia in other yugoslav states on the grounds of protecting serbian passport holders
2580380 the eu and nato must take the initiative and stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy in the east of europe
2580381 the russian federation has overstepped a red line in keeping the peace and stability in the conflict zone and in protecting russian citizens outside its own borders
2580382 a worsening of the crisis could affect the whole region with its negative consequences

2580388 the governors who are recalled with less than 50 percent of the vote will make it known theyre not happy very very quickly and i think if morales is not ratified by a big margin we could see a deepening of the political crisis

2580492 they talk of democracy but they just want their hands on the power
2580493 but we couldnt let dictatorship return under the guise of democracy
2580494 we didnt really like abdallahi but he was democratically elected
2580495 whats the point of having a constitution if he can be forced out like that
2580496 we have invited them to join our board we are in discussions with them and they have responded positively
2580497 let us not forget they own 49 of the exchange and have a right to express their views on the board there is absolutely no question of interference by brokers in the running of the exchange these are baseless charges
2580498 theres no point in picking the stake if we cannot drive the exchange there will be areas of conflict with another large investor coming in which will make it difficult for us to run it for instance if we want to make some key appointments and then that is challenged by a section of shareholders it will make things needlessly difficult so we have dropped that plan
2580499 regardless of whats happening to earnings the cash is still rolling in and asset prices are down
2580500 if a market goes down its more attractive than before
2580501 hes given the caution flag and people are ignoring it
2580502 for a management to be successful a very important part is you should know when to give up
2580503 it is generally very difficult to let go off power if you are looking at the welfare of the organisation you should know my role stops here and somebody elses starts who is the deserving one
2580504 the kind of initiatives which i have been able to take was all geared to see that bse becomes a meaningful competition in the capital market
2580505 where various conflicting interests had to be converged into a seamless and cohesive object
2580506 she wishes to maintain her privacy and her daughters privacy
2580507 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2580508 be happy to participate in one i know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
2580509 i wish that those involved would refrain from bad mouthing my sister
2580510 she is a good and honest person the sweetest and most caring woman one could ever hope to meet
2580511 do you think its easy for us to just sit back and let everyone rip her to shreds and not defend her honor
2580512 it could well be it looks like me i dont know who that baby is i have no idea what the picture is
2580513 i mean do you know how many pictures have been taken of me holding children in the last three years i mean it happens all the time
2580514 i think its amazing even as the mans coming clean that hes continuing to lie
2580515 just as ive been saying for 10 months that he had an affair with rielle hunter we know for a fact that is rielle hunters baby and that is him holding the baby in the beverly hilton hes not only hiding things from the public hes hiding things from his wife
2580516 we couldnt have been there at 3 in the morning if we didnt have a good pipeline into the whole situation
2580517 the wine market has grown at a rate of 30 year on year for the past three years and being a conservative guy i still expect the industry to maintain a growth of 25 30 for the next 3 decades
2580518 with increasing competition and big multinationals now making a foray into the wine markets some of the current market leaders would experience a drop in market share however this will also increase the overall growth of this sector which will be beneficial to all
2580519 while indian wine is not bad it still has to mature age and experience will help these wines get better as they are still a bit too fruity and sweet they need to improve on their texture and complexity before they can compete with the more ripe and sophisticated collectable wines
2580520 that amount which you are comfortable investing for long term capital appreciation and which you can afford to risk
2580521 there are relatively few perhaps only about 75 in total investment grade labels whose production levels remain more or less fixed
2580522 wines such as bordeaux are highly exclusive less than 1 of all the wines in the world are of investment grade finite in production quantity and often improve in quality over time the chances of a crash in investment values are minimised and the only time a wine investment would depreciate would be in a global depression
2580523 wine funds operate as public mutual funds as well as private funds we are an offshore cayman public company we made returns of 24 in 2006 25 in 2007 2008 has been flat up to now but is beginning to look better some funds have lock in periods of 5 years while others have no minimum lock in period initial investments in wine funds vary from fund to fund we have an entry barrier of 250 000 euro the prospects for wine investments in an investor portfolio and the industry growth are both looking excellent we are only at the beginning of a huge growth of interest in the very best wines especially in countries relatively new to wine such as russia korea china and india
2580524 people are looking at wine as a serious investment these days we get inquires for investment purposes regularly in fact last year we roped in 2 partners who were looking to invest in the industry ideally wine companies target hnis looking to make a long term investment many people look to investment bankers to help them make investments in wine and that is the most commonly used medium for investors looking to get into the indian wine industry
2580525 we are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars
2580526 financial astrology can help in identifying when the market is expected to go up and down technical analysis uses volume trades to predict the markets future however it is difficult to predict future volumes the movement of the 9th planet can help predict trade volumes and when a sector will have a good time or a bad one each country is governed by a planet and depending on how the planet is placed one can predict the economic conditions and currency situation of the country as well
2580527 1 3 5 and 6 are powerful numbers perhaps these numbers could be used when choosing to name a new born baby company or a brand name with cosmetic alterations in existing names too one can shift the vibrations and bring the names on powerful numbers for eg raymonds was rechristened raymond to bring it on number 24 or 6 corporate clients come to us to help them get their companys name to these numbers some of these include coxs amp kings top securities provouge reliance money ltd amongst others
2580528 in the long term we often have 98 accuracy in a mid term prediction it is almost 90 and as far as short term predictions used for intra day and intra hour trading it can vary from 80 85
2580529 financial astrology is different from normal astrology as predictions prove correct the belief in the system grows stronger however if you play it safe and combine this knowledge with other market related knowledge skill and patience this will be an immense success
2580530 astrology for businesses or private is not a belief system or only about prediction i use it as a tool i almost never predict anything as i feel that we have conscious choices and they can affect the outcome if we are conscious enough my take on astrology and not all astrologers do this is to take what you have and turn the negative patterns if thats how they are working into positive ones for both business and privately yes i use directors charts for companies of course that has an impact on a business usually you can find overlaps anyway i believe a company has a mission and a soul and a purpose the better that is understood the better the company can function in my view my view is to look at cycles and see how to take the opportunity presented a horoscope is a great analytical tool for companies individuals any groups and countries as well they too have a horoscope and this can be relevant for businesses nobody knows why astrology works i have my theories as im sure do others but no one knows why it works it just does
2580531 j pierpont morgan the worlds biggest financier drove the world before him because he had astrology behind him
2580532 however one must be warned not to indulge in cosmic sciences unless one is an expert as half knowledge is indeed dangerous this is as all numbers that add up to lucky numbers might not be good as seen in the case of mohandas k gandhi and benazir bhutto whose numbers added up to 51 5 1 6 which signifies assassination while say sharukh khan on the other hand has the number 42 also 4 2 6 which is a good number to have
2580533 oh where have you been my blue eyed son oh where have you been my darling young one ive stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains ive walked and ive crawled on six crooked highways ive stepped in the middle of seven sad forests ive been out in front of a dozen dead oceans ive been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard and its a hard and its a hard its a hard and its a hard and its a hard rains a gonna fall oh what did you see my blue eyed son oh what did you see my darling young one i saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it i saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it i saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin i saw a room full of men with their hammers a bleedin i saw a white ladder all covered with water i saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken i saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children and its a hard and its a hard its a hard its a hard and its a hard rains a gonna fall and what did you hear my blue eyed son and what did you hear my darling young one i heard the sound of a thunder it roared out a warnin heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a blazin heard ten thousand whisperin and nobody listenin heard one person starve i heard many people laughin heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley and its a hard and its a hard its a hard its a hard and its a hard rains a gonna fall oh who did you meet my blue eyed son who did you meet my darling young one i met a young child beside a dead pony i met a white man who walked a black dog i met a young woman whose body was burning i met a young girl she gave me a rainbow i met one man who was wounded in love i met another man who was wounded with hatred and its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard rains a gonna fall oh whatll you do now my blue eyed son and whatll you do now my darling young one im a goin back out fore the rain starts a fallin ill walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest where the people are many and their hands are all empty where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison where the executioners face is always well hidden where hunger is ugly where souls are forgotten where black is the color where none is the number and ill tell it and speak it and think it and breathe it and reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it then ill stand on the ocean until i start sinkin but ill know my song well before i start singin and its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard rains a gonna fall
2580534 hes got to have a solid family situation before he can even hope to come back into politics
2580535 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2580536 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2580537 i think it the affair shows a lack of judgment that you wouldnt want from someone who is even running for dog catcher
2580538 the first time he kissed her he should have been thinking goodbye to my political career

2580540 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2580541 i dont know what causes one to cross a bright line like this one but its probably going to haunt him for the rest of his life its colossal
2580542 fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make

2580549 if they dont water the greens during the day as i think they did on thursday the greens were pretty hard and firm and fast at 9 oclock so theyre going to be really firm and fast by 2 30 or 4 oclock
2580550 this is probably the toughest course ive ever played the rough is high and even if youre a good driver youre going to miss four fairways and the greens are tricky youre always putting up slopes

2580695 by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whither he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god through faith also sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth
2580696 we have many clients who have been touched by cancer some made it but others didnt

2580710 forty three percent of women have some sort of sexual dysfunction they have trouble with desire or they have trouble with arousal and this is a tool to use if you need help feeling more desirous feeling more aroused or something to increase the pleasure of your sexuality which is extremely important to women and it can be useful to men as well the problem is it can be a double edged sword in that anything really pleasurable can become kind of addictive
2580711 a lot of filmmakers have gotten really smart about putting together pornographic explicit films that are not denigrating to women none of us are going to get excited about seeing something where we feel bad for the woman
2580712 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken
2580713 somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium
2580714 the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
2580715 the private investigators as with all the other sightings and all the other information will be pursuing this line as an absolute priority to establish if it has been fully investigated and properly ruled out
2580716 they have got some of the information already from their lawyers and investigators and they are waiting to hear from them what is legitimate what is promising and what is not
2580717 they have learned an awful lot about this kind of thing and god forbid she has fallen foul of any of these types
2580718 all of this is important information we now have 80 new leads for our investigators to work on
2580719 there is of course one person who knows what has happened to madeleine and where she may be found
2580720 i ponder about that person whether that person has a heart and might understand what it must be like for madeleine to have been taken and secreted from her parents and siblings and those she loved and felt secure with
2580721 i ponder whether that person has a conscience or any feeling of guilt or remorse or even cares about the hurt that has been caused to an innocent little girl and whether that person has a faith or belief and what explanation or justification they might give to god
2580722 kate and gerry very much welcome that a compromise has been reached
2580723 the newspapers in this case brought about the total and utter devastation of mine and my familys life and caused immense distress
2580724 im pleased they have admitted the falsity of their allegations and i can start to rebuild my life
2580725 i can emerge from this action vindicated with the recognition and acknowledgement that what was said against me was wholly untrue
2580726 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document amp 183 as outlined in mr suskinds book
2580727 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2580728 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2580729 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2580730 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2580731 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2580732 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2580733 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2580734 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2580735 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2580736 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity
2580737 the main thing now is to get everything back to finding madeleine
2580738 all of this has damaged their good reputations and they will have to assess where they go from here
2580739 the only thing they care about is finding madeleine we hope that the portuguese authorities will continue to cooperate with their private investigation
2580740 the mccanns and their lawyers will still be anticipating that they should get an early sight of the police file enough to give them and their private investigators new leads to follow
2580741 everything in that file will have been investigated by portuguese authorities to some degree
2580742 ill never get this sweater finished with all these interruptions
2580743 you have me all wrong im not here to steal anything from you
2580744 please let me just use your phone for one minute
2580745 i think we should just call the whole thing off she leaned closer trying to make sense of the barely audible sounds emitting from the handset
2580746 posso dire di conoscere dopo quello che ho visto sentito e vissuto tre modi e tre strade per sfuggire al campo di concentramento
2580747 if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on we need to know what happened with this
2580748 he did not look like a nice person that stood out i think he spoke portuguese
2580749 i thought it all a little odd i heard the woman call the girl she didnt call her maddie but a longer name she could have said madeleine but i dont remember that
2580750 its frustrating beyond words its tragic it should come this late again one has to ask what the police were doing by not making this material available at the time
2580751 was the sighting followed up and ruled out properly we just do not know
2580752 she is a stranger she took me from my mummy
2580753 i asked where that holiday was but the little girl was incapable of telling me
2580754 i even asked if she was on a camping site or in a hotel but she was unable to say
2580755 i told her i thought she was very cute and asked if she wanted a balloon
2580756 i thought it all a little odd and then i heard the woman call the girl she didnt call her maddy but a longer name she could have said madeleine but i dont remember that
2580757 i served on that board for only a few weeks before resigning as soon as i became aware of public allegations against another member of the board
2580758 since concerns have been raised about that brief time i am stepping down to avoid distracting from barack obamas message of change

2580774 all of this has damaged their good reputations and they will have to assess where they go from here
2580775 the only thing they care about is finding madeleine we hope that the portuguese authorities will continue to cooperate with their private investigation
2580776 the mccanns and their lawyers will still be anticipating that they should get an early sight of the police file enough to give them and their private investigators new leads to follow
2580777 everything in that file will have been investigated by portuguese authorities to some degree
2580778 i hated having chubby cheeks when i was little and i find them extra annoying now

2580786 every expenditure has been in the context of fighting poverty
2580787 its very important for unions not to do this kind of thing
2580788 union leadership is a public trust all the more so when the people being represented are among the lowest paid in america
2580789 every expenditure has been in the context of fighting poverty
2580790 as far as i can determine the international union has not received allegations concerning freemans local if the international union receives allegations about a local that warrant further action we have internal union procedures for handling them
2580791 we re delighted to present the best of nbc s extensive coverage of the olympics
2580792 we know that our viewers will be glued to their sets during the special two weeks in august
2580793 without their collective support and understanding of the afn worldwide military broadcasting mission distribution of the 2008 beijing olympic summer games to our well deserving audience would not be possible
2580794 there will be more room for people to relax before they continue on the next leg of their journey
2580795 when the unit is tight and everybody trusts each other we have found through research they actually have less behavioral health problems less psychological issues
2580796 i won t say less stress but their reactions to that stress are decreased they don t have the significant issues that we find in units that don t have the high cohesion
2580797 we can give them the opportunity to get off their chests what s going on how they re feeling
2580798 it also gives us an idea of how the unit s doing to kind of get the cohesion back together and the combat effectiveness of the unit
2580799 just as we have co workers that may look at us and say are you doing ok
2580800 i used to go to the sparkasse and throw it in and get a receipt and put it in my account
2580801 we only know they do it how they do it we don t know
2580802 you bring the money and you get paper for it
2580803 this device takes over this time consuming work simply drop the mixed coins in the top opening quickly the coins are perfectly sorted into the waiting tubes
2580804 i stack it up in little piles then i use it
2580805 or you can bring it to mcdonald s and dump it there in the charity bin
2580806 i pour it into my hand and say this is what i have
2580807 you have no idea how satisfying it is to drill a really good hole
2580808 t he officers pepper sprayed sheehan but she continued to is zappos com getting into the music business we read twitter so you dont have to
2580809 i love it and have stalked it for years if i thought peeing on the gate to keep other people away would help i would be on my way up the hill right now
2580810 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2580811 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2580812 it goes without saying that bernie was one of the preeminent comedians of our generation
2580813 he was also an attentive husband a great father and loving grandfather i feel blessed to have shared years of friendship with bernie mac and im honored to have finally co starred with him in what i consider to be his finest cinematic acting achievement
2580814 my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2580815 he was one of those comics that was unique because of his approach his look his voice and the content of his material
2580816 bernie fell into that category of people who were inherently different like when you saw them you knew they were different and when they spoke you knew they were different
2580817 as comics were all brothers and ill miss him a lot he was a good friend of mine
2580818 he couldnt have been a nicer guy he just seemed like a real family man and just a nice guy on the set just very kind of normal guy
2580819 when i showed up to work he said something to me that had never been said to me on a set before
2580820 he said baby girl the script here is not the bible do you and ill follow i got mine you get yours when he said that i knew everything was going to be all right i was happy to have the freedom to make up some funny with him it was simply delicious
2580821 my working experiences with bernie were so amazing that from that point on i wouldnt have cared if he called me in the middle of the night to come and be in a scene where i didnt have anything to do but sit in the background and eat cereal i wouldve just done it because i loved him like that
2580822 were looking at a different paradigm of leadership and it plays naturally into the strengths of women
2580823 they were the artful maternity photos you see a lot today
2580824 so what are we supposed to do just not have kids
2580825 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2580826 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2580827 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2580828 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2580829 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2580830 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2580831 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2580832 bernie mac was a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place he was a tremendous live performer and a wonderful actor fox was proud to be the home of the bernie mac show and all of us at fox and 20th century fox television extend our deepest sympathies to his wife rhonda and daughter jeniece
2580833 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
2580834 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all

2580848 i want to do this even if my mother doesnt shave her head

2580856 had no reason to be more optimistic today than we were yesterday
2580857 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2580858 i dont think there will be any continuation of discussions on the statement the positions are too far apart
2580859 the pullout of georgian troops is the most important thing
2580860 to go as soon as possible to the region to propose to the parties concerned some elements to get out of the crisis

2580874 is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities
2580875 the leafs greatly reduced the number of opposition shots on goal last season and would have been much further ahead in the standings if not for raycrofts blunders
2580876 tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
2580877 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2580878 this was back when supporting americas efforts in iraq entailed serious serious political risk it was a clarifying moment it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
2580879 obama cast at least 10 votes for war funding bills before voting against one last year
2580880 if i had to give them a grade it would be an a today the new girls the returning girls they all did a good job today it was hot but we all played hard i think we showed we will have a lot of depth this year its a new level and its really exciting
2580881 certain pass plays i knew i was in trouble because i knew i wasnt capable of throwing a 20 yard out if coach jon gruden called that play last year i wasnt able to manage it i was thinking of ways i was going to survive the game and at least move the team down the field somehow some way
2580882 i think it is another step but for some reason im not really as nervous for that as i was the first two days of practice
2580883 i feel like ive got my feet under me and ive definitely got my confidence back my timing and rhythm are back so i feel this will be easier
2580884 im sure ill be nervous but i think im more excited than anything right now

2580887 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2580888 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2580889 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2580890 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2580891 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2580892 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2580893 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2580894 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2580903 there might be a ship called enterprise flying around but its probably not the same ship anymore
2580904 portals and other distributions services impose their own rules and limitations supposedly indie friendly distribution options like steam and instant action still have subjective gatekeepers

2580997 political affairs is an online magazine of ideology politics and culture our mission is to go beyond simply giving an account of events to providing analysis and investigating what is new and changing in our world from a working class point of view we start from the most basic fact of life the ongoing struggle between the working class and the capitalist class this conflict happens in the workplace in the government the courts on the streets but also in the realm of ideas we publish stories on struggling to defeat the ultra right in the republican party strengthening the labor movement winning the battle for racial justice ending war and imperialism winning womens equality fighting homophobia and presenting working class views of popular culture and mass media while we are partisan marxism is not the private property of any person or group we print a wide variety of views in our quest for truth discussion and debate are the only ways to develop better and more useful ideas to defeat the far right strengthen working people and build democracy
2580998 but the fact of the matter is that the frothier part the reason why we have had such a parabolic move in oil prices is because the so called

2581001 were hungry we spent three days in a bunker with no lights no gas no water
2581002 i thought they might be with them if theyre still alive
2581003 our husbands are not being let out even the old men theyre all dying fighting
2581004 but theyve also stayed because it brings shame on them to leave
2581005 the stores are either on fire or empty were heading back tonight but we dont know if we can get through
2581006 now people cant get out from tskhinvali even by foot
2581007 we will never forget this there are no words for what we lived
2581008 that such things could happen in the year 2008 i never thought was possible
2581009 our partnership with brussels airlines is particularly good for the clients of both airline companies as our route networks essentially are complementary as opposed to overlapping airbaltic has an excellent range of products in terms of flights to cis countries baltic countries and regional centres in scandinavia while brussels airlines offers attractive destinations in africa
2581010 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2581011 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2581012 shipments in the business jet and turboprop segments continue to rise steadily
2581013 expanding worldwide markets are having a very positive affect on the turbine segments of our industry
2581014 although total shipments in the piston segment are down for the first half of 2008 we believe recent success of the worlds premier general aviation show in oshkosh wisconsin is a good indicator of sustained enthusiasm for the light end of the market
2581015 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market
2581016 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2581017 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees
2581018 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2581019 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense

2581063 after a bout of sex the body releases endorphins known as happy chemicals
2581064 from a physical point of view its similar to enjoying a good workout or going swimming but if youre having sex with someone you love it also makes you feel cared for and promotes self esteem
2581065 theres no doubt that sex is relaxing and so helps tackle insomnia
2581066 lots of people use sex whether with a partner or on their own as a way of getting to sleep the surge in oxytocin is a natural sedative
2581067 it is also released in people in secure relationships and during sexual contact
2581068 often when i see couples in trouble they have stopped having sex and one of them will say their partner no longer finds them attractive
2581069 we know that having a strong relationship is a good indicator of longevity and a healthy sex life is a big part of that
2581070 they the teeth are absolutely invaluable it underpins everything that we learn about these animals theyre kind of like gold
2581071 having the teeth is quite unique because they were whole family pods and you dont get access to pods in any other way
2581072 to study these animals in the wild if theyre still alive and swimming around you just cant do it so even if you went to do biopsies for skin samples you just cant do it you never get the whole pod
2581073 you can count those ridges and it basically gives you the age of the animal

2581110 well walt wanted a variety we did wild things for that period we had various props and backgrounds that were fun and lighthearted we often used a steinberg 4 art style and he dug that it seemed really amazing because he had a lot of victorian and main street in his background

2581147 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2581148 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2581149 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2581150 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2581151 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2581152 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2581153 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2581154 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2581155 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2581156 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2581157 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2581158 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2581159 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2581160 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2581161 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2581162 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2581163 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2581164 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2581165 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2581166 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2581167 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2581168 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2581169 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2581170 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2581171 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2581172 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2581173 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2581174 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2581175 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2581176 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2581177 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2581178 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2581179 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2581180 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2581181 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2581182 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2581183 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2581184 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2581185 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2581186 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2581187 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2581188 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2581189 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2581190 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2581191 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2581192 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2581193 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2581194 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2581195 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2581196 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2581197 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2581198 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2581199 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2581200 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2581201 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2581202 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2581203 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

2581206 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2581207 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2581208 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2581209 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2581210 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

2581222 whats so good that you probably dont see is how many times he got us out of the wrong play and into the right play thats a real quarterback and thats exciting to me i didnt think hed be that far along and thats where coach kent austin has done a great job with him
2581223 enrique davis brandon bolden devin thomas theyre showing up cordera eason and derrick davis are solid and they know more
2581224 our offensive line is getting more physical and better darryl harris at left guard michael oher at left tackle john jerry at right tackle maurice miller at right guard and daverin geralds at center thats a good group theyre really gelling and were building some depth with bradley sowell and brandon green
2581225 defensively jamarca sanford is a leader hes a winner and a sure tackler

2581242 measuring defensive prowess and success has long been a difficult thing to accurately project particularly for individual players generally we use dated measures such as opponent field goal percentage opponent points per game rebounding rates and turnovers against while these all have their place every dedicated fan knows that much of what makes a great defender cannot be expressed in pure numbers alone something hoops addicts floor burn tournament is currently showing us we all accept that bruce bowen is an all world defender based on watching his tactfulness and tenaciousness first hand yet he is not one to lead the league in steals or blocks
2581243 when the nba stars kobe bryant lebron james and team usa square off against yao mings chinese national team on sunday the event will create fireworks that could rival the display in the opening ceremony of the olympics
2581244 i think close to 3 billion people are gonna be watching that game
2581245 and now for the somewhat ironic twist or at least ironic if you believe whispers team usa mastermind jerry colangelo wanted jkidd in beijing to help meld this array of superstar all stars into a team

2581248 he and the team have failed to reach an agreement on a contract extension since negotiations started last summer gordon turned down a five year 50 million offer from the bulls last october the team is believed now to have offered six years and approximately 60 million and do not want to go any higher because then they would be subject to the nbas luxury tax a dollar for dollar penalty when the payroll exceeds the tax threshold of 71 15 million dengs deal was within the market set for forwards of his experience and potential the bulls believe gordons asking price is out of the market line for a 6 2 shooting guard and sixth man
2581249 with a most un jordanesque performance in the nba finals bryant sidestepped harsh criticism upon losing the championship to the boston celtics this time the odds are on his side hes surrounded with the americans most complete and prepared team since barcelona and he knows well that should team usa win hell be hailed the hero lebron james carmelo anthony and dwyane wade were on site for that american debacle four years ago but bryant was nowhere near athens here he comes now a savior the most redeemed of the redeem team as much as anything though these games promise to be a salvation for bryant this is a chance for him to undergo yet one more transformation in a chameleon career of reinvention
2581250 as for bryant and james they are facing the same sort of criticism that michael jordan received while he was competing at the highest of levels in the nb a jordan wasnt one to speak up on controversial issues and that brings up the age old question should athletes be expected to make a stand on social issues some will suggest that athletes such as james and bryant who carry a large marketing portfolio dont want to incense advertisers by saying anything that could be perceived as controversial however speaking out on genocide or other social evils should be appealing to many companies looking to market products
2581251 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure

2581256 the wider public must understand indigenous peoples rights and concerns

2581265 dont shoot why video games really are linked to violence
2581266 far more than books movies or music games force you to make decisions all the intellectual benefits of gaming derive from this fundamental virtue because learning how to think is ultimately about learning how to make the right decisions weighing evidence analyzing situations consulting your long term goals and then deciding no other pop culture form directly engages the brains decision making apparatus in the same way

2581285 youre not going to like it in here im going to turn the water on
2581286 but once i get in the shower im not coming out to open the bathroom door for you youll just have to deal
2581287 i was just caught up in reading i didnt mean to ignore you was there something you needed should we have pancakes for breakfast this morning do you think i was thinking pancakes and sausage your fathers already gone out to play golf he left a couple of hours ago so its just you and me
2581288 i dont know i guess i just thought you might like to sleep in today since youre always up at the crack of dawn going for a run or whatever i mean whats the problem if you just take one morning out of the year to relax a little i think you work too hard anyway
2581289 but mom todays not the best time to sleep in because im going to be late for school
2581290 last night was the track meet remember track meets are always on a tuesday that makes today wednesday figure it out
2581291 no sweetheart the track meet wasnt last night we went to the last night dont you remember the film about the kidnapping i guess thats why youre tired this morning that damned film was so long we didnt get home until after midnight
2581292 mom what are you talking about we went to see that movie the week before last
2581293 last night was the regional track meet dont you remember bringing the juice and cookies for everyone
2581294 are you sure you dont want to go back to bed for a while darling
2581295 im worried youre not getting enough sleep and its having an effect on you a boy your age needs rest especially with all the exercising you do
2581296 mom already gave you your breakfast i saw it in the dish
2581297 if youre hungry you should just go to the kitchen and eat and quit following me around like a shadow
2581298 yeah great idea find some birds to watch to occupy your time
2581299 its just as i suspected casper the whole worlds gone nuts
2581300 but at least its a nice surprise that its saturday
2581301 and moms going to make pancakes if youre nice ill share one with you
2581302 casper i dont know what your deal is this morning but its a gorgeous day and theres no reason to let some silly bir uh what the
2581303 im uh i guess ive come at a bad time im im lucas marys nephew
2581304 come in lucas its not a bad time at all marys told us so much about you please join us everyone will be thrilled to meet you
2581305 were just starting lunch so youve arrived at a perfect time
2581306 my name is michaela and ill let the other ladies introduce themselves ah here we are
2581307 michaela would you mind bringing an extra chair in from the kitchen so we can make room for my handsome nephew
2581308 so lucas what brings you to my neck of the woods this afternoon
2581309 i came because i need to speak to you about something
2581310 your father and mother have filled your head with more stories about how we practice voodoo and worship animal gods over at my house and youve come to see if any of its true
2581311 no i need to talk to you about something else something that happened to me
2581312 michaela get my nephew a glass of wine would you please
2581313 but from what youve said so far i suspect that the matter is not of a deeply personal nature but rather deals with the unknown am i right
2581314 its just your luck that we have a veritable expert panel of the unknown here michaelas a professional at tarot and tea leaf reading karla has a sensitivity for spirits trapped between the two worlds petra can unleash the natural powers in crystals and other objects selene can read signs of the past in houses and buildings we have everything here lucas and were more than happy to help now relax and drink your wine and tell us what happened
2581315 lucas you say the voice you heard speaking to you was a woman is that correct
2581316 and she told you that you must go to the woman you saw in the vision
2581317 at least i think so she told me that i must go and i had a strong feeling that im supposed to find the woman i saw lying on that floor she told me that the woman was waiting for me
2581318 lucas do you feel you want to go find this woman
2581319 we humans like to think were the bosses of the world but not everything is always up to us
2581320 its true lucas i have no idea how were going to explain this to your parents but clearly this is your path a path that fate has chosen for you who are we to question that i think the consequences of you going are likely to be greater than those well face for stretching the truth to karen and bill they are after all just people and if youre answering to something higher now then they dont really have much authority over that
2581321 so lucas where is it youre supposed to go to find this woman
2581322 lucas im not sure how we could possibly explain something of that magnitude to your parents
2581323 i mean if you were travelling within the united states i could probably find some way to justify it to them or i could cover for you somehow but international travel lucas and with you still being a minor and all i just
2581324 mary like we all agreed before if he has to go then its not up to him or anyone else to question it
2581325 you should know better than anyone that thats not how destiny works its not like you can tell it no if you dont like the place its sending you to or you think the journey will be too difficult
2581326 well go together you can help me point myself in the right direction and ill personally escort you to your very own vacation in the old country
2581327 come on i know youve been wanting to see eastern europe since you were a little girl so now is your chance youd be safe with me and id be safe with you we could help each other
2581328 going to the old country is all youve ever talked about for years now and youve always said that the main thing that kept you from going was that you were a single female travelling alone so now you have an opportunity to go there with a handsome young man by your side one who is on a mission assigned to him by the universe itself how much more of a fairy tale do you want
2581329 we can see the world together i can do whatever it is im supposed to do and maybe along the way well even learn what the deal is with all those crazy cats gathering around the house im sure theres a reason for it
2581330 escalade guerri re entre la russie et la g orgie
2581331 sorry i mean did you say your name was the woman wrinkled her face up in confusion
2581332 this room is so echoey its difficult to hear things when everyone is talking and as you can see
2581333 my friends do like to talk i have no idea how theyre going to be completely silent for ten days
2581334 so terra is this your first time doing one of these things
2581335 ive been to quite a few of them actually never here though and obviously never with this group but yeah im not new to this
2581336 that you cant predict what will happen during one of our courses based on your previous experiences elsewhere we dont really copy anyone elses style we kind of have our own way of doing things here
2581337 yeah well im pretty open minded so i dont anticipate any snags
2581338 so i thought youd probably want clean sheets on the bed ill just be a few minutes
2581339 dinner will be at six followed by course instructions and then an early bed time
2581340 a bell will ring at six to let you know its time to come down
2581341 i thought wed have breakfast on the sofa this morning
2581342 since its the weekend and well you seem inclined to stay on the sofa all day anyway
2581343 cat im serious you are going to get stepped on and then youre going to cry about it
2581344 youre not going out to play and thats the end of that
2581345 darling if youre passing by the cellar could you pop down and bring some chicken up from the freezer for tonight i should get it defrosting as soon as possible
2581346 oh no you dont i know what your game is
2581347 mom caspers actually trying to open the cellar door on his own
2581348 seriously i swear i dont need to see a doctor please quit fussing
2581349 i found it on the floor in the kitchen do you have any idea what its for
2581350 i um yeah its an old key i found when i was on retreat i was going to make a christmas ornament out of it
2581351 i was just wondering if there was some reason you left the cellar door open and then walked through here like a zombie and dropped the chicken into the soapy dishwater as if it were a cannonball
2581352 now theres soap suds and water all over the floor and my guess would be that casper is exploring the dirtiest filthiest corners of the basement as we speak
2581353 hello is anyone in there can someone please come out and speak to me
2581354 i thought you would have called hours ago ive been trying to ring your phone but its switched off ive been worried sick are you not on the bus yet

2581369 the only comfort is that wiz was not injured in the heinous attack
2581370 two of the most supportive and friendly people that i have ever encountered they have a genuine knack for making everyone welcome and continued their support of ucla volleyball even after wiz graduated they love the sport and are beloved in the volleyball community
2581371 wiz has always been a dedicated athlete and teammate team has always come first to wiz just like family and that is because of the qualities instilled in her by todd and barbara
2581372 wiz worked tremendously hard as an athlete to pursue and live her dream of being an olympian always with the support of her parents her character driven lifestyle and her determination has earned her many friends and fans through her illustrious career
2581373 its a situation in which your mind races wondering who could have been involved
2581374 the fact that elisabeth was there and witnessed it well she doesnt deserve that
2581375 how could it be that during a defining moment in your life such a tragedy as this could touch your family its got to be difficult for him

2581387 yeah but arent they supposed to be getting things ready i mean certainly it takes more than just one girl on her own to organise the retreat and prepare everything
2581388 well maybe they prepared everything yesterday so that it would all be ready today

2581489 madeleine came here for lunch with her parents not long before she disappeared
2581490 i dont know if this guy took a picture of madeleine its impossible to say but he took a lot of photographs on the beach
2581491 the police said they had had complaints about a man acting strangely on the beaches they thought he might have been a watcher a voyeur they told me to get in touch if i saw him again but i never saw him after that
2581492 they came a lot but i only saw the mccann family here once
2581493 i saw the little blemish in her right eye she really stood out she was the absolute image of the missing madeleine
2581494 i was afraid to do anything i decided to get a good look to make sure it was her so i could report it

2581496 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist

2581503 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2581504 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2581505 we hope they find an agreement either before the referendum or immediately afterwards on just one interpretation of the rules
2581506 security as to how their votes will be counted and how the results will be defined

2581514 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2581515 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2581516 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries

2581601 i really liked the way our defense flew around and played downhill today
2581602 i wont know a whole lot more until our staff has a chance to go in and evaluate the film but out here on the field i liked what i saw we were also able to get some live special teams on film so that will help us evaluate who will be able to help us there
2581603 i was very disappointed in our performance up front offensively
2581604 right now we dont have the right mentality to run the football and that is something were going to have to work on next week once im able to put emotions aside and sit and evaluate the film later today ill be able to look at what we did well this morning and pick out what we need to work on
2581605 were excited about what we have seen from bryan schroeder
2581606 he has really picked up the offense and has been playing very physical so far in camp
2581607 i think you maybe have to be a little more patient when you have that many freshmen

2581609 now thanks to the internet super bowl commercials are like gifts that madison avenue tries to keep on giving as soon as the game ends video clips of the spots are posted online on the web sites of sponsors like fedex com the networks that broadcast the game like cbs sportsline com and internet media companies among them ifilm com msn foxsports com sports aol com and youtube com
2581610 this year advertisers buying spots during super bowl xli are frequently posting those ads online before theyre broadcast to try and create buzz
2581611 almost one third 30 percent of people surveyed will visit the companys website and that same number 31 percent will look for the ad online to view again marketers should make it easy for these people to find the ad by giving it a prominent position on their corporate website homepage without providing this kind of easy access to the advertisement marketers will risk losing visitors to those sites clearly dedicated to super bowl advertising such as google video or aol along with providing access to the tv ad these online destinations also provide message boards voting and other community features
2581612 masterfoods plans to extend the life of its 30 second snickers super bowl spot via a microsite that will feature player reactions to the commercial and alternate endings up to three such endings will be posted along with the version that will run during the game masterfoods declined to provide the full spot before the game but a clip of the first five seconds is viewable on the microsite which went live today

2581618 in an ironic twist of events nbc and the cw television networks refuse to air ads for documentary focusing on freedom of speech
2581619 its a sad commentary about the level of fear in our society that a movie about a group of courageous entertainers who were blacklisted for exercising their right of free speech is now itself being blacklisted by corporate america
2581620 the idea that anyone should be penalized for criticizing the president is sad and profoundly un american

2581724 this is a wonderful group of team members who will always have the privilege to say that they were the first out of 43 000 plus applicants to successfully complete the process and join the kmmg team
2581725 these team members went through a long process that involved giving up a lot of their free time in order to become team members in the coming weeks and months we will have many more classes of production and maintenance team members from our tremendous pool of applicants
2581726 were still in discussion about what the next vehicles and future vehicles will be

2581730 the reserves is something id always wanted to do and the opportunity presented itself in 2001
2581731 i didnt have any say i just had to accept it
2581732 we needed things to look forward to each day and each week and we tried not to dwell
2581733 we did things to try to make it feel like a different day every day there was groundhogs day
2581734 it was stupid stuff but we made a big deal about it and acted like it was christmas
2581735 we had to joke about stuff or else wed go crazy
2581736 people have been so supportive and that made it easier on me knowing people were looking after my family
2581737 we believe we were making a difference that what we were doing was really important and that makes the time away from my family meaningful
2581738 this was my job but she didnt have much of a choice in this it was laid in her lap and she had to take care of two boys the house the restaurant and our folks
2581739 hard to accept help swallow pride and sometimes ask for help
2581740 we kept going kept involved and there were saving graces along the way that made it fly by
2581741 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2581742 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2581743 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2581744 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2581745 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2581746 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2581747 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2581748 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2581749 i dont care who you were everybody was scared we thought this might be it
2581750 there were sharks in the water and who knew what else
2581751 we didnt want to go in thats for sure i was glad when they got that fire out
2581752 i didnt know what we were going to do but i knew something big was happening and i sure remember that ride
2581753 we all had to work but so did everybody else so we didnt think much about it
2581754 we were already worn out and then we had to run uphill
2581755 youd go in and theyd be sitting there in chairs waiting for somebody to ask to them to dance
2581756 but they could talk pretty good english when they needed to
2581757 you wouldnt think youd have to worry about something like that but it was a problem
2581758 it was good to get on dry land for a while
2581759 the weather was always pretty rough but we did what we had to do
2581760 i never got the malaria but a bunch of men did and it was bad stuff
2581761 when they got back a lot of them were shot up pretty bad
2581762 we were together the whole time i was in the service
2581763 and he really liked what we sang we turned out to be pretty good buddies but he was a hard man
2581764 that rope was crying like a baby when it unwrapped around those posts
2581765 the ground was shaking so bad you couldnt hardly stand up

2581767 he said bass im leaving sing me one more song
2581768 a few people wanted to make trouble but the teachers did a good job and most people tried to get along and that turned out all right finally
2581769 had no reason to be more optimistic today than we were yesterday
2581770 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2581771 i dont think there will be any continuation of discussions on the statement the positions are too far apart
2581772 the pullout of georgian troops is the most important thing
2581773 to go as soon as possible to the region to propose to the parties concerned some elements to get out of the crisis
2581774 an immediate cessation of hostilities the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia the re establishment of the situation that existed before

2581784 though 2008 has been flat up to now it is beginning to look better the prospects for wine investments in an investor portfolio and the industry growth are both looking excellent we are only at the beginning of a huge growth of interest in the very best wines especially in countries relatively new to wine such as russia korea china and india
2581785 we get enquries from individuals and wealth managers wanting to invest with us on a daily basis

2581790 the first test is the permatang pauh parliamentary by election on aug 26 and if umno is weak we will not be able to defend our foundation
2581791 what i mean is that umno has to shine again and we must know our weaknesses we should not be unduly worried about the clash under whatever circumstances
2581792 after the contest we have to come to terms with our views but this requires energy and thinking
2581793 so as far as possible the contest must be fought in an organised manner but after the by election we must close ranks to continue with our struggle
2581794 some people say it is easier said than done in politics it is difficult more so in a struggle but we must endure

2581807 the calderon government has acted with alacrity with intelligence and with boldness in its fight against organized crime and drug trafficking and we want to be part of that
2581808 one year after the murder of brad will no one has been arrested under the guise of stopping drug trafficking us taxpayers could be funding human rights violations corrupt local officials and blackwater style mercenaries in oaxaca and elsewhere this is exactly the wrong message to send at this time
2581809 without fundamental institutional reforms in mexico and concrete commitments on the part of the mexican government to cease its violations of labor and human rights we believe that the money requested by the administration will serve to reinforce a pattern of impunity
2581810 the repression of labor unions and human rights organizations will likely lead even more mexicans to conclude that their only future lies in migration to the u s
2581811 we are confident that congress will ask hard questions about the murder of us reporter brad will and not just rubber stamp this military aid package that could lead to further human rights abuses

2581818 what the christ is the matter with the jews bob
2581819 these are the enemies of strong societies thats why the communists and the left wingers are pushing the stuff theyre trying to destroy us
2581820 my little jimmy susie will be able to go buy pot down on the corner
2581821 respondents diane monson and angel raich use marijuana that has never been bought or sold that has never crossed state lines and that has had no demonstrable effect on the national market for marijuana if congress can regulate this under the commerce clause then it can regulate virtually anything and the federal government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers
2581822 you know its a funny thing every one of the bastards that are out for legalizing marijuana are jewish what the christ is the matter with the jews bob what is the matter with them i suppose it is because most of them are psychiatrists
2581823 but bob generally speaking you cant trust the bastards they turn on you am i wrong or right
2581824 jewish families are close but theres this strange malignancy that seems to creep among them radicalism
2581825 the jews the jews are are born spies you notice how many of them are just in up to their necks
2581826 what about the rich jews the irs is full of jews bob
2581827 now heres the point bob please get the names of the jews you know the big jewish contributors to the democrats could you please investigate some of the cocksuckers thats all
2581828 you can never put john any person who is a jew on a civil rights kind of case or freedom of the press kind of case and get even a ten percent chance basically who the hell are these people that stole the papers its too bad im sorry i was hoping one of them would be a gentile
2581829 as long as im sitting in the chair theres not going to be any jew appointed to that court no jew can be right on the criminal law issue
2581830 has to be broken or the countrys going down the drain
2581831 many jews in the communist conspiracy chambers and hiss were the only non jews many thought that hiss was he could have been a half every other one was a jew and it raised hell for us but in this case i hope to god hes not a jew

2581834 businesses in country a can trade with businesses in country b our government reserves the right to restrict trade in order to protect our fledgling industries and your government also has that right we expect labor standards in your country to be similar to labor standards in our country and we expect environmental standards in your country to be similar to those in our country if these standards are not met than trade will not be allowed we will tax your imports at a reasonable level and your government can also tax our exports to your country

2581838 part of a coalescence comprising hundreds of thousands of organizations with no center codified beliefs or charismatic leader the movement grows and spreads in every city and country
2581839 the movement cant be divided because it is atomized small pieces loosely joined it forms gathers and dissipates quickly many inside and out dismiss it as powerless but it has been known to bring down governments companies
2581840 in place of isms are processes concerns and compassion the movement demonstrates a pliable resonant and generous side of humanity
2581841 this unnamed movements big contribution is the absence of one big idea in its stead it offers thousands of practical and useful ideas
2581842 the movement has three basic roots the environmental and social justice movements and indigenous cultures resistance to globalization all of which are intertwining

2581924 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2581925 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2581926 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2581927 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2581928 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2582090 hes the fourth outfielder on this team but he will play trembley said
2582091 he deserves a shot he put up great humbers at bowie but this is the big leagues luke scott is playing with an achilles and a problem with his arch i will be reasonable with getting him out of there and reasonable with getting montanez in there but if people are waiting for him to play seven days in a row i dont think thats realistic
2582092 could you say that again but start it out by saying i want to apologize to the fans of baltimore
2582093 im really sorry it happened and i wont do it again but i dont think its anybodys business what i do to myself in the dugout during a frustrating moment i dont think the cameras should be in there

2582117 when anurag was shooting no smoking he told me you help me to make this film i will help you to make yours
2582118 you cant take them for granted you cant show them switzerland unless it fits into the film
2582119 what you need is the content a script a story the audience can connect to not big budgets
2582120 what aamir has done is that it has given hope to 10 new directors waiting in the wings
2582121 look indias changing too we should be more receptive to new ideas new stars new directors
2582122 though i am really sad i couldnt get to see the film with jhamu i am happy the film got made the way i wanted it to
2582123 its easier to get a break if you have made a certain number of films
2582124 there are so many different ways to exploit a film a producer was telling me nowadays there are 73 ways to get returns from one film
2582125 dont ask me the numbers but i know that the film has given all of us great returns on investment
2582126 i had worked out a story around match fixing and taken it to the bhatts of vishesh films they didnt think the story would click but soon after that the bob woolmer incident happened and the film was back on the table i spun the murky match fixing story around a love story and the audiences seem to have loved it
2582127 nothing can beat that experience of getting first hand reactions to things happening on screen
2582128 i have lots of ideas the good thing is the film industry too is opening up to new people like never before and that gives filmmakers like me hope
2582129 it also helps immensely if the first film does well at the box office
2582130 with the male dancers there is a novelty factor which attracts audience
2582131 down south there are a number of male dancers even today who take up dancing as a profession
2582132 almost every family down south is into some kind of art and thus have a very different thinking though i have seen male dancers finding it difficult to get shows as a number of organisers have a mindset that female dancers draw more crowds
2582133 male and female dance forms have always co existed however with women from educated background taking to dance even the traditional male dance forms were invaded kathak which was a male dominated dance forms now sees women in large numbers
2582134 i was simply mad about music and dance since childhood my father was not very happy seeing all this and i had to struggle a lot initially to take up dancing as a profession
2582135 my father thought that it was a low caste profession and that i would not have any future in this field but i still decided not to give up when your inner urge says that you have to do something nothing can stop you and without even caring for my future i just went ahead in the pursuit of my passion
2582136 the it and the bpo sector is what offers quick returns in comparison dance does not yield adequate monetary gains that is why parents think twice before sending their child to train as a dancer but the boys from the gharanas those who hail from traditional dance families are still very much into this field
2582137 naika doesnt have to do anything with gender naika doesnt mean she but is just a principle
2582138 when i learnt dance or when i teach the same right from the word go i dont concentrate on the gender aspect i took up dance because i love dance period
2582139 i am not restricted to just one person and then give it up when i want
2582140 right now i am totally fascinated by the projection of the devi in mythology and want to work on something related to that
2582141 i am fascinated by the shiva parvati lila right now and like to perform them shiva is a majestic dancer and i have always wanted to bring out the shiva tandavas in their proper way
2582142 every man has female qualities and vice versa and this aspect of their performance should be restricted to the stage itself in dance it should be the feelings of the character that must be portrayed to perfection but it shouldnt go beyond that
2582143 i see the fraternity growing and male dancers today are far more serious than their counterparts a few years back a whole new crop of male dancers is coming up
2582144 the world of dance is like a big ocean and one has to put in a lot of hard work there are no shortcuts to success in this field and you need to be original

2582195 the pullout of georgian troops is the most important thing
2582196 to go as soon as possible to the region to propose to the parties concerned some elements to get out of the crisis
2582197 an immediate cessation of hostilities the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia the re establishment of the situation that existed before
2582198 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2582199 the future world order is to be decided today in georgia
2582200 georgia could have used the years of saakashvilis presidency in different ways to build up the economy to develop the infrastructure to solve social issues both in south ossetia abkhazia and the whole state instead the georgian leadership with president saakashvili undertook consistent steps to increase its military budget from us 30 million to us 1 billion georgia was preparing for a military action
2582201 what we see here is not just a confrontation of minor republics but probably the confrontation between i am sorry to say that moscow and the entire west because now russia is basically protecting its clients and its own citizens up to 80 per cent of south ossetian population have russian passports
2582202 german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier was trying to solve the abkhazian conflict he proposed money to be allocated in the west in order to rebuild the infrastructure of this separatist republic but it didnt work because sides do not accept european mediators any more thats because the eu is politically too weak in the caucasus the eu has no real economic interests in the region and it has no armed forces there it failed in the past 16 years to develop some kind of co operation with russia and georgia or to join the peacekeeping missions in the region
2582203 several russian peacekeepers have been killed and that has greatly increased the stakes in the conflict because a few weeks ago president medvedev personally called mikhail saakashvili and asked him to refrain from using force against russian peacekeepers and the worst has happened the georgians killed russian peacekeepers in south ossetia and it is an attack not only against south ossetia its an attack against russia
2582204 add together the unfunded liabilities from medicare and social security and it comes to 99 2 trillion over the infinite horizon traditional medicare composes about 69 percent the new drug benefit roughly 17 percent and social security the remaining 14 percent
2582205 lets say you and i and bruce ericson and every u s citizen who is alive today decided to fully address this unfunded liability through lump sum payments from our own pocketbooks so that all of us and all future generations could be secure in the knowledge that we and they would receive promised benefits in perpetuity how much would we have to pay if we split the tab again the math is painful with a total population of 304 million from infants to the elderly the per person payment to the federal treasury would come to 330 000 this comes to 1 3 million per family of four over 25 times the average households income

2582213 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2582214 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2582215 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2582216 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2582217 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2582218 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2582219 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2582220 who are open to doing something on the production side
2582221 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2582222 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2582223 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2582224 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2582225 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2582226 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2582227 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2582228 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2582229 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2582230 um governo submetido a ch vez e ao ir n o tem nada de bom a conseguir
2582231 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2582232 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2582233 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2582234 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2582235 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2582236 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2582237 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2582238 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2582239 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2582240 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2582241 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2582242 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2582243 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2582244 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2582245 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2582246 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2582247 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2582248 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2582249 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2582250 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2582251 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2582252 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2582253 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2582254 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2582255 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2582256 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2582257 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2582258 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2582259 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2582260 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2582261 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2582262 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2582263 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2582264 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2582265 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2582266 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2582267 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2582268 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2582269 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2582270 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2582271 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2582272 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2582273 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2582274 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2582275 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2582276 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2582277 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

2582280 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2582281 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2582282 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2582283 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2582284 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2582285 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2582286 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2582287 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2582288 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2582289 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2582290 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2582291 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2582292 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2582293 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

2582310 this ad is a lie and it s part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true senator mccain continues to lie about senator obamas plan to give 95 of all families a tax cut of 1 000 and not raise taxes for those making under 250 000 a single dime the reason so many families are hurting today is because we ve had eight years of failed bush policies that senator mccain wants to continue for another four and thats what barack obama will change as president
2582311 john weaver for years one of john mccains closest friends and confidants has been in exile since his resignation from mccains presidential campaign last year
2582312 even some mccain allies have winced at the paris britney spot
2582313 because theyre so at variance with who he normally has been
2582314 i think theyve made a cold blooded calculated decision to refocus their campaign away from the positive toward the negative bring down barack obama at least two or three notches make fun of him and pave the way to the white house over time these kind of mocking ads will come back to haunt john mccain because theyre so at variance with who he normally has been but john mccain is increasingly put himself in danger that hes going to become the subject of ridicule
2582315 adopting the aggressive take no prisoners style of karl rove
2582316 as election day nears mccains campaign is adopting the aggressive take no prisoners style of karl rove the gop operative who engineered victories for president bush the campaign continued the attack wednesday with a sarcastic television ad deriding obama as a celebrity part of an intensifying effort to cast him as an elitist but the sharp edged approach is being orchestrated for an unpredictable candidate who often chafes at delivering the campaigns message of the day it is that freewheeling style that has made him popular with voters and cemented his reputation for candor and straight talk
2582317 mccain said at a town hall meeting here that he is proud of the ad as stressing substance and not style and his spokeswoman nicolle wallace defended it
2582318 refers to obamas march 2008 vote for a non binding budget resolution that would have set general revenue and spending targets for congressional tax writing and appropriations committees the resolution does not contain a specific provision to raise tax rates but rather assumes that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire as scheduled in 2011 it also bears no relation to obamas proposed economic plan in fact obama has stated repeatedly that his plan would increase taxes only for those making more than 250 000 per year
2582319 the most comprehensive nonpartisan analysis of obamas tax proposal available is the tax policy centers comparison of mccains and obamas economic plans that analysis mostly supports obamas claim that his plan wont raise taxes though it says that families earning between 169 480 and 237 040 would see an average tax increase of 486 under obamas plan all those earning less than 169 480 would see tax cuts in fact that hypothetical taxpayer with the 32 000 in taxable income would get a 502 tax cut under obamas plan mccains plan by contrast would leave that persons taxes unchanged
2582320 as we have described before budget resolutions basically set targets for appropriations committees to use they are more like guidelines than actual rules and like many budget resolutions this one passed on a party line vote with just one democrat and two republicans crossing party lines
2582321 budget resolutions merely set targets for tax writing and appropriations committees and dont alter the tax code directly
2582322 the budget resolution is not not a law not binding
2582323 i used to say that barack obama raises taxes i stand corrected
2582324 take this one for instance the choice in this election is stark and simple john mccain said at recent denver event repeating a phrase that is a staple of his stump speech
2582325 so i want to make a few things clear first the obama campaign calculates that its tax plan offers a net tax revenue reduction over ten years if the health plan is included second independent economists at the tax policy center come to the same conclusion third holtz eakin has repeatedly and quite seriously invoked the net tax cut calculations of obama to make the argument that the democrat has a fiscally irresponsible economic plan
2582326 benefits mostly those in higher income brackets while obamas plan benefits mostly those in lower and middle income tax brackets
2582327 they do however offer plans that differ strikingly from each other mccains tax plan benefits mostly those in higher income brackets while obamas plan benefits mostly those in lower and middle income tax brackets mccain wants a tax cut for corporate profits while obama has proposed a whole host of tax cuts that will benefit those in the middle income brackets
2582328 overwhelmingly most americans will not see their income taxes increased
2582329 points out that 95 1 of the american people are in households that earn less than 200 000 so overwhelmingly most americans will not see their income taxes increased if obamas math is correct
2582330 the mccain camp is attempting to persuade americans that their taxes will increase dramatically with barack obama as president the presumptive republican nominee has repeatedly said that obama would enact the largest tax increase since the second world war a surrogate former hewlett packard ceo carly fiorina insists that obama has not proposed a single tax cut and wants to raise every tax in the book the claim that obama will enact the largest tax increase since world war ii is also overblown the bush tax cuts will expire automatically at the end of 2010 so it is hardly a question of enacting a new tax increase carly fiorina is wrong to claim that obama has proposed no tax cuts and wants to raise every tax in the book john mccain is on more solid ground when he claims that americans from many different backgrounds could be affected by a rise in capital gains taxes but he has greatly exaggerated the adverse impact
2582331 so calling it a tax increase might not be considered fair
2582332 by the measure most economists prefer mccain is wrong in his claim that sens
2582333 the single largest tax increase since the second world war
2582334 offers three times the break for middle class families than proposals
2582335 the tax cut plan of democratic nominee to be barack obama offers three times the break for middle class families than proposals of likely republican nominee john mccain according to analysts working for a left leaning think tank families making between 37 595 and 66 354 of annual income with obama would get an average tax cut of 1 042 per family while mccains tax cut for this group would be 319 the report states
2582336 under mr obamas plan the middle of the middle class or those earning 37 595 to 66 354 would see taxes cut by 1 042 a year under mr mccains plan taxes for people in that category would also fall but by 319 the largest chunk of the benefits would go to those making 2 8 million a year or more
2582337 senator barack obama proposed a plan on tuesday to provide at least 80 billion a year in tax cuts to middle class workers homeowners and retirees saying if he was elected president he would end the preferential treatment thats built into our tax code mr obama said he would give a 500 tax credit to more than 150 million workers create a tax credit for homeowners who do not itemize their deductions and eliminate income taxes for older taxpayers who make less than 50 000 a year
2582338 the audacity of sen barack obama is now clear he actually intends to make tax fairness targeted at workers and seniors no less a platform in his candidacy for the white house obama just unveiled a proposal that would cut taxes by about 80 billion annually for middle class folks low income folks homeowners and seniors the senator would pay for this program by now get this increasing taxes on capital gains and dividends and eliminating other tax loopholes that primarily benefit the most well to do under obamas proposal more than 150 million workers those who have been left out during americas recent economic expansion would get a tax break better yet because their incomes are stagnant or declining theyll in all likelihood use this tax break to purchase necessities creating a stimulus in their local economies bushs tax break for dividends and capital gains on the other hand overwhelmingly benefits the richest americans according to internal revenue service data three quarters of this tax break about 68 billion annually goes to the wealthiest 0 6 percent of income earners while costing over 91 billion in 2005 alone not only does this worsen income inequality but it is patently anti capitalist eliminating this tax break would more than cover the 80 billion annual cost of obamas tax fairness pro capitalist initiative
2582339 obamas plans for reducing inequalities in tax policies and helping working families offer the better blueprint to move forward

2582449 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2582450 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2582451 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2582452 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2582453 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2582454 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2582455 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2582456 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2582457 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2582458 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2582459 we were delighted with the overwhelming response from the community
2582460 i stay focused on my highest priorities and dont worry about what isnt getting done since its not my highest priority
2582461 i relieve my stress by exercising every morning i also make sure my assistant schedules me in a hotel with an excellent fitness center when im on the road i stayed at a westin last week that had a treadmill in the room
2582462 spending time with my family including weekends at our second home on the lake helps me unwind its good to be in a different environment away from the everyday hustle and bustle
2582463 my mind can usually see things worse than they are i daily need to anchor my thinking in reality not fear of what might happen
2582464 it is still a zero draft we have experts in the public service who are still working on it it cannot possibly be implemented the way it is unless we look at the current structure in the civil service
2582465 the report is being discussed by the office of the president the prime minister and the ministry of public service
2582466 soon there will also be reshuffle of clerks in the civil service for effective delivery of services in the government
2582467 of course there are challenges which are to be expected in such an unprecedented arrangement
2582468 my first thought was that the driver would be dead
2582469 we were just really lucky he didnt hurt the guys
2582470 being back here is like being caressed by my beginnings
2582471 when i was here i took it for granted now im not taking anything for granted
2582472 i loved his music he made us all laugh and sing into the wee hours of the night no matter where we were he was just a really joyous person
2582473 maybe he didnt know that he wasnt going to make it it came as a shock to me
2582474 he had the same sense of humor that his father had
2582475 he always came up with the strangest type of joke
2582476 al perrin at the end of the month is taking my canoe and hes going to florida
2582477 it got a lot of play around here and it also got a lot of play in florida because it was about the florida keys
2582478 it was fun because my friends would call up from all over the place because they had heard it
2582479 he just had a way of getting in your life and staying there nothing about erik would ever make one not want to have him as a friend
2582480 it was me a city girl coming to a small town
2582481 everybody knew everybody they had stories that went back years
2582482 i am blessed but it seemed like music and writing found me it wasnt anything i chose to do

2582535 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2582536 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2582537 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2582538 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve

2582556 min f rste tanke var hvordan mit liv dog skulle v re uden min mor
2582557 jeg kunne n rmest m rke stilheden som om nogen var g et bort det var s dan en m rkelig f lelse
2582558 det var som om en klap gik ned det var ikke f r om aftenen at jeg kunne t nke klart min f rste tanke var hvordan mit liv dog skulle v re uden min mor
2582559 det var f rst bagefter at jeg kom i tanke om det da jeg gik ud til bussen vinkede hun til mig fra altanen jeg r bte op til hende at jeg gl dede mig til at bo t ttere p s vi kunne ses noget oftere hun r bte tilbage at det gjorde hun ogs bagefter slog det mig at det ikke virkede som om at hun havde ment det
2582560 hun ville aldrig v re til besv r for nogen
2582561 r dgiverne p b rnehjemmet mente at vi var for t tte p hinanden
2582562 de mente at jeg skulle g ud og f nogle flere venner p min egen alder men jeg foretrak at holde mig til de voksne m ske var det en m de at s ge tryghed p
2582563 jeg t nker nogle gange at hvis bare jeg var kommet lidt tidligere s var det m ske ikke sket
2582564 andre gange v gner jeg op og t nker jeg skal ogs lige huske at ringe til min mor s kommer jeg i tanke om at hun er d d og s bliver jeg ked af det der g r lige en halv dag f r jeg kommer over det
2582565 jeg spekulerer p om hun m ske t nkte at hun ikke l ngere beh vede at v re der for mig at hun gjorde det for sig selv for nu var der en anden til at tage sig af mig man pr ver vel altid at finde fornuft i galskaben
2582566 det er vel hendes m de at blive en del af fremtiden p
2582567 i min ungdom var det stedet hvor man kunne dr mme om fjerne steder n r de store skibe med eksotiske navne kom ind
2582568 inspiration foruds tter jo at man giver slip p det man arbejder med n r jeg sidder og arbejder med noget og g r i h rdknude s er d t at komme v k og f nogle helt andre impulser inspirerende
2582569 jeg fik 12 samtaler gennem sygesikringen men det var slet ikke nok
2582570 det skal ikke afh nge af hvor i landet man bor det b r afh nge af hvordan man har det
2582571 incestofre har brug for fler rige behandlingsforl b beslutningen om at lave en ordning med 12 psykologsamtaler er i bund og grund en d rlig forst else af hvad incestofre har v ret udsat for og hvad de har brug for
2582572 det er ildsj le der holder flere af stederne i gang det er en meget skr belig konstruktion
2582573 de regionale centre skulle kunne tilbyde behandling i form af professionel hj lp samtidig skulle de arbejde sammen med de frivillige centre hvor der tilbydes andre former for hj lp som man i dag g r p fyn s ledes repr senterer hj lpen et bredt spekter af forskellige st tte r dgivnings og behandlingsformer
2582574 man skal ikke bare reproducere den samme model uden at tage hensyn til de lokale kr fter der findes p omr det
2582575 s dan som det er lige nu er regeringen ikke opsat p at p tage sig nye opgaver men hvis man ikke hj lper disse mennesker s tilskriver man en regning til samfundet alligevel i form af sygefrav r d rlig trivsel og negativ social arv der videref res til n ste generation
2582576 jamen jeg h ber p at v re et sted hvor jeg slet ikke har forestillet mig at v re medmindre det alts er vestre f ngsel
2582577 hvem har du lavet aftalen med og hvem er din chef
2582578 det er jo s dan set fair nok at hun skal vide hvem der kommer og g r med deres computere det var mere hendes tone og hendes mistro til at det var noget jeg kunne magte
2582579 jeg t nkte at det da var en glimrende m de at tale om racisme p
2582580 da det kom til stykket turde komikerne ikke g p scenen og tale om racisme min f rste indskydelse var at aflyse showet men pengene fra puljen var jo allerede brugt
2582581 jeg var helt opslugt af programmering og af at hacke og s dan noget
2582582 jeg var endda med i s dan en hackegruppe der var dygtig
2582583 jeg gad ikke l re et programmeringssprog som alligevel var p vej ud vi skulle ogs l re tifinger systemet men det kunne jeg allerede
2582584 jeg kan huske at da jeg s fik 03 i faget hackede jeg computernes systemer s n r alle skolens computere startede op skulle man f rst se en fem minutter lang pornofilm
2582585 jeg startede produktionsselskabet fordi jeg prim rt gerne vil udvikle comedy koncepter og fordi jeg gerne vil lave ting der ikke n dvendigvis henvender sig til det danske marked
2582586 der har ogs altid v ret s dan en det kan du da ikke magte eller det der det g r da aldrig godt fra andre mennesker n r jeg er startet ud p nogle projekter for eksempel dem der siger at du da ikke kan lave et comedyprogram der henvender sig til hele verden n r du kommer fra danmark men hvem siger det
2582587 man skal ikke v re bange for fiaskoer det m man ogs gerne pr ve engang imellem
2582588 i danmark vil jeg leve et dr mmeliv med masser af penge jeg vil blive behandlet som en dronning
2582589 for de thailandske kvinder er gteskabet snarere et kollektivt projekt som g r ud p at forbedre ikke bare eget men ogs familiens liv i thailand
2582590 meget af det er kulturelt betinget i thailand er et gteskab ikke bare noget der handler om to mennesker det involverer hele familien
2582591 hvis kvinden kommer herop p et tre m neders visum s skal hun finde en mand inden for den tidsramme
2582592 m ndene vil altid sige at s dan er min kone ikke det kan godt v re at det er s dan for mange andre men s dan er det ikke for os
2582593 hvordan skal jeg dog klare mig selv i dette land
2582594 der er ofte problemer med familiesammenf rte b rn manden er ikke altid med p at det ikke kun handler om at f en kone men at der ogs er b rn inde i billedet
2582595 de thailandske veninder betyder helt vildt meget det er deres m de at v re i thailand p mens de er i danmark
2582596 et eksempel kan v re at hvis kvinden har f et et arbejde s vil hun gerne have sin egen konto og selv bestemme hvor mange penge der sendes hjem til familien i thailand hendes mand synes i stedet at pengene skal g til en f lles konto og bruges p dem selv
2582597 n r n klarer sig godt rent konomisk s forventes det at man deler hvad man har med familien
2582598 kvinderne bliver skuffede n r de indser at han m ske ikke har s mange penge som de troede
2582599 o que importa a educa o n o a tecnologia
2582600 how can you decide which patient needs the respirator more than the other it is such a dilemma
2582601 there have been times when relatives realized that their patient was alive only because he or she had been strapped to the life support system and when they ran out of money they decided to take the patient home against medical advice
2582602 we practise things but dont have laws about them we seem to live in a state which seems to have overwhelming control on the way we live people say a law on euthanasia will be misused but that argument is bogus in netherlands for instance where euthanasia is allowed there has been no evidence of misuse
2582603 a solution would be to have committees drawing people from several walks of life to debate on medical dilemmas in britain for instance the national health service and clinical excellence has committees for each disease
2582604 when the medical termination of pregnancy act came into being in early seventies social norms prevailing at that time demanded that we cut down on our population religious groups opposed the move but social responsibility overrode all other claims

2582620 but it was great of him to come out and do this race and to race with all the people hes a class act out there it was fun we didnt talk a whole lot because it seemed like it was pretty much business
2582621 at the end i realized i was thoroughly cooked but i said i am having a good time
2582622 thats why i wanted to come out here i didnt expect to beat this guy so i just wanted have something out there to shoot for train for stay in shape for and it was a blast it really was

2582628 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know

2582630 of the 50 top performing funds in 2000 not a single one appeard on the list in either 1999 or 1998
2582631 using past performance numbers as a method for choosing mutual funds is such a lousy idea that mutual fund companies are required by law to tell you it is a lousy idea
2582632 the enemy of a good plan is the search for a perfect plan
2582633 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know

2582644 when most of these people started they struggled to get into the wasp ish advertising agencies but they had to earn a living somehow and working on comic books was about as good as they could get at the time
2582645 it does beggar belief that in the early years about 70 per cent of the industry was jewish
2582646 jews have a vast treasure trove of legends that are passed on to us by our parents and our culture also its undeniable that as a jew you like to tell stories
2582647 polish people feel a lot of hatred from israelis visiting poland

2582655 i know that the folks here in hawaii are especially hard hit because everything has to come into hawaii and gas prices have gone up the roof fuel prices have gone through the roof and its time that you got some real relief and that means actually starting to have an energy policy in this country that makes sense
2582656 weve been divided for so long weve been arguing for so long a lot of times about things that arent even worth arguing about and ignoring the things that we should be doing to make the next generation have a better life
2582657 but they also deserve a civilian leadership that understands that the most important thing we can do to make ourselves safe is to fight the right wars to finish the job in afghanistan and start bringing this war in iraq to a close start bringing our troops out and when they come home to treat them with the dignity and respect they deserve no more homeless vets no more begging for disability payments

2582687 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2582688 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2582689 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2582690 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2582691 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2582692 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2582693 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2582694 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2582721 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2582722 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2582723 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2582724 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2582725 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2582726 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist

2582773 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2582774 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2582775 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2582776 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2582777 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2582778 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different than any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2582779 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2582780 bernie mac was a gifted talent whose comedy came from an authentic and highly personal place he was a tremendous live performer and a wonderful actor fox was proud to be the home of the bernie mac show and all of us at fox and 20th century fox television extend our deepest sympathies to his wife rhonda and daughter jeniece
2582781 bernies style of comedy was bold courageous and revolutionary i never knew anyone who loved to be funny as much as bernie he will most definitely be very missed
2582782 as for anyone doing it wrong i simply prefer to think of it as them not quite being where they need to be yet all this openness makes us pass judgment too harshly and too quickly i think lets give companies and people time to learn and grow in their blogging
2582783 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory
2582784 he seeing this before spoke of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left in hell neither his flesh did see corruption
2582785 all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness
2582786 the earth is utterly broken down the earth is clean dissolved the earth is moved exceedingly the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard and shall be removed like a cottage and the transgressions thereof shall be heavy upon it and it shall fall and not rise again
2582787 and all the host of heaven shall be dissolved and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll and all there host shall fall down as the leaf falleth off from the vine and as a falling fig from the fig tree
2582788 but the day of the lord shall come as a theif in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up
2582789 and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every island and mountain were moved out of their places
2582790 but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
2582791 jesus said unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
2582792 but i fear lest by any means as the serpent deceived eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ
2582793 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved
2582794 adolf hitler son of the catholic church died while defending christianity
2582795 over his mortal remains stands his victorious moral figure with the palm of the martyr god gives hitler the laurels of victory
2582796 i learned much from the order of the jesuits until now there has never been anything more grandiose on the earth than the hierarchical organization of the catholic church i transferred much of this organization into my own party
2582797 the s s organization had been constituted by himmler according to the principles of the jesuit order their regulations and the spiritual exercises prescribed by ignatius of loyola were the model himmler tried to copy exactly himmlers title as supreme chief of the s s was to be the equivalent of the jesuits general and the whole structure was a close imitation of the catholic churchs hierarchical order
2582798 the third reich is the first world power which not only acknowledges but also puts into practice the high principles of the papacy
2582799 i am personally convinced of the great power and deep significance of christianity and i wont allow any other religion to be promoted that is why i have turned away from ludendorff and that is why i reject that book by rosenberg it was written by a protestant it is not a party book it was not written by him as a party man the protestants can be left to argue with him as a catholic i never feel comfortable in the evangelical church or its structures that is why i will have great difficulty if i try to regulate affairs of the protestant churches the evangelical people or the protestants will in any case reject me but you can be sure i will protect the rights and freedoms of the churches and not let them be touched so that you need have no fears about the future of the church
2582800 as for the jews i am just carrying on with the same policy which the catholic church has adopted for fifteen hundred years when it has regarded the jews as dangerous and pushed them into ghettos etc because it knew what the jews were like i dont put race above religion but i do see the danger in the representatives of this race for church and state and perhaps i am doing christianity a great service
2582801 boy i hope i can make some money doing this

2582854 but it s the word pull and its disorienting use by silverstein six years ago that we re reminiscing about here anyone who s seen the short video segment snipped from the 2002 pbs documentary america rebuilds finds it hard to interpret silverstein s comments any other way he and the fdny made a decision pushed a button and brought the building down they had to it was going to collapse anyway possibly onto neighboring structures it was also surrounded by firefighters and rescue workers when this attempt by silverstein to explain the bizarre collapse of his building created more suspicion that it dispelled he later claimed that he used the word pull as a synonym for evacuation which for a number of reasons has only added to the confusion if this convoluted scheme worked to silverstein s advantage it s hard to see how six years later the story has appeared in books articles and documentaries by the score it s also become a web sensation evidence that silverstein s little scheme actually backfired badly is everywhere i ve always felt an affinity towards this story but not just because it s such a hoot to watch these guys trip over themselves after perpetrating a dirty trick like 9 11 it s for an entirely different reason the story began in my living room

2582977 dag kindje is er al meer nieuws heb je mama trouwens niet gezien
2582978 mama neen die heb ik niet meer gezien was die niet bij jou ik dacht dat ze naar de match kwam kijken
2582979 naar de match kijken jouw moeder komt nooit naar de match kijken ze komt alleen maar pronken in de eretribunes met haar nieuwe kleren en roddelen met haar vriendinnen
2582980 er was nog een tweede vraag is er al meer nieuws over veronica is er nog een dokter langs geweest
2582981 ik heb heel even een dokter gezien maar er is geen verandering in de situatie
2582982 paps ik ben zo bang dat het fout gaat aflopen
2582983 ik kan de situatie ook helemaal niet vatten meisje ik begrijp het allemaal niet en toch ben ik er zeker van dat alles goed zal aflopen
2582984 het reality programma the cruise is aan zijn tweede editie toe vorig seizoen waren er twee oud inwoners van deze stad kandidaat en ook deze keer heeft onze zoektocht twee kandidaten uit onze stad op geleverd het is een ongewoon duo geworden maar wie het zijn dat kom je te weten in de eerste aflevering van the cruise ii veel kijkplezier
2582985 ik vraag mij af wie ze uit onze stad weer zo zit gekregen hebben om aan deel te nemen aan mij hadden ze het alvast niet moeten vragen ik zou nooit aan zoiets meedoen waar ligt de zapper want ik heb geen zin om naar zoiets te kijken
2582986 ik vond het eerste seizoen anders wel leuk vooral bionda en marino vond ik erg leuk
2582987 marino amp bionda nooit van gehoord wie waren de kandidaten uit deze stad
2582988 pap houdt helemaal niet van die programmas maar hij is er toch wel nieuwsgierig naar
2582989 euhm als ik mij niet vergis was dat een wat ouder koppel valda maar haar familienaam weet ik niet meer en haar duo partner was valere de vilder
2582990 ha valere de eigenaar van scheepswerf de vilder althans vroeger was hij de eigenaar intussen heeft zijn zoon jacob de zaak onder diens leiding genomen scheepswerf de vilder had tot voor kort een aantal business seats bij ons blijkbaar gingen zaken doen en voetbal toen goed samen nu jacob de zaak in handen heeft zie ik deze wel niet zo vaak meer in het stadion die jacob houdt volgens mij niet echt van voetbal
2582991 kon men echt niemand beter vinden om langevroeg af te vaardigen
2582992 een straatmuzikant annex zwerver en zoiets moet onze stad dan verdedigen
2582993 pap sttt de andere kandidaat uit langevroeg komt er zo aan
2582994 en dan zappen we naar een andere zender binnen een halfuur begint het sportprogramma we hebben dan wel verloren maar ik wil eens zien wat de pers over ons te vertellen heeft
2582995 ik wil dit programma uitkijken en ik denk dat veronica dat ook wil
2582996 onze volgende kandidaat is een bekend persoon een bekende vlaming maar niet alleen wereldberoemd in vlaanderen zij is een zangeres en heeft ook al diverse hits gescoord in nederland en de rest van europa haar deelname aan the cruise was een last minute beslissing maar wij zijn heel blij dat deze knappe lieve en sympathieke vrouw de strijd wil aangaan in the cruise ii
2582997 als mijn dochter wil verder kijken dan wil ik haar zeker niet tegenhouden maar dan ga ik thuis wel naar mijn sportprogramma kijken
2582998 oh ik dacht dat ik met je mee naar huis kon rijden
2582999 dat zal niet gaan meisje mijn wagen is enkele dagen geleden in de fik gevlogen
2583000 dat vertel ik je later wel kindje ik neem een taxi naar huis zie ik je daar straks heb je geld nodig voor een taxi
2583001 oh neen dat hoeft niet ik bel anthony wel als de bezoektijd gedaan is gaan we nog even iets drinken en dan kom ik naar huis
2583002 als je je broer ergens tegenkomt zeg dan dat hij contact opneemt met zijn vader of zijn moeder die jongen heeft al enkele dagen niets van zich laten horen en dat kan niet
2583003 goed als ik dennis tegenkom zal ik het hem zeggen tot later paps
2583004 dames en heren jongens en meisjes een groot applaus voor barbara verduin
2583005 is het niet zo dat jij je gezin in de steek laat net nu er een moeilijke periode is aangetreden
2583006 martin vindt het niet erg hij weet wat er speelt tussen mij en dominique
2583007 wij kunnen je uiteraard over de belangrijke gebeurtenissen binnen je gezin wel op de hoogte houden maar vertel eens mevrouw verduin waarom wil je eigenlijk deelnemen aan the cruise waarom heb je ondanks de ontwikkelingen in je familie last minute toch besloten om deel te nemen aan the cruise
2583008 je moet ook niet alles geloven wat de media over de familie verduin schrijft mevrouwtje goderis oh en zeg maar barbara
2583009 goed barbara maar dat was niet echt een antwoord op mijn vraag
2583010 wel in de eerste plaats kan dit een boost zijn om mijn carri re nieuw leven in te blazen niet dat het slecht gaat met mijn zangcarri re verre van zelfs er zijn plannen voor een nieuwe single en een nieuwe cd maar momenteel heeft mijn manager andere prioriteiten hij heeft zich op n of ander beginnend zangeresje gestort en met alle respect voor juffrouw goeds maar zij heeft het niet ze mag nog zoveel nummers van mij stelen ze zal nooit een even grote ster als ik worden laat ons zeggen dat ik deelneem bij wijze van extra publiciteit voor mezelf publiciteit is altijd goed en zeker voor de toekomst
2583011 dat heeft ze inderdaad goed gezien publiciteit is altijd welkom ik wist helemaal niet dat victor nog met een andere zangeres in zee is gegaan en al zeker niet dat hij barbaras zangcarriere hierdoor verwaarloosde als ik hem tegenkom zal ik toch wel eens een hartig woordje met meneer de manager spreken
2583012 en ik die dacht dat jij helemaal niet zo blij was met de zangcarriere van mama en nog minder met het vele toeren
2583013 stil nu maar meisje ik probeer dit interview te volgen en dat ik haar alle succes gun dat weet je toch
2583014 euhm om heel eerlijk te zijn niet nee ik ben onlangs eerder op een toevallige manier in contact gekomen met een talentvol aanstormend talent iemand in wie ik in tegenstelling tot nina goeds wel in geloof musido is n van de toekomstige talenten en omdat ik talentvolle mensen wil steunen en ik in hem geloof wil ik hem aan boord een beetje coachen wat tips geven helpen bij het schrijven van nummers wie weet groeit er wel een duet of een samenwerking uit
2583015 mevrouw verduin excuseer barbara u zult straks misschien niet meer zo blij zijn met uw deelname
2583016 alles wat jij hebt meegemaakt heeft jou in het diepst geraakt dat deed jou hart telkens pijn je mag nu vrolijk zijn vaarwel verleden ik ga de toekomst in het leed is geleden dit is een nieuw begin ik kijk niet om naar wat ik achterlaat vaarwel verleden hoop dat het in de toekomst beter gaat
2583017 even lekker relaxen met dat spul ik wil geen drugs in mijn club
2583018 doe eens even rustig ik heb ook een deel van de aandelen dus het is niet jouw maar onze club
2583019 waarom niet ik wil dat yasmina weet dat ze op het punt staat om met een onbetrouwbaar individu en tevens een junk te gaan trouwen
2583020 jij bent eigenlijk best een lekker wijf als je boos bent
2583021 vaarwel john dit is om wat je mij allemaal hebt aangedaan
2583022 niet doen niet doen heb ik de kans gekregen om te smeken dat je me met rust moest laten
2583023 jij hebt alles van mij afgepakt mijn hele leven is naar de verdoemenis ik heb de club niet meer ik heb de baby laten weghalen omdat
2583024 en weet je wat het ergste is dat je niet alleen mijn leven maar ook dat van mijn zusje heb kapot gemaakt
2583025 het spijt mij dat ik je niet heb kunnen helpen
2583026 oh maar dat was toch geen enkel probleem ik vond jouw gezelschap het afgelopen weekend erg leuk en het was tof om eens een ander gezicht in huis te zien paps en mams zijn zelden thuis zoals je gemerkt hebt en het personeel dat we hebben is wel goed maar dat zijn nu niet echt de mensen met wie ik goede gesprekken kan voeren
2583027 ja met robbie wel ik ben zo blij dat hij deze middag het ziekenhuis mag verlaten
2583028 ik ga dan wel naar huis maar ik geef het nog niet op met charlotte
2583029 zo wil ik het horen maar ben je niet bang dat als je er niet zal zijn dat haar band met anthony nog zal vergroten
2583030 ik denk ik denk inderdaad dat het geen slimme zet is om huiswaarts te keren maar ik kan op dit moment niet anders misschien kan jij
2583031 misschien kan ik er voor zorgen dat ik wat in de buurt van charlotte kan rondhangen zodat ze niet altijd de kans krijgt om rond anthony te draaien
2583032 zou jij dat aan charlotte willen geven ik heb dat voor haar gekocht maar heb dit weekend de kans niet gekregen om het haar te geven ik heb er deze ochtend nog snel een briefje bijgeschreven waarin ik mijn gevoelens heb neergepend
2583033 dat hoop ik ook je bent altijd welkom en niet alleen in langevroeg maar ook bij mij thuis
2583034 ik zou maar opschieten als ik jou was straks mis je je trein nog
2583035 als ik jou was zou ik ook een beetje voortmaken of je mist je eerste lesuur nog
2583036 ik ben georgina en als je zin hebt wil ik je wel wat wegwijs maken in langevroeg
2583037 gingey is duh naam en den haag kan nog wel even wachten
2583038 ik snap nog altijd niet hoe niemand van ons gemerkt heeft dat ze er alleen vandoor is gegaan
2583039 we hadden het allemaal veel te druk met ons zelf
2583040 wij moeten ons toch niet schuldig voelen over wat er met veronica is gebeurd niemand van ons kon weten dat ze dit zou doen
2583041 er is iets op mijn maag blijven tuurlijk maak ik me zorgen over veronica maar ik was even niet aan haar aan het denken ik was aan het piekeren over gisterenavond
2583042 tuurlijk bedoel ik dat ik wist dat jij die middag alleen was en dus kwam ik je opzoeken we hebben ons prettig vermaakt maar jouw zus moest alles komen verstoren
2583043 oh neen het leek mij anders wel duidelijk ze wil niet dat ik jouw vriendje ben dat heb ik door haar opmerkingen wel begrepen wat is er mis met mij
2583044 beschermen voor mij en waarom dan als ik vragen mag ze kent mij niet eens
2583045 ik heb gisteren een hele discussie met anna gehad ze kent jou inderdaad niet maar ze kent jouw vader en zijn reputatie
2583046 ik ben toch mijn vader niet en ik sta nog minder in voor zijn daden het is niet omdat mijn pa er meer dronken dan nuchter bij loopt en dat hij het al eens bont maakt in het caf of in het stadion dat ik dat ook doe ik dacht dat jij mij toch al wat beter kende
2583047 arnout wacht nu toch we kunnen er toch over praten
2583048 hey keish sorry dat ik je stem niet meteen herkende maar het is dan ook een tijdje geleden dat we elkaar gezien of gesproken hoe gaat het met je heb je het geboortekaartje en de fotos van mijn zoontje bono gezien
2583049 hoezo jij wist van niets dan heeft de britse post zijn werk vast niet goed gedaan of heeft de belgische post een steekje laten vallen
2583050 hoezo keisha ik begrijp het allemaal niet en robert en ryan
2583051 ik ben niet meer in de uk omdat ik in het klavermeerpark ben
2583052 papa is voor het werk met het vliegtuig naar een ver land
2583053 nog n keertje slapen en daarna gaan we naar het zwembad
2583054 hey zusje wat scheelt er met je ben je niet blij om me te zien
2583055 juist wel ik kan niet geloven dat jij er bent
2583056 ik vroeg mij eigenlijk af hoe het zit met de zaak rond martin verduin
2583057 martin verduin die zaak zijn wij de laatste tijd wat uit het oog verloren
2583058 er gebeurd iets in deze stad met n van onze prominenten iemand die regelmatig in de nationale pers staat je weet dus dat de journalisten op onze vingers meekijken en die niet alleen de burgemeester heeft er bij mij op aangedrongen om deze aanslag verder uit te zoeken een aanslag in deze stad is geen goede reclame en zeker niet nu de zomer in het vooruitzicht is en we weer dagelijks een hele hoop toeristen verwachten
2583059 vind jij dat grappig ofzo ik vind het allerminst grappig ik wil dat jullie nu deze zaak verder uitpluizen en jullie stoppen niet tot dit is uitgeklaard leg martin op de rooster en probeer uit te zoeken wie zijn vijanden zijn
2583060 dat is goed commissaris zo lang jij ons niet meer opzadelt met verkeersboetes en dergelijke uit te gaan schrijven want dat is wat er ons de laatste dagen van weerhouden heeft
2583061 ga je nu zeggen dat het mijn schuld is dat de zaak verduin nog niet is opgelost
2583062 sanchez onder mijn ogen uit en neem je collega mee ik wil jullie hier vandaag niet meer zien en ik eis resultaten vandaag nog
2583063 och onze commissaris een beetje op stang jagen kan nooit kwaad
2583064 ja maar nu zitten we weer met de gevolgen moeten we die verduin weer gaan verhoren
2583065 eerst nog een kopje koffie alvorens we die verduin gaan opzoeken
2583066 er heeft zich daarnet een meisje bij mij aan de balie zich aangemeld veel heeft ze niet gezegd maar
2583067 ze klonk nogal verward en het lag allemaal nogal delicaat zo vertelde ze ze wil ook enkel met een vrouwelijke agente spreken
2583068 ik heb haar naar een verhoorkamer laten brengen heb jij even de tijd om naar haar verhaal te luisteren
2583069 ja geen enkel probleem maarten moet maar even wachten net zoals het onderzoek waar we van de grote chef aan moesten werken dit gaat voor
2583070 welke rol speel ik in die plannen ik neem aan dat je mij dit nieuws niet zomaar vertelt
2583071 tuurlijk vertel ik je dat niet zomaar ik wil dat jij me helpt bij dit project
2583072 ik weet dat jij er al lang van droomt om een bed en breakfast met een manege te openen je hebt altijd gezegd dat je dat in het buitenland wou doen maar aangezien arend jan niet van plan is om snel weg te gaan uit langevroeg gezien zijn positie binnen de club en zijn eigen immobili nbedrijf wil ik dit plan hier verwezenlijken jij hoort bij mijn plannen die bed en breakfast zou dan wel een klassehotel worden maar het terrein dat ik in gedachte heb heeft voldoende plaats om een manege uit te bouwen ik wordt natuurlijk de directrice van het hele geheel maar ik wil jou als onderdirecteur van het hotel en als grote baas van de manege
2583073 ik moet toch nu niet beslissen of ik mee in dit project stap
2583074 ondere andere voor de voetbalclub en in zekere mate ook voor anna
2583075 het project dat ik in gedachten heb kost natuurlijk handenvol geld ik heb een fantastisch stuk grond gezien waar ik wil gaan bouwen maar daarover zal ik binnenkort wel eens met je man spreken de gevolgen die ik bedoel hebben te maken met het supporterslokaal mijn man is de eigenaar van het pand maar ik bezit als uitbaatster wel alle aandelen die aandelen wil ik van de hand doen en ik zou het pand willen verkopen
2583076 dat zal er vanaf hangen wat de nieuwe eigenaar van plan is met dat pand vanzelfsprekend wil ik anna eventueel een job aanbieden in ons hotel indien het supporterslokaal verdwijnt maar dat zijn zorgen voor later althans niet echt zorgen voor mij we zullen wel zien hoe alles verder loopt champagne om mijn plannen te vieren
2583077 ja champagne dat klinkt niet slecht maar dan niet alleen om jou plannen te vieren maar ook omdat ik mee in het avontuur stap
2583078 tuurlijk meen ik dat het leven is aan de durvers en ik durf
2583079 we gaan het rustig aan doen maar ik zal je toch ook moeten vragen of we dit gesprek mogen opnemen dat is standaardprocedure voor minderjarigen elke ondervraging moet worden vastgelegd via de camera
2583080 ik weet natuurlijk niet om welke feiten het gaat maar de beelden worden normaal enkel bewaard en slechts in een enkel geval kunnen deze gebruikt worden in de rechtzaal maar zover zijn we zeker nog niet indien de feiten ernstig genoeg zijn kan ook de dan aangestelde onderzoeksrechter de beelden opvragen maar voor we verder gaan moet ik gewoon je toestemming vragen
2583081 mag ik jouw naam vragen jouw geboortedatum en je leeftijd
2583082 vicky van elsen vijftien jaar twaalf maart negentienhonderd drie nnegentig
2583083 goed vicky ik zou graag je verhaal horen doe het maar rustig aan en als je even wilt stoppen dan doen we dat gewoon
2583084 ik ben boven knock out gegaan waarschijnlijk doordat ik teveel had gedronken toen ik weer bijkwam
2583085 hij zat aan mij hij knoopte mijn bloesje los en wilde mij verkrachten
2583086 je kan hem daar net zo laten liggen zal ik een ambulance sturen
2583087 euhm ik denk dat dat het beste is maar kan ik in tussen nog iets doen
2583088 zorg dat je niet te laat komt in de biologieles je kent pessemiers en je weet hoe die is als je te laat opdaagt
2583089 ga maar ik zal wel zorgen dat ik op tijd ben maar ik moet eerst nog even met meneer hoogwaart spreken
2583090 ik denk dat je verwacht wordt in de les biologie niet
2583091 ik zie je straks wel in de lerarenkamer en dan praten we wel verder
2583092 ik toen ik daarnet aan het nadenken was toen dacht ik
2583093 hoezo dit kan niet kan dit nooit of kan dit gewoon hier niet
2583094 boven op dat kamertje in de surfclub had je er anders geen enkel probleem mee
2583095 vicky wat er in de surfclub gebeurd is is niet hetgene wat jij denkt dat er gebeurd is
2583096 oh neen hoe moet ik het dan zien jij hebt mij graag en jij had zin in mij daarom heb je mij dronken gevoerd en naar dat kamertje gebracht
2583097 ik heb je helemaal niet naar dat kamertje gebracht en ik heb je nog minder dronken gevoerd
2583098 oh neen je had me zoveel drank gegeven dat ik van de wereld niet meer wist waarom zo dat jij ongestoord je gangetje kon gaan en ik dit nooit te weten zou komen
2583099 we willen dit allebei ik weet dat jij mij wil en dat je naar me verlangt wel ik verlang naar jou
2583100 vicky wordt nu eens even wat rustig en ga nu even zitten ik denk namelijk dat ik enkele dingen zeer duidelijk moet stellen
2583101 wat ga je mij zeggen ga je blijven ontkennen dat je mij eigenlijk wel ziet zitten maar dat je reputatie je blijkbaar tegenhoudt en je liever stiekem aan mij zit
2583102 in de eerste plaats wil ik je melden dat ik je een heel leuke meid vind
2583103 maar niets meer vicky jij bent niet alleen een studente van mij je bent ook veel te jong ik wil geen relatie met een jong meisje en trouwens
2583104 vicky ik ben niet verliefd op jou en ik zal dat ook nooit zijn het spijt me maar ik hoop wel dat onze goede band als leraar en leerling kan blijven verder bestaan
2583105 een band als leraar en leerling zie je onze relatie zo
2583106 ja want dat is ook de enige relatie die er tussen ons is
2583107 oh alleen maar een leraar en leerling relatie en hoe noem jij het dan als je mij dronken voert en daarna aan mij zit te prutsen vind jij dat dan normaal in de relatie tussen een leraar en zijn leerlingen
2583108 ik heb helemaal niet aan je zitten prutsen vicky ik weet niet wat jij van me denkt maar ik heb je alleen maar gered uit de klauwen van neil hij was het die smerige dingen met je
2583109 ik vind je trouwens ongelooflijk laf dat je de schuld in de schoenen van iemand anders wilt schuiven er is hier maar n iemand de viezerik en dat ben jij
2583110 vicky we kunnen er toch als normale mensen over praten
2583111 ik ben benieuwd wat edward voor ons in petto heeft
2583112 ik ook ik ook ik blijf die stylist maar een raar kereltje vinden maar hij zal vast wel goede idee n hebben
2583113 ja maar hij kiest er blijkbaar wel de dure boetieks uit
2583114 italo ros is inderdaad niet n van de goedkoopste maar hij levert dan ook unieke stukken
2583115 hij is nog steeds even raar als de eerste keer dat ik hem zag
2583116 het lijkt mij dat het vooral sophie is die alles doet om in de belangstelling te staan
2583117 kom toch binnen meiden voor heel even is dit jullie terrein ik heb italo gevraagd om voor iedereen een prachtige outfit klaar te stomen en ik moet eerlijk zegen hij heeft er echt zijn werk van gemaakt voor sophie heeft hij trouwens een echt pronkstuk
2583118 jij verdient trouwens niets anders het blijft trouwens niet alleen bij die jurk ik heb ook nog een afspraak gemaakt bij de kapper hier even verderop voor je gemaakt vandaag krijg je een complete restyling
2583119 allemaal goed en wel maar ik denk dat dit toch echt allemaal een beetje boven mijn budget gaat
2583120 oh maar daar hoef je je toch geen zorgen om te maken jouw renzo verdient toch centjes genoeg en komt daar nog bij dat ik mogelijk enkel sponsorcontracten voor jou in de wacht kan slepen
2583121 zij in de spotlights zij op elke cover van elk tijdschrift dat kan zomaar niet en dat zal ik ook niet laten gebeuren
2583122 jongens en meisjes die nog niet op hun plaats zitten mag ik jullie verzoeken om plaats te nemen
2583123 goed dank jullie wel zoals jullie zien ben ik hier vandaag niet alleen de directrice is er hier bij en deze heeft jullie een mededeling te doen
2583124 als dat knappe gezelschap van jou een plaatsje zoekt in de klas dan ben ik zeker dat pol zijn plaatsje wel zal afstaan
2583125 jongens en meisjes mag ik jullie voorstellen aan anita dominguez
2583126 mag ik toch even vragen om alle opmerkingen achterwege te laten en mij te laten uitspreken
2583127 juffrouw dominguez is niet jullie nieuwe klasgenoot de plaats van juffrouw dominguez is vooraan in de klas
2583128 na het toch wel plotse vertrek van mevrouw kendy de lerares engels die zich vele jaren voor deze school heeft ingezet maar besloten heeft om met haar gezin een nieuw leven te beginnen in zuveringh wij betreuren de beslissing van mevrouw kendy maar tevens hebben we haar ook heel veel succes toe gewenst de tijd blijft natuurlijk niet stilstaan en dus hebben we sinds de bekendmaking van mevrouw kendys vertrek meteen gezocht naar een waardige opvolger
2583129 en die heeft ze gevonden het zal alleszins een mooi zicht zijn zo vooraan inde klas misschien zelfs nog een beter zicht dan voordien
2583130 eigenlijk was ik uitgepraat meneer de vliegher ik hoop dat jullie juffrouw dominguez een eerlijke kans gaan geven want als ze ook maar n klacht heeft dan verwacht ik dat ze diegene meteen naar mijn bureau stuurt en dan zal er wat zwaaien ik wil onze nieuwe aanwinst binnen het lerarenkorps heel veel succes toewensen en ik dank jullie voor jullie aandacht
2583131 ga jij nu les geven of zal juffrouw dominguez ons les gaan geven
2583132 het eerste uur hebben jullie zoals altijd op maandag nederlands en wie is de leraar nederlands juist ja ik anita excuseer mevrouw dominguez gaat deze les volgen zodatze jullie alvast wat beter kan leren kennen ze is namelijk niet alleen als docente engels de vervangster van mevrouw kendy maar ook als jullie klastitularis
2583133 misschien moet ik mij toch maar even wat uitgebreider aan jullie voorstellen als meneer hoogwaart dat goed vind
2583134 dat vind ik geen enkel probleem ga gerust uw gang juffrouw dominguez
2583135 waarom zet je gunther wederom in de spits met alle respect voor jou gunther maar een spits ben je niet
2583136 hoe vaak wat ik kan gewoon niet begrijpen dat je de foute keuzes blijft opstapelen hoe wil je hogerop geraken in het klassement als
2583137 blijkbaar heb je het erg moeilijk met kritiek maar dat weten we al langer dan vandaag je maakt gewoon verkeerde beslissingen en ik ben niet de enige die er zo over denkt
2583138 oh ja wie dan nog wie denkt er nog dat ik de foute keuzes maak
2583139 wil je dat ik de hele ploeg vraag om daar eerlijk op te antwoorden ik denk dat er hier een hele hoop handen de lucht in zullen gaan het zijn trouwens niet alleen de spelers de pers begint ook steeds smalender over ons te doen ik krijg het harder dan ooit te verduren in de krant maar wat kan ik er aan doen jij straft mij liever door mij enkele weken op de bank te plaatsen en ondertussen gaan we langzaam ten onder
2583140 ik dacht dat er toch enig vertrouwen tussen ons was dat wij vrienden waren maar jij maakt het mij absoluut niet gemakkelijk martin
2583141 het kan nochtans gemakkelijk gaan laat mij spelen en ik bewijs je dat ik het waard ben om in de spits te staan ik dacht dat wij vrienden waren waarom zet je mij dan elke keer op de bank
2583142 misschien omdat ik vind dat jij niet fit genoeg bent
2583143 ik niet fit komaan niet beginnen lullen ik ben sinds lang zo fit niet meer geweest
2583144 ik wil hier niets meer over horen mannen we beginnen te spelen en als het je niet zint martin verduin
2583145 je hebt er zelf om gevraagd bart jij komt voorlopig even naast mij staan want in plaats van zes tegen zes spelen we vijf tegen vijf
2583146 jij mag om te beginnen al enkele rondjes lopen doe er maar ineens vijf misschien vermoeit dat ook je scherpe tong een beetje
2583147 ik doe juist niets als jij mij als een klein kind blijft behandelen dan zal ik er zelf wel voor zorgen dat er wat aan gedaan wordt ik ga met onze voorzitter spreken want deze situatie wordt voor mij stilaan onhoudbaar
2583148 onze voorzitter heeft niets te maken met de sportieve beslissingen ik ben de coach dus ik beslis wie er speelt en wie niet
2583149 ja maar balthazar zal ook vast niet willen dat je zijn club kapot maakt
2583150 goed verduin zeg het eens waarmee kan ik je helpen
2583151 zeg voorzitter die man die hier zonet je bureau verliet kan het zijn dat ik die van ergens ken
2583152 oh ja tuurlijk frank van zee nu weet ik van waar ik hem kan kennen ik kijk regelmatig naar de nederlandse sportmagazines
2583153 martin daar kan ik niets over zeggen er zijn besprekingen met hem bezig maar waarover kan ik het niet hebben vertel jij nu maar eens wat ik voor je kan doen
2583154 koen moet je echt van sochtends met die muts over je hoofd rondlopen je jaagt mij de stuipen op het lijf
2583155 dat weet ik niet maar ik zou het enorm appreci ren wanneer je mijn naam niet noemt ik ben namelijk niet van plan om eens dit afgelopen is deze stad snel te verlaten
2583156 onder andere vanwege die twee ja het zijn de kindjes van mijn zus en die van hans nu hans er niet meer is zullen die kinderen een man in hun jonge leventje missen die rol wil ik voorlopig op mij nemen ik wil er voor hen staan en natuurlijk ook voor griet haar huwelijk met hans was misschien niet het perfecte huwelijk maar ondanks al het tumult en de problemen die er geweest zijn zagen zij elkaar graag zij zal nu tijd nodig hebben om alles te verwerken maar ze is ook iemand die niet graag alleen is vroeg of laat komt ze wel weer iemand tegen en hopelijk kan hij er dan ook staan voor sara en simon als is hun vader al is hans natuurlijk onvervangbaar
2583157 wat er met hans gebeurd is is een tragisch feit
2583158 en net daarom moest er iets gebeuren iemand is verantwoordelijk voor zijn dood
2583159 en jij acht die dokter verantwoordelijk daarom heb je zijn dochter ontvoerd sorry dat ik het zeg maar is het niet hans die zelf een einde aan zijn leven heeft gemaakt
2583160 ok ik zal dan alvast maar een goede pot stevige koffie zetten anders zal er van dat serieuze gesprek niet veel meer in huis komen
2583161 rachel ik neem de bar wel over als je wilt
2583162 ik heb de voorzitter beloofd om dit voor mij te houden maar ik kan dat niet ik moet het gewoon met iemand delen de hele club moet echter nog niet op de hoogte zijn want dat zal hermans mij zeker niet in dank afnemen
2583163 en wat denk je dat frank van zee bij de voorzitter kwam doen
2583164 dat lijkt mij toch erg duidelijk balthazar wil een nieuwe wind door de club laten waaien daarom moet arend jan natuurlijk plaats ruimen wat eigenlijk niet zo verwonderlijk is hoelang is het geleden dat we nog eens een match hebben gewonnen
2583165 dat ligt voornamelijk aan zijn beslissingen ja je gaat mij toch niet vertellen dat jij het met hem eens bent wij hebben een goed team maar wij spelen allemaal op een slechte positie of de verkeerde mensen worden op de verkeerde plaats gezet
2583166 en daarom denk je dat frank van zee in de plaats van arend jan komt
2583167 dan kan het toch even goed dat frank er gewoon was om te onderhandelen over nieuwe spelers misschien wil hermans zo die nieuwe wind wel laten waaien ik denk trouwens niet dat hij arend jan zomaar zal ontslaan je mag niet vergeten dat die twee al jaren vrienden zijn
2583168 dat dacht ik van a j en mezelf ook maar niets belet hem om mij op de bank te zetten als er n ding is dat ik intussen wel heb geleerd is dat je in de voetbalwereld geen vrienden hebt kennissen ja maar vrienden nee
2583169 dan heeft het geen zin dat ik een toast uitbreng op de vriendschap
2583170 ik vroeg of je dit uur geen les moest geven
2583171 euhm neen ik ben dit uur vrij eigenlijk nu ik er aan denk moet ik vandaag niet meer op school zijn
2583172 als er iets en ik zie dat er iets is dan moet je weten dat ik bereid ben om naar je te luisteren
2583173 ja maar we kennen elkaar toch nog niet zo lang ik kan je toch niet
2583174 wat kan je niet je diepste zielenroerselen bekend maken dat verlang ik toch ook niet ik wil alleen dat je weet dat ik voor je klaarsta ook al kennen we elkaar nog maar net
2583175 zien jullie niet dat het water aan het koken is en zijn jullie ook al doof het kooksignaal maakt anders wel voldoende lawaai
2583176 omdat zelfs een blinde kan zien wat er tussen jullie speelt jullie moeten dringend eens met elkaar praten en misschien wel meer
2583177 ik zeg niet dat jullie meteen met elkaar de koffer in moeten duiken
2583178 jullie zijn verliefd op elkaar doe er wat mee neem initiatief
2583179 na al die tijd zou je toch moeten weten dat ik geen thee lust maar een kopje koffie zou er wel ingaan
2583180 goed koffie dan met een wolkje melk en een half klontje suiker zo drink je het het liefst niet
2583181 jesse een whisky of neen maar er maar meteen een dubbele van en geen ijs
2583182 jullie voorzitter en ik hebben zo net een belangrijk gesprek gehad hij heeft een knoop doorgehakt en ik begrijp zijn beslissing niet
2583183 hermans vindt dat het tijd is voor verandering hij heeft mij aan de deur gezet al weken is hij bezig met een opvolger al weken was hij van plan om mij aan de kant te schuiven ik die al die jaren voor die club heb gevochten ik die er mijn ziel heb ingelegd na al die jaren mag ik gewoon oprotten schol bende pottenstampers
2583184 hey we saw you at the grocery store today you fell and we were very impressed with your recovery time good job
2583185 most importantly business users can obtain enterprise level support from sun but not just sun for either staroffice or openoffice
2583186 the business of supporting openoffice org and for that matter staroffice is in fact growing astonishingly fast around the world the mac element is pivotal too even in areas where you see few macs such as in india though that may be changing too
2583187 but the mac presence grants cios and others tasked with choosing the right software for their organizations the assurance and confidence that they can adopt the opendocument format our native format and the only published iso standard file format for office documents and have an office array that includes macs linux solaris windows and so on
2583188 in short openoffice org and the mac version in particular suture the wounds inflicted by 20 years of divergence the connecting thread is the file format and the understanding that what counts is creating communicating preserving files in a format that resists the fragility of monopoly and the reliance on any one company in fact there is a plugin that gives users the ability to read write odf and with open office 3 0 and staroffice 9 0 well have native support of ooxml which ms office 2007 uses
2583189 staroffice is pitched more to those who want the indemnification against suit by microsoft governments oems and to those who want the ease of having at one go the application plus the most useful extensions
2583190 its also more for those who wish to buy again at the outset the support services training that sun sells
2583191 but support services training are also available for openoffice org and many prefer it over staroffice because it may be in a language that staroffice is so far missing or because an officiating body has insisted that the license of the application be open staroffice is built with open source software same code as openoffice org but the license of the actual application is closed to make modifications one can easily download the corresponding openoffice org code and work with the community
2583192 numerous health safety and societal problems including reducing property values in affected neighborhoods and encouraging unsafe sex and aggressive attitudes toward women
2583193 they were telling lies about the industry that people were committing suicide and that drugs were rampant on the set
2583194 of course we had people from the set there to testify that those things are not happening

2583196 se est violando la ley con tal de apoyar proyectos que son contaminantes no hay respeto hacia la gente

2583200 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2583201 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
2583202 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2583203 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio
2583204 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
2583205 nosotros protegemos adoramos amamos e invocamos a la madre naturaleza y no permitiremos que sigan adelante con estos destrozos esto es un atropello del gobierno y esperamos que se presenten a darnos una explicaci n en el lugar afectado
2583206 lo que proponemos como alternativa es que la carretera pueda pasar por otra v a
2583207 nosotros no estamos en contra del camino porque es necesario pero queremos que se respeten los lugares sagrados
2583208 tierra que la forestales las adquirieron bajo leyes de la dictadura de pinochet a costa de negarle el derechos hist rico sobre la tierra a las comunidades mapuche
2583209 valorar lo alcanzado producto una lucha que muchos han pagados con c rceles y condena inesperada pero que nada es en vano por que la unidad de todas la luchas sociales en alg n momento de nuestra historia derrotara al sistema opresor neoliberal y pasada las elecciones municipales de octubre viviremos un chile distinto y nosotros la izquierda lo mapuche seguiremos avanzando en un proyecto de sociedad que contemple definitivamente nuestro territorio y autonom a

2583213 queda de manifiesto que se ha atentado a uno de los rewe correspondiente al territorio lafkenche lago budi por la carretera de la costa en la comuna de saavedra
2583214 por tanto se denuncia al estado y al gobierno de chile por no escuchar y hacer caso omiso a nuestras peticiones para evitar la construcci n de la carretera en nuestros espacios sagrados y la incapacidad de solucionar los graves problemas existentes en los diferentes territorios de nuestro pueblo
2583215 dejamos claro que no es tozudez de parte nuestra sino de los que provocan por cuanto anteriormente hab amos invitado a la autoridad comunal y gobierno regional a conversar en el espacio ceremonial rewe weicha el d a s bado 2 de agosto a las 13 00 horas no acudiendo ninguna de las autoridades mencionadas

2583227 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
2583228 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados

2583238 biiip bonjour vous tes bien sur la messagerie de delphine momentan ment absente pour cause de stress de d but de vacances dici son retour normalement programm lundi vous pouvez lui laisser un message
2583239 you know there are wonderful muslim americans all across the country who are doing wonderful things
2583240 and for this to be used as sort of an insult or to raise suspicions about me i think is unfortunate and its not what americas all about
2583241 obama blamed himself for not being forceful enough in challenging some of the rumors about him including that he is muslim
2583242 kill all the rich people break up their cars and apartments bring the revolution home kill your parents
2583243 im holding the entire democratic party responsible for the attacks on 9 11
2583244 but its just as important as the economy the economy and terrorism go together
2583245 its more offensive that our nation is forgetting about the attacks
2583246 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2583247 it is a big reversal only months ago obama was signaling a willingness to preserve public financing no wonder john mccain smelled a flip flop
2583248 tarnished his carefully honed image as a different kind of politician one who means what he says and says what he means while undercutting his call for a new kind of politics
2583249 is not only a huge blow to the watergate era campaign finance system but it could hurt the democratic nominees effort to paint himself as a reformer
2583250 for him to go outside this framework leaves him open to charges of hypocrisy
2583251 obamas description of public financing as broken is only half true
2583252 while the primary cycles public matching subsidies are broken and need updating for inflation the system for the general election is not
2583253 had an opportunity here to demonstrate that he really is a different kind of politician willing to put principles and the promises he has made above political calculation
2583254 do what politicians need to do but they ought to spare us the self congratulatory back patting while theyre doing it
2583255 if you are nominated for president in 2008 and your major opponents agree to forgo private funding in the general election campaign will you participate in the presidential public financing system
2583256 pledged last year to work aggressively with the republicans on a deal to preserve public financing under which candidates limit their spending in return for matching funds from the federal treasury
2583257 will have far reaching and extraordinary consequences that will weaken and undermine the public financing system
2583258 i think theres a very good chance that senator obama is on the democratic ticket in 2008 as the vice presidential nominee
2583259 have you ruled out running for another office before your term is up
2583260 theres been enormous speculation about your political future will you serve your six year term as united states senator from illinois

2583273 this isnt the tony rezko i knew but now he has been convicted by a jury on multiple charges that once again shine a spotlight on the need for reform
2583274 administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when it was unsubstantiated contradicted or even nonexistent
2583275 there has been some debate over how imminent a threat iraq poses i do believe iraq poses an imminent threat i also believe after september 11 that question is increasingly outdated to insist on further evidence could put some of our fellow americans at risk can we afford to take that chance i do not think we can
2583276 the reports essentially validate what we have been saying all along that policymakers statements were substantiated by the intelligence
2583277 and his aides built the public case for war against iraq by exaggerating available intelligence and by ignoring disagreements among spy agencies about iraqs weapons programs and saddam husseins links to al qaeda
2583278 the president and his advisers undertook a relentless public campaign in the aftermath of the attacks to use the war against al qaeda as a justification for overthrowing saddam hussein
2583279 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years we also should remember we have always underestimated the progress that saddam hussein has been able to make in the development of weapons of mass destruction
2583280 bill i support the presidents efforts to disarm saddam hussein i think he was right on in his speech tonight the lessons we learned following september 11 were that we cant wait to be attacked again particularly when it involves weapons of mass destruction so regrettably saddam has not done the right thing which is to disarm and were left with no alternative but to take action
2583281 we know he continues to attempt to gain access to additional capability including nuclear capability
2583282 saddam has ignored the mandates of the united nations is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them
2583283 with regard to iraq i agree iraq presents a genuine threat especially in the form of weapons of mass destruction chemical biological and potentially nuclear weapons i agree that saddam hussein is exceptionally dangerous and brutal if not uniquely so as the president argues
2583284 the weapons they iraq have are a threat to the world and mister president the world must respond
2583285 saddam hussein in effect has thumbed his nose at the world community and i think that the presidents approaching this in the right fashion
2583286 it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein will continue to increase his capability to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons should he succeed in that endeavor he could alter the political and security landscape of the middle east which as we know all too well affects american security
2583287 according to the cias report all u s intelligence experts agree that iraq is seeking nuclear weapons there is little question that saddam hussein wants to develop nuclear weapons
2583288 there is no question that iraq possesses biological and chemical weapons and that he seeks to acquire additional weapons of mass destruction including nuclear weapons that is not in debate
2583289 saddam hussein is an evil man a dictator who oppresses his people and flouts the mandate of the international community while this behavior is reprehensible it is husseins vigorous pursuit of biological chemical and nuclear weapons and his present and potential future support for terrorist acts and organizations that make him a terrible danger to the people to the united states
2583290 as a member of the house intelligence committee i am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
2583291 we must stop saddam from ever again jeopardizing the stability and security of his neighbors with weapons of mass destruction
2583292 the chemical weapons saddam has used and the biological weapons we know he has tested pay no attention to borders and nationalities
2583293 we should preserve our intelligence committee staff as a single unified staff that works for the committee as a whole under the supervision of the chairman and the vice chairman the minority apparently wishes to divide the committee staff for the first time in history into majority minority or partisan camps
2583294 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
2583295 tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another a journey that will bring a new and better day to america
2583296 tonight i can stand before you and say that i will be the democratic nominee for president of the united states
2583297 as barack obama has said before the idea of joint town halls is appealing and one that would allow a great conversation to take place about the need to change the direction of this country
2583298 we would recommend a format that is less structured and lengthier than the mccain campaign suggests one that more closely resembles the historic debates between abraham lincoln and stephen douglas
2583299 it annoys me when straight men assume those girl on girl snogs are all for them and i think its a pity when lesbians make the same assumption

2583304 which allows the products master outlet to sense when the computer has either been turned off or has gone into sleep mode so it can shut off power to unused peripherals plugged into the controlled outlets
2583305 most importantly business users can obtain enterprise level support from sun but not just sun for either staroffice or openoffice
2583306 the business of supporting openoffice org and for that matter staroffice is in fact growing astonishingly fast around the world the mac element is pivotal too even in areas where you see few macs such as in india though that may be changing too
2583307 but the mac presence grants cios and others tasked with choosing the right software for their organizations the assurance and confidence that they can adopt the opendocument format our native format and the only published iso standard file format for office documents and have an office array that includes macs linux solaris windows and so on
2583308 in short openoffice org and the mac version in particular suture the wounds inflicted by 20 years of divergence the connecting thread is the file format and the understanding that what counts is creating communicating preserving files in a format that resists the fragility of monopoly and the reliance on any one company in fact there is a plugin that gives users the ability to read write odf and with open office 3 0 and staroffice 9 0 well have native support of ooxml which ms office 2007 uses
2583309 staroffice is pitched more to those who want the indemnification against suit by microsoft governments oems and to those who want the ease of having at one go the application plus the most useful extensions
2583310 its also more for those who wish to buy again at the outset the support services training that sun sells
2583311 but support services training are also available for openoffice org and many prefer it over staroffice because it may be in a language that staroffice is so far missing or because an officiating body has insisted that the license of the application be open staroffice is built with open source software same code as openoffice org but the license of the actual application is closed to make modifications one can easily download the corresponding openoffice org code and work with the community

2583315 after the indra sahni case when weve had reservations for obcs in employment only 5 4 per cent of those seats have been fille d so until social inclusiveness is totally achieved i dont think its time yet to talking about leaving people out it may be a very attractive argument its also not true to say that it replaces merit
2583316 any backward class citizens not adequately represented in the services under the state
2583317 no doubt after the effective abolition of jagirdari and zamindari systems the condition of jats in rajasthan have begun to improve but considering the time span required for advancement of a community as a whole from a position of backwardness
2583318 being back here is like being caressed by my beginnings
2583319 when i was here i took it for granted now im not taking anything for granted
2583320 i loved his music he made us all laugh and sing into the wee hours of the night no matter where we were he was just a really joyous person
2583321 maybe he didnt know that he wasnt going to make it it came as a shock to me
2583322 he had the same sense of humor that his father had
2583323 he always came up with the strangest type of joke
2583324 al perrin at the end of the month is taking my canoe and hes going to florida
2583325 it got a lot of play around here and it also got a lot of play in florida because it was about the florida keys
2583326 it was fun because my friends would call up from all over the place because they had heard it
2583327 he just had a way of getting in your life and staying there nothing about erik would ever make one not want to have him as a friend
2583328 it was me a city girl coming to a small town
2583329 everybody knew everybody they had stories that went back years
2583330 i am blessed but it seemed like music and writing found me it wasnt anything i chose to do
2583331 it happened during the day two individuals saw it and they had enough time because it was visible for half an hour and they took video the trail persisted for quite some time
2583332 really at the heart of my concern is that we shouldnt wait for a definitive study to come out but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later
2583333 we found no overall increased risk of brain tumors among cellular phone users the potential elevated risk of brain tumors after long term cellular phone use awaits confirmation by future studies
2583334 if there is a risk from these products and at this point we do not know that there is it is probably very small
2583335 growing body of literature linking long term cell phone use to possible adverse health effects including cancer
2583336 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
2583337 the question is do you want to play russian roulette with your brain
2583338 i dont know that cell phones are dangerous but i dont know that they are safe
2583339 the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users
2583340 we certainly dont know of any mechanism by which radiofrequency exposure would cause a cancerous effect in cells we just dont know this might possibly occur
2583341 by all means if a person feels compelled that they should take precautions in reducing the amount of electromagnetic radio waves through their bodies by all means they should do so
2583342 but at the same time we have to remember theres no conclusive evidence that links cell phones to cancer whether its brain tumors or other forms of cancer
2583343 when you look at the overwhelming majority of studies that have been peer reviewed and published in scientific journals around the world youll find no relationship between wireless usage and adverse health affects
2583344 i dont want to get it brain cancer and i certainly dont want you to get it
2583345 i think if they gave me specific numbers and specific information and it was scary enough i would be concerned
2583346 without specific numbers its too vague to get me worked up
2583347 i happen to have been privileged enough to be in on the fact that weve been visited on this planet and the ufo phenomena is real
2583348 its been well covered up by all our governments for the last 60 years or so but slowly its leaked out and some of us have been privileged to have been briefed on some of it
2583349 ive been in military and intelligence circles who know that beneath the surface of what has been public knowledge yes we have been visited reading the papers recently its been happening quite a bit
2583350 this is really starting to open up i think were headed for real disclosure and some serious organisations are moving in that direction
2583351 i thought id stumbled on some sort of astronaut humour but he was absolutely serious that aliens are definitely out there and theres no debating it
2583352 nasa does not track ufos nasa is not involved in any sort of cover up about alien life on this planet or anywhere in the universe

2583362 this is an astounding development it is a seminal event
2583363 no democratic or moral authority to sign britain up to the renamed eu constitution
2583364 a total breach of trust with the british people and a flagrant breach of his solemn election promise to the british people
2583365 joining in the ugly bullying of the irish people who have clearly rejected this treaty
2583366 in britains interest to be at the heart of europe and its in europes interest that britain should play a leading part
2583367 since both houses of parliament voted by substantial majorities in favour of it
2583368 the tories are playing games and engaging in political stunts as usual the fact is that the tories cannot be trusted to safeguard britains interests in europe
2583369 all previous attempts to base money solely on intangibles such as credit or government edict or fiat have ended in inflationary panic and disaster
2583370 it is deeply hypocritical that they should be lavishing course after course on world leaders when there is a food crisis and millions cannot afford a decent meal to eat
2583371 if the g8 wants to betray the hopes of a generation of children it is going the right way about it the food crisis is an emergency and the g8 must treat it as that
2583372 the g8 have made a bad start to their summit with excessive cost and lavish consumption
2583373 surely it is not unreasonable for each leader to give a guarantee that they will stand by their solemn pledges of three years ago at gleneagles to help the worlds poor all of us are watching waiting and listening
2583374 we need a global plan to deal with rising food prices that are affecting millions of families in britain thats why i am proposing that we take action to both increase the global supply of food and reduce unnecessary demand
2583375 if we are to get food prices down we must also do more to deal with unnecessary demand such as by all of us doing more to cut our food waste which is costing the average household in britain around 8 per week
2583376 i enjoy taking pictures of skylines and i have a few different cameras when i got out taking pictures i always take a few different shots with all of them
2583377 i have lots of photos with objects like this in them and they are all taken at different times and locations using different cameras so it cant possibly be something on the lens
2583378 the strangest thing is that you cannot see these objects with the naked eye but they show up on the pictures and are even reflected in the water in some shots
2583379 it is very unnerving as i have no idea what they are and it makes me wonder if we are being watched i know that most people think it is a mad theory and that it can be explained away but i know what i saw
2583380 i have no idea what they were but i have seen them and photographed them on a few occasions all at around the same time of night they really are weird
2583381 they are undemocratic they are removing peoples freedom they dont respect individual rights they are censoring information

2583386 they want a place where we can eat somali food and just to be

2583389 theres nothing specific or different about the somali workers that i note
2583390 this is a town thats home to 26 nationalities we never bothered to do the statistics or research ourselves but generally speaking weve always had many different people from many different backgrounds
2583391 the right people who could appreciate and enjoy this type of work
2583392 they kind of mingle among themselves and they dont bother anybody
2583393 some of them have left because they dont like slaughterhouses but a lot of them have decided to stay for now
2583394 but we all need to make sure this is long term so far so good we came here because they were hiring quickly and i stay here as long as i can keep my hours

2583500 the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course
2583501 the us should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course it has chosen we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia

2583506 hai orang orang yang beriman taatilah alloh dan taatilah rosul nya dan ulil amri di antara kamu kemudian jika kamu berlainan pendapat tentang sesuatu maka kembalikanlah ia kepada alloh al quran dan rosul sunnahnya jika kamu benar benar beriman kepada alloh dan hari kemudian yang demikian itu lebih utama bagimu dan lebih baik akibatnya
2583507 syaikh dr ibrahim bin amir ar ruhaily berkata tentang yayasan ihyaut turats
2583508 hai orang orang yang beriman taatilah alloh dan taatilah rosul nya dan ulil amri di antara kamu kemudian jika kamu berlainan pendapat tentang sesuatu maka kembalikanlah ia kepada alloh al quran dan rosul sunnahnya jika kamu benar benar beriman kepada allah dan hari kemudian yang demikian itu lebih utama bagimu dan lebih baik akibatnya
2583509 dan apabila datang kepada mereka suatu berita tentang keamanan atau pun ketakutan mereka lalu menyiarkannya dan kalau mereka menyerahkannya kepada rosul dan ulil amri di antara mereka tentulah orang orang yang ingin mengetahui kebenarannya akan dapat mengetahuinya dari mereka rosul dan ulil amri kalau tidaklah karena karunia dan rahmat allah kepada kamu tentulah kamu mengikut setan kecuali sebahagian kecil saja di antaramu
2583510 barang siapa yang mentaatiku berarti ia telah mentaati alloh dan barang siapa yang mendurhakai perintahku maka berarti ia telah mendurhakai alloh barang siapa yang mematuhi pemimpin berarti ia telah mematuhiku dan barang siapa yang mendurhakai pemimpin berarti ia telah mendurhakaiku
2583511 kewajiban seorang muslim adalah mendengar dan taat dalam melakukan perintah yang disukai atau pun tidak disukai kecuali bila diperintahkan melakukan maksiat bila dia diperintah melakukan maksiat maka tidak ada kewajiban untuk mendengar serta taat
2583512 jika kalian memasukinya maka kalian akan tetap berada di dalamnya sampai hari kiamat
2583513 tidak ada kewajiban taat dalam berbuat maksiat kepada alloh sesungguhnya taat itu hanya untuk kebajikan
2583514 orang orang banyak yang bertanya kepada rosululloh shollallohu alahih wa sallam tentang kebajikan sedangkan aku justru bertanya kepada beliau tentang kejahatan karena takut aku terjerumus melakukannya maka aku bertanya
2583515 wahai rosululloh sesungguhnya kami pernah mengalami zaman jahiliah dan kejahatan lalu datanglah alloh dengan membawa kebaikan ini kepada kami apakah setelah kebajikan ini nanti akan ada lagi kejahatan
2583516 akan ada suatu kaum yang mengikuti selain sunahku serta memberikan petunjuk dengan selain petunjukku di antara mereka ada yang kamu kenal juga ada yang tidak kamu kenal
2583517 ya kelak akan muncul para dai yang berada di muka pintu pintu neraka jahanam siapa yang menuruti panggilan mereka akan mereka lemparkan ke dalamnya
2583518 baiklah mereka adalah kaum yang kulitnya sama dengan kita dan berbicara dengan bahasa kita
2583519 maka jauhilah semua sekte sekte yang ada itu meskipun kamu harus menggigit pangkal pohon sampai maut menjemputmu kamu tetap demikian
2583520 barang siapa yang tidak menyukai sesuatu pada pemimpinnya maka hendaklah ia bersabar karena sesungguhnya siapa yang memisahkan diri dari jamaah walau sejengkal lalu ia mati maka kematiannya adalah kematian jahiliah
2583521 rosululloh sholallahu alaihi wa sallam pernah menasihati kami dengan nasihat yang menggetarkan hati dan mencucurkan air mata
2583522 wahai rosululloh seperti ini adalah nasihat perpisahan karena itu berilah kami nasihat
2583523 aku wasiatkan kepada kalian untuk tetap menjaga ketakwaan kepada alloh azza wa jalla tunduk taat kepada pemimpin meskipun kalian dipimpin oleh seorang budak habsyi karena orang orang yang hidup sesudahku akan melihat berbagai perselisihan hendaklah kalian berpegang teguh kepada sunnah khulafaur rasyidin yang diberi petunjuk alloh peganglah kuat kuat sunnah itu dengan gigi geraham dan jauhilah ajaran ajaran yang baru dalam agama karena semua bidah adalah sesat
2583524 barangsiapa yang mengacungkan senjata kepada kami maka dia bukan golongan kami
2583525 ya rosululloh kami tidak bertanya padamu tentang sikap terhadap penguasa penguasa yang bertaqwa baik akan tetapi penguasa yang melakukan ini dan itu disebutkan kejelekan kejelekan
2583526 karena kemarahan dan ketamakan sebenarnya dia telah menempatkan islam pada tempatnya namun ia dipengaruhi oleh orang orang hingga membuatnya tamak dia juga memiliki kasih sayang dan berani menegakkan kebenaran namun dia menghukumi utsman berdasarkan lahirnya belaka

2583529 menyatakan secara terang terangan memberontak berkata kata jahat seperti telah dilakukan oleh jabalah terhadap utsman bin affan pada tahun 35 hijriyah dan mengangkat senjata kepada pemerintahan kaum muslimin
2583530 mengatakan bahwa pemimpin sulthon di negeri ini telah kafir murtad keluar dari islam
2583531 menghalalkan darah pemimpin negeri ini sebagaimana kaum khawarij menghalalkan darah utsman bin affan pada tahun 35 hijriyah
2583532 dan sesungguhnya kami telah mengutus rosul pada tiap tiap umat untuk menyerukan sembahlah alloh saja dan jauhilah thoghut itu maka di antara umat itu ada orang orang yang diberi petunjuk oleh alloh dan ada pula di antaranya orang orang yang telah pasti kesesatan baginya maka berjalanlah kamu di muka bumi dan perhatikanlah bagaimana kesudahan orang orang yang mendustakan para rosul

2583616 with teammates ringing the turf war area the participants cannot escape scrutiny yesterdays first one on one drills of the five day old training camp had bragging and ragging rights at stake
2583617 defensive tackle josh leonard set the tone by speed rushing past center matagisila lefiti to touch the tackling dummy which served as the finish line right tackle keoni steinhoff and defensive left end david veikune dueled for four seconds the most animated matchup was between left tackle laupepa letuli and defensive right end elliott purcell they refused to disengage and then when they did both came out swinging
2583618 weve got a bunch of tough mothers thats who you want to go to battle with we had a couple of little skirmishes i like that right now id rather pull them apart than have to push them the other way weve got some emotional players and some passionate players and i like that thats why i like coaching here

2583621 estes blocked well against two of the toughest interior pass rushers defensive tackles keala
2583622 im going to let my personality drift over to the offense we have to be a bunch of tough mothers ill try to stay away from the quarterbacks they have their own personality

2583624 im glad greg actually went down and spoke to them i dont think theres any doubt that we agree with what he said

2583626 im blessed now that we have a kid together i have to take care of my family everything falls into place now that football is here and family is here i just love it i love it
2583627 its fine i didnt pull it so im just going to take a couple of days off and be ready to go hopefully its pretty sore but i have good strength in it and its just a matter of getting it stretched and loosening it up
2583628 unfortunately adam got hurt it doesnt mean that ill be there ill just take my time and make sure im ready so if it does happen in the game ill make sure ill be there
2583629 doing a good job every day out here and im excited for him i know hes a good player and no matter what happens during the season if anyone gets injured we have great linebackers who can step in and play great for us
2583630 i consider r j a starter hes just as good as all of us hes probably the strongest linebacker we have
2583631 hes a really mellow guy he has a great work ethic he inspires others
2583632 we dont see it as a competition between me and him were family and we try to push each other if i go down i know my cousin has my back and hes going to step right in there and do great
2583633 its always good to have a new member of the family steph is a great girl and r j s baby is cute hes a big boy
2583634 i didnt tell her but i told her to take a picture under the mistletoe and while she was looking up at it i proposed to her and we kissed under the mistletoe i had to do the whole nine yards i made sure i did it right it was a blessed moment
2583635 the swamp theres nothing like it youre challenging the conditions i have to work my game up so we wont miss a beat in spring youre getting to know the new plays and then in fall you just have to be ready its a whole different level
2583636 it just shows how deep we are i have full confidence in him tyson kafentzis and brashton satele to step in at any point in the season and there will be no fall off
2583637 also getting first team reps were guard raphael ieru in place of lafu tuioti mariner calf and defensive end elliott purcell for john fonoti hamstring first team cornerbacks ryan mouton and jameel dowling also had classes in the morning before mouton made it out for the latter portion of practice calvin roberts and jopierre davis were the first corners in the rotation
2583638 thats one of our big deals we want to graduate our students were working hard to make sure they understand that they dont have to feel guilty about going to class well make it up on the football side of it
2583639 its a lot better now that ive fixed my hamstring i can actually hunker down a little bit last spring id just get bullrushed every time because i didnt have legs when youre in the team period youre going to try your hardest but when its one on one you know everyones watching people on the hill coaches everyone on the line theyre all watching you
2583640 i would say hes the focal point of our offense hes who we all circle around hes a great player hes a quiet leader and hes very well respected when hes in there were a whole different offense he sets the tone
2583641 its going to keep getting tighter those two are going to get a lot of reps im planning on playing all three of those tackles were planning on going to florida with eight to 10 linemen ready to play letulis had a real good start of camp well keep pushing him and getting him reps and keep him learning he should be a big time contributor for us
2583642 smith also pointed to junior ray hisatake as one who enjoyed a solid day hisatake began camp in the tackle race but smith said hes adapted well in moving to guard this week
2583643 last year leonard arrived on campus planning to play defensive end and weighed in at 265 he was moved inside to tackle where he posted 21 2 sacks and recovered three fumbles this summer he concentrated on putting on weight checking in at 305 to hold up better against double teams he said training at velocity sports performance in sacramento calif helped him maintain quickness while carrying more weight
2583644 i just ate a lot of meals a lot of protein shakes ate burger king every day i was recruited for d end never played inside before so when they shoved me inside it was a new thing because i used to one on ones instead of being double teamed now ive got a year under my belt to get used to that
2583645 the offensive lineman have really improved their technique and fundamentals i give brian smith a lot of credit hes getting those guys going thats a competitive drill we had to pull some guys off of each other which is just what i want i dont want to have to push them together id rather pull them apart
2583646 he was pretty much the first freshman i met when i got here im pretty sure were going to be growing up with that position for the next few years we sit next to each other in meetings everything and during practice when we see 7 on 7 and everything we talk try to figure out what the coverage is and try to correlate what were supposed to do in certain situations
2583647 i think one thing these guys have is theyre all bright young kids including kawika ornellas 5 9 170 mililani hs theyve gotta pick up what we do a lot faster than most people just physically they gotta continue to get better and their time will come
2583648 every day for advice no matter what they open up for questions no matter what i have to say they always help me out if they see something wrong they try to fix it its just kind of like another coach out there
2583649 theyre very good players but these young kids are very smart theyre coachable theyre talented and theyre gonna be the future but the future may not be right now
2583650 i feel the whole special teams unit is light years ahead of where we were last year last year was kind of a learning process getting used to holder punter tim grasso getting used to jake ingram this year it seems like were exactly where we left off and were in midseason form

2583749 well just have to see but im sure it will great and it must be a lot because were going to stay here for at least another night

2583753 probably a offering room because of the treasure the deity figure and the fact that this room was hidden behind a flap of moss that blended in with the ridge of earth
2583754 i found the room by mistake actually i was walking out of the cavern with my filled sack of goods then i tripped to the right and noticed the flap of moss into the room the rest is self explanatory
2583755 that has got to be the luckiest accident of all time
2583756 it doesnt seem like it would be a switch to activate a booby trap seeing as how no one would think that the flap of moss outside was the entrance way leading to this room
2583757 could be a switch that once pulled will open a door leading to someplace interesting

2583790 good science is all about replication but it is hard to see how science will ever replicate this
2583791 it is reasonable to assume that persons with relatively high daily energy expenditures would be less likely to gain weight over time compared with those who have low energy expenditures so far data to support this hypothesis are not particularly compelling

2583800 okay so what question do you have about our program
2583801 no we do not record drop off ups packages so if you personally do not ship a package out of our computer then there will be no end of day slip
2583802 those are monicas packages she works upstairs she knows theyre there brent will probably bring his truck around and pick them up so dont worry about it
2583803 they deliver in the morning so vicki lets them in
2583804 ups or fedex whoever delivers but it doesnt really matter who the delivery person was im sure brent or monica will pick them up so you can just ignore them you dont have to do anything with those packages

2583811 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2583812 the right way for the open minded enquirer to approach the question of gods existence is to look for grounds or reasons or evidence for thinking that god does exist then to do the same for thinking that he does not exist and finally to perform a metaphorical subtraction of one from the other this will then yield the net grounds or the grounds all things considered for believing that god does or does not exist
2583813 supererogatory acts are morally right alternatives that are morally better than other alternatives that are also right any morally perfect agent would do whatever is supererogatory at every opportunity because this would be the morally best course of action and morally perfect conduct could not be improved upon
2583814 if a being suffers there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering of any other being
2583815 man first of all is the being who hurls himself toward a future and who is conscious of imagining himself as being in the future man is at the start a plan which is aware of itself rather than a patch of moss a piece of garbage or a cauliflower nothing exists prior to this plan there is nothing in heaven man will be what he will have planned to be
2583816 we just cant know what god is really like or how everything makes sense from his perspective
2583817 i know that my brutally murdering dozens of people seems wicked but in the cosmic scheme of things what i did actually works out for the greater good in ways that we cant see the tortures and deaths of all of those people will actually create greater goods in the world and avoid worse evils so i should be judged as doing something virtuous and praiseworthy
2583818 its possible that what hitler did was really a good thing we just cant understand how with our limited intellects
2583819 its possible that every single one of the 240 000 people who died in the thailand tsunami deserved a violent wrenching death by battery and drowning

2583845 russian troops russian tanks that moved into south ossetia on their way expelled the whole ethnically georgian population of south ossetia
2583846 theyve committed as of this morning ethnic cleansing in all areas they control in south ossetia
2583847 russian forces have been specifically targeting civilian quarters they specifically attacked and blew up the whole civilian quarter in the town of gori far away from the place where the conflict area is and where direct friction between forces is
2583848 they attacked civilian installations in the western part of georgia theyve attacked residential quarters all around the country theyve attacked civilian hospitals and most of the casualties are among civilians
2583849 close to the artillery base located near the entrance to the city we saw a dreadful sight
2583850 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected

2583884 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2583885 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2583886 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2583887 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2583888 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2583889 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2583892 george wilson and melanie edwards of australian wildlife services have just published a paper in the early view section of conservation letters entitled native wildlife on rangelands to minimize methane and produce lower emission meat kangaroos versus livestock
2583893 ruminant livestock produce the greenhouse gas methane and so contribute to global warming and biodiversity reduction methane from the foregut of cattle and sheep constitutes 11 of australias total greenhouse gas emissions ghg kangaroos on the other hand are nonruminant forestomach fermenters that produce negligible amounts of methane we quantified the ghg savings australia could make if livestock were reduced on the rangelands where kangaroo harvesting occurs and kangaroo numbers increased to 175 million to produce same amount of meat removing 7 million cattle and 36 million sheep by 2020 would lower australias ghg emissions by 16 megatonnes or 3 of australias annual emissions however the change will require large cultural and social adjustments and reinvestment trials are underway based on international experiences of managing free ranging species they are enabling collaboration between farmers and if they also show benefits to sustainability rural productivity and conservation of biodiversity they could be expanded to incorporate change on the scale of this article farmers have few options to reduce the contribution that livestock make to ghg production using kangaroos to produce low emission meat is an option for the australian rangelands which would avoid permit fees under australias emissions trading scheme and could even have global application

2583922 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2583923 the waraos told us it was because there were too many bats that were biting the children
2583924 none of the treatments studied had any significant benefit over no treatment at all
2583925 its not in the realm that you would expect it to be if these interventions were really performing
2583926 we dont expect that a provider is going to know everything about every nationality
2583927 the critical thing here is developing sensitivity and the understanding that not every culture responds to medical providers in the same way sees medicine in the same way
2583928 from our peoples point of view were offending the doctors because theyre the experts as far as modern contemporary medicine
2583929 some doctors may think oh my goodness what happened to the babys butt
2583930 but the doctor understood thats just how asians are if the physician already knows about it if they are aware that certain races have certain characteristics then they dont have any doubts
2583931 ive heard people speak of it as a level of humility about understanding different cultures thats quite appropriate

2583933 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2583934 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2583935 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2583936 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2583937 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2583938 they told me that i was a hero and that they wished they could do the same in their countries
2583939 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2583940 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2583941 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2583942 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2583943 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2583944 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2583945 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2583946 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2583947 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men

2583964 the cdc is committed to ensuring that its resources are going to the populations hardest hit by the epidemic

2583970 there are more people arriving at the ers and there are fewer ers
2583971 it takes me a month to get an appointment for my own doctor and im a physician for gods sake
2583972 half of people had waiting times of 31 minutes or less
2583973 the er has become the front door to the hospital
2583974 millions more people each year are seeking emergency care but emergency departments are continuing to close often because so much care goes uncompensated
2583975 this report is very troubling because it shows that care is being delayed for everyone including people in pain and with heart attacks

2583978 an enemy in the fort is far more dangerous than one outside
2583979 i am judicially dead but the old nature is alive and therefore if i dont keep my body under and crucify the flesh with its affections this lower nature will gain the advantage and i would be in bondage
2583980 but when the tempter gets the mastery over me i am its slave and it is a source of weakness it may be made a great power for good all through my life and help me or it may become my greatest enemy from within and rob me of power
2583981 many christians said an old divine who bore the loss of a child or all their property with the most heroic christian fortitude are entirely vanquished by the breaking of a dish or the blunders of a servant
2583982 christianity isnt worth a snap of your fingers if it doesnt straighten out your character i have got tired of all mere gush and sentiment
2583983 the reason that many a man has no power is that there is some cursed sin covered up there will not be a drop of dew until that sin is brought to light
2583984 it is said of william wilberforce that a friend once found him in the greatest agitation looking for a dispatch he had mislaid for which one of the royal family was waiting just then as if to make it still more trying a disturbance was heard in the nursery
2583985 when christ has the first place in your heart you are going to get victory just do whatever you know will please him
2583986 turn a moment to the song of solomon the second chapter fifteenth verse take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines for our vines have tender grapes
2583987 it think it would be a good thing if we had a little of the old fashioned kind of persecution just now it would bring out the strongest of characters and make us all healthier
2583988 make up your mind to this if the world has nothing to say against you jesus christ will have nothing to say for you
2583989 we dont know where the losses are and some wont come out until companies report which will probably be the quarter end september
2583990 banks have had to pay more for the money that we borrow right now the banks and the big banks are doing exactly the right thing by the customers and the economy
2583991 there are other ways we can make margins on this we will try to do the right thing around our customers
2583992 if the market settles then it would be a smaller number that is passed on to borrowers
2583993 unemployment is very low a lot is export driven so perhaps the us slows to a point it goes into a recession
2583994 even doing that we will see at the very worst australia slowing a little bit but perhaps not at all because the economy is in great shape
2583995 i think it will be 1 2 3 red white and blue on the podium
2583996 weve been training four years for this we are just confident in ourselves and in our training
2583997 i think you need to change what you write about
2583998 the first couple days training here it was just kind of like whoa but today maybe the air was a little bit thinner it wasnt crazy bad for us
2583999 the conditions were just so humid and so hot it was just a real war of attrition today
2584000 will they be able to perform up to the level of their conditioning given the pollution its less about long term health risks thats not the issue
2584001 we tried very hard to work out in the worst part of the day and we stayed out there when it was hottest
2584002 when we initially left we got to the lights and i said to him have you still got the piece with you he said no
2584003 so we drove back got the piece delivered him to the hospital and they reattached it
2584004 he was losing a bit of blood as you do with the nerves that run into the tips of your fingers i made sure he was well and he was looked after
2584005 they were really helpful and pleasant and kept the guy calm
2584006 just done what anyone else would do which is pretty much help someone who needed a bit of help
2584007 i had no idea when you interviewed me that you considered much of my later work to be sentimental rubbish or that you thought songs like uptown girl and we didnt start the fire were abominations and your back slapping buddy buddy style of conversation betrayed no indication that you actually compared talking with me to sleeping with an inflatable girlfriend
2584008 you didnt bring any of this up during the interview and i certainly would have welcomed the opportunity to discuss those kinds of things person to person
2584009 had i known you felt this way i still would have done the bloody interview but your comments reveal you to be already critically predisposed and somewhat insincere you are still welcome to attend our concert in auckland but just as a safety precaution please wear a hockey mask
2584010 ive had letters before from the bass player in some local band who is pissed off because i said his record is crap but ive never had a letter from someone in the big league before its actually made him go up in my estimation
2584011 he just wants respect for his work and i think good on him for making direct contact he was great to talk to and no matter what i think of those songs other people clearly love them because hes sold over 150 million records
2584012 he was undefeated in 21 fights so i do feel fortunate that im not living in new york so he cant come around and smack me one
2584013 in an interesting development in a texas case against a college age defendant who was 16 at the time of the infringement the judge has
2584014 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2584015 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2584016 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2584017 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2584018 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2584019 im filing a 10 million libel action and i dont think you want ap to be part of that
2584020 its a story of courage of a very brave service dog taking care of me he passed away i was so depressed i had him cloned
2584021 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to

2584028 a scandalous look at scandinavia where women are women and men are too
2584029 the men speak about a vague almost inchoate experience of victimization
2584030 we end up relating to women in a way that is more like woman to woman not man to woman we are feminized in our relationships and they dont last
2584031 in twenty years mens dominance will be broken and women will have more power in society there will be more female ceos and the wage gap will favour women
2584032 there will soon be a large collective of uneducated low paid men who dont have any friends and are unmarried and alone as well as uninteresting for women looking for a relationship
2584033 this is already happening but the problem is beginning to accelerate this is a huge danger for men
2584034 the power of the patriarchy is so great that education and similar factors are not so important
2584035 other things play a bigger role such as short cuts and networks for example
2584036 there will soon be a large collective of uneducated low paid men who dont have any friends and are unmarried and alone as well as uninteresting for women looking for a relationship

2584040 put him more closely in line with the moral clarity and american exceptionalism projected by president bushs first term
2584041 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2584042 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2584043 what is clear is that russia has invaded georgias sovereign has encroached on georgias sovereignty
2584044 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2584045 the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
2584046 sen mccain is clearly willing to note who he thinks is the aggressor here
2584047 i dont think you can excuse defend explain or make allowance for russian behavior because of what is going on in georgia
2584048 thats kind of like saying after saddam hussein invaded kuwait that kuwait and iraq need to show restraint or like saying in 1968 when the soviet union invaded czechoslovakia that the czechoslovaks should show restraint
2584049 the fact that we have to deal with russia to deal with our most important national security challenges
2584050 the temperature of your rhetoric isnt a measure of your commitment to georgian sovereignty
2584051 you dont want to get so far in front of a situation that youre feeding the momentum of an escalation
2584052 mccain took an inflexible approach to addressing this issue by focusing heavily on one side without a pragmatic assessment of the situation
2584053 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2584054 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government

2584057 i wish that those involved would refrain from bad mouthing my sister
2584058 in the first reaction from hunters family her younger sister melissa told abc news that edwards should immediately follow through on his pledge to take a paternity test
2584059 melissa said rielle was being falsely portrayed as a promiscuous person and was not involved in setting up edwards at the hotel meeting
2584060 she is a good and honest person the sweetest and most caring woman one could ever hope to meet the sister said
2584061 im not surprised at all no one cares about us lets call it what it is
2584062 the guy got introduced like he was the president added antonio pierce
2584063 he got the broadway sign hes on the paper every day that must be nice for him
2584064 i think hes going to realize the media here is a little different than green bay hes not going to control it
2584065 yeah he already got a key to the city too actually he didnt im not saying the value of that key has gone down at all it was quite a warm welcome but i think everybody knows that in new york it doesnt last long thats why its such a great city to play for

2584069 muhammad bin mutsanna bercerita kepadaku dari bakar bin yahya bin ziyan al anzi dari mandal dari amasy dari athiyah dari abu said al khudri ia berkata
2584070 rasulullah saw bersabda ayat ini turun bagi lima orang yaitu saya ali hasan husein dan fatimah
2584071 ketika turun ayat sesungguhnya allah ingin menghilangkan dosa darimu wahai ahlul bait dan menyucikanmu dengan sebersih bersihnya maka rasulullah saw memanggil ali fatimah hasan dan husein lalu beliau menutup mereka dengan pakaian ala khaibar dan beliau berkata ya allah mereka itu ahlul baitku hilangkan dosa dari mereka dan sucikanlah sebersi bersihnya ummu salamah berkata bukankah aku termasuk mereka nabi saw berkata kamu baik untukku
2584072 nabi telah keluar pada suatu pagi dengan memakai mard marhal daripada bulu hitam kemudian datang hasan bin ali lalu dimasukkan ke dalamnya setelah itu datang pula husayn dan dimasukkan ke dalamnya kemudian datang f timah dan dimasukkan dia ke dalamnya dan akhir sekali ali datang dan dimasukkan ke dalamnya lalu membaca ayat
2584073 husein berkata dan siapakah ahlul bait nabi itu wahai zaid bukankah istri istri beliau itu termasuk ahlul baitnya zaid berkata sesungguhnya istri istri nabi itu termasuk ahlul baitnya namun ahlul baitnya itu orang yang haram menerima sedekah setelah beliau wafat
2584074 nabi saw melangsungkan pernikahan dengan zainab binti jahsy dengan hidangan roti dan daging maka saya mengirim makanan lalu nabi saw keluar dan menuju kamar aisyah seraya berkata assalamualaikum ahlul bait wa rahmatullah salam sejahtera atas kamu wahai ahlul bait dan semoga allah melimpahkan rahmatnya kepadamu maka aisyah menjawab wa alaika salam wa rahmatullah dan semoga kesejahteraan dan rahmat allah atasmu lalu nabi saw mengitari kamar semua istrinya dan berkata kepada mereka seperti yang dikatakan kepada aisyah dan merekapun menjawab seperti jawaban aisyah
2584075 sesungguhnya allah bermaksud hendak menghilangkan dosa darimu hai ahlul bait dan menyucikanmu sebersih bersihnya
2584076 dan hendaklah kamu tetap di rumahmu dan janganlah kamu berhias dan bertingkah laku seperti orang orang jahiliyah yang dahulu dan dirikanlah shalat tunaikanlah zakat dan taatilah allah dan rasul nya sesungguhnya allah bermaksud hendak menghilangkan dosa dari kamu hai ahlul bait dan membersihkan kamu sebersih bersihnya
2584077 hai isteri isteri nabi siapa siapa di antaramu yang mengerjakan perbuatan keji yang nyata niscaya akan di lipat gandakan siksaan kepada mereka dua kali lipat
2584078 kehalusan allah swt kepada manusia sehingga terhindar dari hal hal yangb buruk
2584079 yang dimaksud dengan ahlul bait disini adalah ulama yang mengamalkan ilmunya karena mereka adalah orang orang yang tidak meninggalkan adapun orang yang bodoh atau orang alim yang bercampur dengan kemaksiatan mereka itu adalah orang yang asing dalam posisi ini
2584080 hadis ini memberikan pengertian tentang adanya orang dari ahlul bait yang suci yang pantas dijadikan pedoman dalam setiap masa sampai hari kiamat begitu juga oleh karena itu mereka mendatangkan kesejahteraan terhadap penduduk bumi dan jika mereka pergi maka hilanglah ketentraman penduduk bumi
2584081 menolak mengingkari imamah adalah kufur sebagaimana menolak mengingkari kenabian adalah kufur
2584082 barangsiapa yang ingin hidup seperti hidupku ingin meninggal seperti aku meninggal dan bertempat di surga yang telah dijanjikan allah swt kepadaku dan pohon pohon ditanam oleh kedua tangan nya maka dia harus menjadikan ali bin abi thalib sebagai pemimpin sebab dia tidak akan mengeluarkan kamu dari kebenaran dan tidak akan memasukkan kamu ke dalam kesesatan
2584083 barangsiapa yang senang untuk hidup seperti hidupku ingin meninggal seperti meninggalku dan berpegang teguh dengan bambu mutiara yang dititahkan allah swt dengan tangan nya kemudian dia berfirman kepadanya jadilah maka jadilah bambu mutiara itu maka dia harus menjadikan ali bin abi thalib sebagai pemimpin sesudahku
2584084 barangsiapa yang senang untuk hidup seperti hidupku ingin meninggal seperti meninggalku dan bertempat di surga di atas adn yang dititahkan tuhanku maka dia harus menjadikan ali sebagai pemimpin sesudahku dan menjadikan pemimpin orang yang dicintainya dan dia harus mengikuti para imam setelahku sebab mereka adalah keluargaku dan mereka diciptakan dari tanahku dan diberikan pemahaman dan ilmu dan celakalah umatku yang mendustakan keutamaan mereka dan memutuskan hubungan mereka denganku semoga allah tidak memberikan syafaatku kepada mereka
2584085 sesungguhnya ali bagian diriku dan aku bagian darinya dan dia adalah pemimpin setiap orang mukmin yang sesudahku
2584086 ini hadis hasan gharib dan kami tidak mengetahuinya selain dari jafar bin sulaiman
2584087 sesungguhnya pemimpin kamu hanyalah allah rasul nya dan orang orang yang beriman yang mendirikan sholat dan menunaikan zakat seraya mereka ruku kepada allah
2584088 orang orang yang beriman yang mendirikan sholat dan menunaikan zakat seraya ruku
2584089 jika tindakan ini merupakan cermin keutamaan penghulu para imam ali r a yang diikuti oleh para imam lalu mengapa tindakan ini tidak dilakukan oleh manusia terbaik nabi muhammad saw juga tidak dilakukan oleh para sahabat yang lain
2584090 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu mengambil orang orang yahudi dan nasrani menjadi pemimpin pemimpin sebahagian mereka adalah pemimpin bagi sebahagian yang lain barangsiapa diantara kamu mengambil mereka menjadi pemimpin maka sesungguhnya orang itu termasuk golongan mereka sesungguhnya allah tidak memberi petunjuk kepada orang orang yang zalim
2584091 dan barangsiapa mengambil allah rasul nya dan orang orang yang beriman menjadi penolongnya maka sesungguhnya pengikut allah itulah yang pasti menang
2584092 hai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kamu mengambil jadi pemimpinmu orang orang yang membuat agamamu jadi buah ejekan dan permainan di antara orang orang yang telah diberi kitab sebelummu dan orang orang yang kafir dan bertakwalah kepada allah jika kamu betul betul orang orang yang beriman
2584093 ayat ini turun berkenaan dengan ubadah ibnu shamit r a yang telah memutuskan hubungan dengan orang yahudi dan rela untuk taat kepada allah rasul nya dan orang yang beriman maka setelah ayat itu allah berfirman dan barangsiapa mengambil allah rasul nya dan orang orang yang beriman menjadi penolongnya maka sesungguhnya pengikut allah itulah yang pasti menang q s 56 dalam konteks ini allah berfirman allah telah memutuskan sesungguhnya aku dan rasul ku akan menang sesungguhnya allah itu maha kuat lagi maha mulia sesungguhnya golongan allah adalah orang orang yang menang maka setiap orang yang rela menjadikan allah rasul nya dan orang orang yang beriman sebagai pemimpin dialah yang menang dunia dan akhirat oleh karena itu allah berfirman dan barangsiapa mengambil allah rasul nya dan orang orang yang beriman menjadi penolongnya maka sesungguhnya pengikut allah itulah yang pasti menang q s 56
2584094 siapa yang membantahmu tentang kisah isa sesudah datang ilmu maka katakanlah
2584095 mengapa di waktu kamu mendengar berita bohon itu orang orang muminin dan muminat tidak bersangka baik terhadap diri mereka sendiri dan berkata
2584096 dan ketika kami mengambil janji dari kamu kamu tidak akan menumpahkan darahmu dan kamu tidak akan mengusir dirimu dari kampung halamanmu kemudian kamu berikrar sedang kamu mempersaksikannya
2584097 hai rasul sampaikanlah apa yang diturunkan kepadamu dari tuhanmu dan jika tidak kamu kerjakan kamu tidak menyampaikan amanat nya allah memelihara kamu dari manusia sesungguhnya allah tidak memberi petunjuk kepada orang orang yang kafir
2584098 limadza akhtartu mahzab ahlul bayt mengapa aku memilih mahzab ahlul bait
2584099 semua ahli tafsir sunnah dan syiah bersepakat bahwa ayat ini diturunkan di ghadir khum mengenai ali as bagi melaksanakan urusan imamah
2584100 aku berpendapat sebenarnya para ulama islam telah bersepakat bahwa ayat al tabligh surah al maidah 5 67 telah diturunkan kepada ali as secara khusus bagi mengukuhkan khalifah untuknya di hari tersebut riwayat hadith al ghadir adalah mutawatir ianya telah diriwayatkan oleh semua ahli sejarah dan ahli hadith dari berbagai golongan dan ianya telah diperakukan oleh ahli hadith dari golongan sunnah dan syiah
2584101 saya telah membaca mempelajari hadis dari ayahku selama 30 tahun dan beliau tidak sedikitpun menyebutkan tentang syiah kepadaku beliau juga tidak pernah menyembunyikan sesuatu kepadaku
2584102 barangsiapa yang menjadikan aku sebagai maula pemimpinnya maka jadikan ali sebagai maula pemimpinnya man kuntu maulah fahazaa aliyyun maulah
2584103 pada hari ini telah kusempurnakan untuk kamu agamamu dan telah ku cukupkan kepadamu dan telah ku ridhai islam itu jadi agama bagimu
2584104 allah maha besar atas penyempurnaannya terhadap agama pemenuhan nya terhadap nikmat kerelaan nya terhadap risalahku dan kepemimpinan ali sesudahku
2584105 riwayat riwayat tentang ghadir khum yang di dalamnya terdapat perintah kepada nabi saw untuk mengangkat ali sebagai khalifah tidak shahih dan sama sekali tidak diterima oleh ahlusunnah
2584106 pada hari ini telah kusempurnakan untuk kamu agamamu dan telah ku cukupkan kepadamu dan telah ku ridhai islam itu jadi agama bagimu
2584107 saya ragu apakah hari tsb hari jumat atau bukan dan ayat yang dimaksud tersebut adalah
2584108 pada saat perang tabuk rasulullah saw memberikan jabatan kepada ali bin abi thalib di madinah ali berkata ya rasulullah engkau mengangkat aku sebagai pejabat dalam kelompok wanita dan anak anak maka nabi saw berkata apakah kamu tidak puas jika posisimu bagiku seperti posisi harun bagi musa hanya saja tidak ada nabi sesudahku
2584109 saya mendengar ali bin abi talib bertanya kepada orang orang saya demi allah ingin mengetahui orang yang mendengar apa yang dikatakan rasulullah saw pada hari ghadir kum
2584110 bukankah allah itu lebih utama daripada diri orang orang yang beriman
2584111 ya allah siapa yang aku sebagai pemimpinnya maulah maka ali sebagai pemimpinnya maulah ya allah cintailah orang orang yang mencintainya dan musuhilah orang orang yang memusuhinya
2584112 telah menceritakan kepada kami ali bin hakim al audi dari syuraik dari abi ishaq ari said bin wahb dari zaid bin yutsi keduanya berkata ali berkata kepada orang orang di rahbah siapakah yang mendengar sesuatu yang dikatakan rasulullah saw pada hari ghadir kum diharap berdiri maka enam orang dari arah said dan enam orang lagi dari sisi zaid berdiri lalu menyatakan bahwa mereka mendengar rasulullah saw berkata untuk ali pada hari ghadir kum bukankah allah itu lebih utama daripada diri orang orang yang beriman mereka menjawab benar nabi saw berkata ya allah siapa yang aku sebagai pemimpinnya maulah maka ali sebagai pemimpinnya maulah ya allah cintailah orang yang mencintainya dan musuhilah orang yang memusuhinya
2584113 dan mereka diberi petunjuk kepada ucapan ucapan yang baik dan ditunjuki pula kepada jalan yang terpuji
2584114 anekdot dan kutipan daripada tentang wilayah fi hi nukat wa natf min al tanzil fi al wilayah
2584115 rasulullah saw ditanya ya rasulullah siapakah pemimpin setelah engkau nabi saw menjawab jika kamu menjadikan abu bakar sebagai pemimpin maka kamu dapatkan dia sebagai orang yang jujur zuhud dalam urusan dunia dan senang pada kehidupan akhirat dan jika kamu menjadikan umar sebagai pemimpin maka dia orang yang kuat jujur dan tidak takut kecaman siapapun dalam menegakkan hukum allah dan jika kamu menjadikan ali sebagai pemimpin dan saya lihat kamu tidak melakukannya maka kamu dapatkan dia orang yang memberikan petunjuk kepadamu dan orang yang terbimbing pada jalan yang lurus
2584116 umar bin khattab ditanya apakah kamu tidak mengangkat khalifah ia berkata jika aku tidak mengangkat khalifah maka tindakan ini juga dilakukan oleh orang yang lebih baik dariku yakni rasulullah saw dan jika aku menentukan khalifah maka tindakan ini juga dilakukan oleh orang yang lebih baik dariku yaitu abu bakar
2584117 cemas cemas harap saya suka jika selamat dari khalifah karena menjaga diri agar hal itu tidak untukku dan tidak atasku saya tidak akan mampu menanggungnya baik hidup maupun mati
2584118 saya masuk ke rumah hafsah lalu dia berkata apakah kamu mengetahui bahwa ayahmu tidak mengangkat khalifah saya berkata tidak mungkin dia melakukan itu hafsah berkata sungguh dia harus melakukan itu ibnu umar berkata maka saya bersumpah untuk membicarakan hal itu kepadanya umar namun saya diam sampai esok hari dan belum membicarakan hal itu kepadanya dan seakan saya memikul gunung di pundak kananku sampai saya kembali lalu saya masuk kepadanya dan dia menanyakan kepadaku tentang keadaan manusia maka aku pun memberitahunya ibnu umar berkata kemudian saya berkata saya mendengar manusia mengatakan suatu pendapat maka saya kembali untuk menanyakannya padamu mereka beranggapan bahwa engkau tidak mengangkat khalifah dan bahwa jika kamu mempunyai pengembala unta atau pengembala kambing kemudian dia datang kepadamu dan meninggalkan untau atau kambingnya itu maka kamu berpendapat bahwa dia mengabaikan tugasnya itu sedangkan memimpin manusia itu lebih berat ibnu umar berkata maka dia sepakat dengan ucapan itu lalu dia menundukkan kepalanya sejenak kemudian mengangkatnya kearahku seraya berkata sesungguhnya allah selalu menjaga agama nya jika aku tidak mengangkat khalifah maka rasulullah tidak mengangkat khalifah dan jika saya mengangkat khalifah maka abu bakar mengangkat khalifah ibnu umar berkata demi allah ketika dia menyebut nyebut rasulullah dan abu bakar maka saya mengetahui bahwa dia tidak akan mendahulukan pendapat seseorang atas rasulullah saw dan bahwa dia tidak akan mengangkat khalifah
2584119 sungguh khalifah ini akan diambil dari orang ini ali r a maka tidak ada yang menunggu karena aku kecuali orang yang sangat celaka
2584120 wahai amirul mukminin beritahukanlah kepada kami tentang ahlul bait nabi
2584121 tidak tetapi aku serahkan kepada kalian sesuatu yang rasulullah saw telah menyerahkan kepada kalian
2584122 lalu apa yang engkau katakan kepada tuhanmu jika kamu menghadap kepada nya
2584123 saya katakan ya allah engkau tinggalkan saya dalam kelompok mereka sesuatu yang jelas bagi mu kemudian engkau mencabut nyawaku dan engkau dalam kelompok mereka jika engkau menghendaki maka engkaulah yang memperbaiki mereka dan jika engkau menghendaki maka engkaulah yang membinasakan mereka
2584124 sungguh saya berhasrat atau ingin mengirimkan surat kepada abu bakar dan putranya lalu saya mengangkatnya sebagai khalifah sebab aku khawatir jika ada seseorang yang mengatakan atau orang yang mempunyai harapan
2584125 allah dan orang orang mukmin tidak mau memilih selain abu bakar
2584126 rasulullah saw berkata kepadaku panggilah abu bakar dan saudaramu untuk datang kepadaku agar aku tuliskan sesuatu kepadanya sebab sesungguhnya saya khawatir jika ada orang yang berharap dan terdapat seseorang yang mengatakan aku lebih berhak dan allah dan orang orang yang beriman tidak menghendaki kecuali abu bakar
2584127 ali bin abu thalib adalah yang paling unggul dari para sahabat tetapi khilafah dipercayakan kepada abu bakar disatu sisi karena alasan kebijaksanaan dan di sisi lain dari pertimbangan agama misalnya ada keperluan meredam api perang sipil dan menentramkan hati umat dimana pengalaman ali dalam berperang yang berlangsung pada masa nabi masih kuat membekas dan pedang ali masih basah dengan darah orang orang quraisy dan orang orang musyrik lainnya lagi pula ada dendam yang belum hilang dalam hati orang orang tertentu dan berhasrat ingin membalas dendam hati orang orang tidak sepenuhnya diserahkan kepada ali dan mereka tidak siap untuk memberikan penyerahan diri sepenuh hati
2584128 sesungguhnya kami mengerti keutamaanmu dan apa yang disebutkan allah kepadamu dan kami tidak akan mengungguli kamu dalam kebaikan yang allah limpahkan kepadamu tetapi kamu tidak bermusyawarah dengan kami dalam hal ini sedangkan kami melihat adanya bagian kami karena kekerabatan kami dengan rasulullah
2584129 demi yang jiwaku berada dalam genggaman nya sungguh kerabat rasulullah itu lebih aku cintai daripada kerabatku adapun yang terjadi antara saya dengan kalian dalam keadaan itu ialah saya tidak berpaling dari kebaikan dan saya tidak akan meninggalkan sesuatu yang saya lihat rasulullah saw melakukannya
2584130 apa yang saya lakukan bukan untuk menyaingi abu bakar melainkan kami melihat bahwa kami mempunyai bagian dalam hal ini sedangkan abu bakar tidak bermusyawarah dengan kami
2584131 ali tidak membaiat abu bakar hingga fatimah meninggal bahkan tidak seorangpun dari bani hasyim yang membaiatnya
2584132 saya mendengar rasulullah saw berkata akan ada dua belas pemimpin amri
2584133 in 2006 two years ago i made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else in 2006 i told elizabeth and asked for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness we have kept this within our family since that time
2584134 im in love with one woman ive been in love with one woman for 31 years she is the finest human being i know the fact that she is with me after this happened is a testament to the kind of woman she is
2584135 i grew up as a small town boy in north carolina came from nothing worked very hard dreamed that i could do something helpful for other people with my life became a lawyer through a lot of work and success i got some acclaim as a lawyer
2584136 then i went from being a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president becoming a national public figure all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences and nothing could be further from the truth
2584137 i was at the beverly hilton i was trying to keep this mistake i made from becoming public
2584138 ive never paid a dime of money never asked anybody to pay a dime of money nothing has been done at my request
2584139 im not sure i had a political career in the future not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2584140 mrs toguchi prayers are nice and its probably very helpful but you still need chemotherapy
2584141 dear lord youre the one who created my body so i know you can fix it
2584142 i put my whole faith in you father damien please pray for me too because i need your help
2584143 it may have delayed her eventual demise probably slow the cancer down but eventually she would have succumbed to this vicious cancer
2584144 the point here is that the primary tumor was treated
2584145 the bottom line is it probably does happen obviously it happens very rarely because it is the nature of cancer to grow not to regress
2584146 for the true believer or faithful this is a miracle for the true skeptic this is a random or very unusual coincidence for the doctor and scientist we call it complete spontaneous regression of cancer
2584147 im not the praying type but i just wanted to say thank you
2584148 mrs toguchi prayers are nice and its probably very helpful but you still need chemotherapy
2584149 dear lord youre the one who created my body so i know you can fix it
2584150 i put my whole faith in you father damien please pray for me too because i need your help
2584151 it may have delayed her eventual demise probably slow the cancer down but eventually she would have succumbed to this vicious cancer
2584152 the point here is that the primary tumor was treated
2584153 the bottom line is it probably does happen obviously it happens very rarely because it is the nature of cancer to grow not to regress
2584154 for the true believer or faithful this is a miracle for the true skeptic this is a random or very unusual coincidence for the doctor and scientist we call it complete spontaneous regression of cancer

2584156 i used it to left handers a lot i got a strikeout on it a number of outs on it i got some first pitch strikes on my curveball i thought that was key its probably not in the scouting report for them over there
2584157 im very confident i know my numbers arent great for the overall season but right now i feel like i can beat anybody i feel like im at the top of my game
2584158 i didnt know who to go hug catcher kelly shoppach or benny
2584159 having an extra pitch like a curveball just opens up a whole new area for me
2584160 my curveball was presentable at best before now i got strikeouts on it guys laid off it guys beat it into the ground it was more than just a show me pitch i think it allowed me to go a little later in the game its better to be a four pitch pitcher than a three and its really helped me against lefties
2584161 these last three or four days have been a little tough
2584162 ive talked to a lot of my teammates and obviously all the coaches its tough because you never want to be in a position where you feel like youre not being the kind of player you want to be
2584163 thats what he needs to do is be a run producer and thats what he did today in a tight ball game
2584164 we didnt play too well behind him today and cost him a lot of pitches

2584183 we take the side of science in spite of the patent absurdity of some of its constructs in spite of its failure to fulfill many of its extravagant promises of health and life in spite of the tolerance of the scientific community for unsubstantiated just so stories because we have a prior commitment a commitment to materialism it is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world but on the contrary that we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations no matter how counter intuitive no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated moreover that materialism is an absolute for we cannot allow a divine foot in the door
2584184 i think we really are giving him too much attention it is our constant reaction that helps some christians think that ray is really getting to us or that he has something if we ignored him hed be less successful

2584263 what i do know is that this is another of those cases where there is a tacit but uniform agreement among pretty much all reporters and close campaign watchers not to publicly state the obvious that this is a perilous development for john mccain just as bill clintons public undressing in the lewinsky scandal led indirectly to the exposure of several high profile republican affairs edwards revelation will inevitably put pressure on the press in general to scrutinize john mccain under something more searching than the jfk rules theyve applied to date i assure you that this dimension of the story occurred to every reporter even tangentially involved in reporting this race soon after the edwards story hit yesterday afternoon

2584278 babylon the great is fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies

2584285 the decision is devastating to the kondh but it will not halt the communitys fight to save niyamgiri
2584286 we will not leave niyamgiri without our mountain our god there is no life for us
2584287 niyamgiri bauxite would come at the cost of clean water and pristine forest in an otherwise drought hit district
2584288 permitting mining would pave the way for persecution of a minority community and deny legal protection for their religious beliefs
2584289 depending on the outcome of the lawsuits things could drag out for a while
2584290 but i would hope the outcome would be favorable and we could move ahead
2584291 it preserves a considerable amount of open space and we already had a lot of open space being preserved
2584292 the conservation easement will ensure that the sites protected by the approved project and deemed sacred by the united auburn indian community will be retained forever in their scenic natural valley setting
2584293 in addition our tribe will also construct a cultural center where people of all ages will be able to gain a greater understanding of the rich cultural history of the area
2584294 but until things are signed and stamped ill make sure we keep on top of this
2584295 to me the clover valley foundation lawsuit could potentially save the entire valley so i think its important for that to continue on also

2584308 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2584309 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2584310 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2584311 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2584312 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2584313 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2584314 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2584315 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2584386 his success now defined her success so she was willing to go along with the fraud that that their marriage was fine
2584387 when we seek death we often seek to achieve a symbolic immortality and becoming a presidential wife could have been that for her

2584470 if labour are to have any hope of wooing the electorate then a change at the top may restore their fortunes but it is no magic bullet
2584471 and if labour chose a new leader he or she would have to work very hard to gain the publics confidence it would not come automatically
2584472 there may be no point in waving the hybrid flag at this point
2584473 i feel their pain but this case is over he was already acquitted in a foreign jurisdiction
2584474 the entire political spectrum wants a solution which does not disturb the peace and stability of the country
2584475 we met 15 delegations talks will continue as only through a process of dialogue a solution acceptable to all parties can be agreed upon
2584476 we have presented our agenda to the delegation and our main demand that the land should be restored remains our agitation will continue
2584477 they just listened to our demand and no fresh proposals were made
2584478 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2584479 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2584480 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2584481 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2584482 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2584483 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2584484 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2584485 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2584486 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds

2584491 from their point of view they needed someone to hang in there and continue batting and thats exactly what he did
2584492 the concentration he showed in batting for long periods of time is what makes him world class
2584493 the batsmen will have to concentrate hard for their runs and the bowlers will have to bowl the right line and length and bend their back
2584494 just run in give your best be patient and wait for batsmen to make mistakes
2584495 the review system might be a little bit of a comeback for the bowlers there will be more outs than not outs all the bowlers should be pretty happy that the review system is in place

2584497 it is too late for monika to come to beijing now and take part in the olympic games because we have closed the entry process
2584498 monika just cannot take part in the olympics as of now the organisers have not accepted her entry and to be honest i dont see her competing here
2584499 could it fail should it yes please it would make my life so my easier if i could ignore this inferior piece of crap you might ask what should microsoft do instead glad you asked they should release a new version of xp which is
2584500 its really sad after the celebration of the opening ceremonies which were the best opening ceremonies ive ever been at
2584501 to the best of my knowledge this is a random action and not targeted at americans its just that you dont expect something to happen in a country like this
2584502 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2584503 the chinese government will try not to let this event have a serious impact on u s china relations
2584504 buying this r26 million ferry fits into our business plans to get people to use bloemfontein and cape town as business destinations
2584505 we are not boat people but we do know about business
2584506 the board members of our company wanted to link bloemfontein and cape town bloemfontein as a convention destination and then cape town for some leisure activity one ferry is simply not enough for the demand and often businesses cant make bookings to go to the island
2584507 its almost like the spur with people sitting around a table rather than on chairs like inside an aeroplane which is the case on the current ferry
2584508 it made sense for the island to buy its own ferry and take control of that revenue stream the operation is very profitable if it is properly managed because there is no competition
2584509 that arrangement is much more flexible and allows for maintenance and adequate capacity
2584510 i cant see how the vip ferry can make any money
2584511 a new 15m to 18m powerboat will cost between r15 million and r20 million even secondhand it would be about r8 million
2584512 to make it worthwhile you would have to net at least r2 million a year which is impossible they should just make an arrangement to have a suitable vessel and skipper on standby
2584513 that im out of a job that im regarded as a criminal and that the mail amp guardian published really devastating information about me
2584514 ive not been told by the board that im under investigation i will seek legal advice to find out what to do now
2584515 further actions could be taken but at this stage its only against those three people
2584516 the board regards these issues revealed in the forensic report very seriously because they have a direct impact on the profile of this world heritage site and the thousands of visitors who come to the island we have to ensure that the history and legacy of the island is properly respected this is very serious indeed
2584517 we have requested a meeting with new managers luckily weve only had dealings with the supply chain manager
2584518 we are in no way short of work outside of south africa
2584519 complaints are mounting in the construction sector that the chinese are not meeting legal requirements with regard to minimum wages employment equity social security pension and general work conditions
2584520 however the chinese continue to win most of the tenders for large state projects including most recently contracts to work on the new state house as well as roads
2584521 they realise that they may be sacrificing current local economic development but theyre looking at longer term political as well as economic relations
2584522 we also found that only 17 of all namibian companies were actually abiding by employment equity regulations to some extent the chinese are being singled out for criticism
2584523 there may be nations and contractors whose moral standards differ from the norm
2584524 it may be a competitive issue for a time but we believe that global norms will eventually be applied
2584525 the biggest criticism of china is that no local beneficiation takes place
2584526 but of course it does because at the simplest level the infrastructure is built
2584527 lots of south african firms have seen the threat posed by china and have been very pragmatic and taken on partnerships with chinese firms
2584528 it is a threat but it needs to be put into perspective
2584529 chinas total foreign trade with africa as a whole is still only 3 so while we are strategic we are a very small player
2584530 in the vast majority of the continent these rules dont exist
2584531 we knew we would have to bat well in the second innings
2584532 i think its even stevens now theres still a lot of hard work to do
2584533 the guys will be fighting to win because i still think we have the opportunity to win this test
2584534 all the things wed done so well in the last 18 months we forgot
2584535 hes got big boots to fill but hes certainly started the right way
2584536 hes so calm and hes got such a good head and hes pretty streetwise for his age
2584537 theres still a lot of cricket to play but we are in a good position
2584538 we are still ahead and they are two wickets down it will be important to come back early tomorrow and put them under pressure
2584539 the win helps to build our confidence which is a great thing and we will enjoy the win there are no buts about it
2584540 but we know what a step up next week against the all blacks will be and we have the ability to make that step
2584541 we know the first half was not good but it is always good to see a team go out again do it right and use their opportunities
2584542 argentina were very physical at the breakdown points but we were happy with the way we went in the lineouts and scrums
2584543 argentina uses a lot of lineout drives but with the sacking rule coming in with the elvs it made it very difficult for them
2584544 hay carros de combate georgianos en tsjinvali hay combates encarnizados por toda la ciudad

2584550 pedimos a todas las partes que respeten el derecho internacional humanitario y no ataquen a civiles y garanticen que las instalaciones m dicas y el transporte m dico puede tratar a los heridos si fuera necesario
2584551 se trata de una situaci n en la que las ambulancias no pueden moverse los hospitales est n al parecer desbordados y las intervenciones quir rgicas se est n realizando en los pasillos

2584556 no es una acci n militar es una operaci n anti criminal para proteger a nuestros civiles pac ficos tanto georgianos como osetios
2584557 la situaci n es el resultado de una pol tica de apaciguamiento de determinados estados que abastecen a georgia con armas entre ellos tambi n los estados unidos
2584558 estamos muy preocupados sobre los informes que relatan que un gran n mero de tropas y tanques rusos est n pasando el t nel de roki en violaci n de la soberan a e integridad de georgia
2584559 lo que est en marcha en bolivia con el apoyo el amparo y la participaci n de los estados unidos es la violencia contrarrevolucionaria la misma que se levant contra cuba y contra allende aquella que estableci las dictaduras del cono sur aplic planes como el c ndor e hizo la guerra sucia en nicaragua y en centroam rica los oligarcas bolivianos est n sobre las armas y evo morales y sus defensores gente de paz y de bien est n terriblemente solos no pasar n debiera ser la consigna de am rica

2584564 las prisas y los beneficios se han antepuesto a esa id lica idea es decir la falta de personal y las jornadas de trabajo de hasta 15 horas han constituido una carga de trabajo que nos obliga a pensar en la primera de las causa de este accidente
2584565 si a esta situaci n le unimos la insensibilidad de la empresa a las quejas constatadas de los trabajadores sobre la pasarela en la que se produjo el siniestro el panorama se aclara y las responsabilidades empiezan aflorar

2584569 we wanted to share our academic work with the security community and had planned to withhold a key detail of our results so that a malicious attacker could not use our research for fraudulent purposes
2584570 were disappointed that the court is preventing us from presenting our findings even with this safeguard
2584571 the courts order is an illegal prior restraint on legitimate academic research in violation of the first amendment
2584572 the court has adopted an interpretation of the statute that is blatantly unconstitutional equating discussion in a public forum with computer intrusion security and the public interest benefit immensely from the free flow of ideas and information on vulnerabilities more importantly squelching research and scientific discussion wont stop the attackers it will just stop the public from knowing that these systems are vulnerable and from pressuring the companies that develop and implement them to fix security holes

2584579 we pour almost endless resources roughly 50 billion every year into catching trying and incarcerating people who primarily harm themselves
2584580 this insane war on drugs damages communities and drains crucial resources from the police courts and prisons these resources could be better used to combat serious street and corporate crime
2584581 nader gonzales would empty prisons of nonviolent drug offenders and fill them up with convicted corporate criminals
2584582 as with alcoholics and nicotine addicts the approach to drug addicts should be rehabilitation not incarceration
2584583 we dont put nicotine addicts in jail we dont put alcoholics in jail they lead to far greater mortality and morbidity than drug addicts
2584584 somewhere along the line somebodys going to be paying for it

2584597 when a woman sees and feels especially comfortable with a man she will tilt her head
2584598 you might notice she will shift her body in the same direction as yours or take your lead for behavior changes like picking up a glass to drink or blinking her eyes repeatedly if youre doing so
2584599 when a woman is attracted to a man her pupils will dilate
2584600 essentially the body does this in order to allow itself to take in more of a good thing
2584601 when a woman on a date places her hands in front of her body especially if they are crossed she is closing herself off from the man
2584602 men are not nearly as perceptive as women so even if shes not consciously aware of it a woman knows her body language needs to be very loud
2584603 in this instance that body language reads loud and clear
2584604 when i ask male friends how a blind date went step by step and they say she put her bag on the table i always know thats a bad sign
2584605 romantic conversation does not occur at the same speed as business conversation
2584606 conversation between two people who are attracted typically slows to about three quarter speed and softens in fact most emotional conversation with the exception of very hostile conversation is at a slowed cadence
2584607 her body language may be the key to the real truth
2584608 if a woman is gently stroking her neck when telling you this it may be a sign that shes interested but it is also known to be a sign of lying

2584667 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2584668 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2584669 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2584670 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2584671 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2584672 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2584673 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2584674 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2584675 we asked them already we told them in advance however they told us to wait until they received their orders from their higher ups in about two weeks

2584681 reflects the courts view that they believe that the massachusetts bay transit authority was likely to succeed on the merits we think thats actually not the case
2584682 courts have found that the first amendment covers these things

2584685 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2584686 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2584687 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2584688 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2584689 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2584690 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2584691 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2584692 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2584693 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds
2584694 el aprendizaje de una segunda lengua simult neamente con la primera produce una doble competencia muy dif cil de conseguir en otras pocas de la vida
2584695 todos los estudios sobre ni os que aprenden a hablar en dos lenguas apuntan a que el aprendizaje se hace de la misma manera y en las mismas etapas que los ni os monoling es
2584696 la nica diferencia es que en un ni o biling e cualquier avance en una de las lenguas puede estar influido por un avance previo en la otra lengua
2584697 alexander con tres a os est en una etapa en la que suele mezclar en una conversaci n varias lenguas sin embargo noah de cinco y medio ya es capaz de desenvolverse en las tres lenguas independientemente identificando perfectamente cu ndo y con qui n debe utilizar cada una de ellas
2584698 aunque me recomendaron utilizar el m todo de un padre una lengua ahora mismo con la experiencia que tengo pienso que hubiera sido mejor utilizar el m todo de una lengua en el contexto familiar y otra en el social
2584699 los investigadores se han concentrado normalmente en estudiar la adquisici n del lenguaje en ni os biling es pero no en c mo se desarrolla el biling ismo posteriormente cuando son peque os y son hijos nicos es f cil que haya m s equilibrio entre las dos lenguas pero a medida que se hacen mayores la exposici n que tienen al segundo idioma es m nima si se reduce nicamente a la comunicaci n con un miembro de la familia mientras que la otra lengua adem s de utilizarla en casa con el otro progenitor y con los hermanos se impone en el contexto externo esto produce en muchos casos falta de inter s por la otra lengua
2584700 creando contextos monoling es o biling es que favorecen o dificultan el uso productivo de la segunda lengua
2584701 ante esto lo recomendable es utilizar la estrategia del entendimiento m nimo simular que no se ha comprendido lo que ha dicho el ni o para provocar un cambio de registro
2584702 aquellos que la utilizan confirman que con ella se refuerza el h bito de dirigirse al progenitor siempre en su lengua fomentando el uso activo y natural de ese idioma
2584703 im not afraid of the people its better to submit to the people than to certain domestic and foreign interests
2584704 we hope they find an agreement either before the referendum or immediately afterwards on just one interpretation of the rules
2584705 this referendum is illegal there is no room for a referendum in the constitution if the president looses he can call for an election but if one of the governors looses he will have to leave right away
2584706 the situation in bolivia is that what i do is legal and what my enemy does is illegal so right now nobody respects the laws
2584707 security as to how their votes will be counted and how the results will be defined
2584708 most people think the referendum is a distraction from the problems we have and i dont think itll change anything really

2584713 things never turn out exactly the way you planned i know they didnt with me still like my father used to say traffics traffic you go where life takes you and growing up happens in a heartbeat one day youre in diapers the next youre gone but the memories of childhood stay with you for the long haul i remember a time a place a particular fourth of july the things that happened in that decade of war and change i remember a house like a lot of houses a yard like a lot of yards on a street like a lot of other streets i remember how hard it was growing up among people and places i loved most of all i remember how hard it was to leave and the thing is after all these years i still look back in wonder
2584714 all of our young lives we search for someone to love someone that makes us complete we choose partners and change partners we dance to a song of heartbreak and hope all the while wondering if somewhere somehow theres someone perfect who might be searching for us
2584715 when youre a little kid youre a bit of everything scientist philosopher artist sometimes it seems like growing up is giving these things up one at a time
2584716 i never knew until that moment how bad it could hurt to lose something you never really had
2584717 no it was actually slowed down i didnt think that the speed was that different a lot of guys made my transition easier by telling me what to look forward to it definitely was a piece of cake for me
2584718 its just different its not just got to get used to it it will probably become second nature to me once i use it a little more defensive players have never had this but the quarterbacks have had it for awhile they probably felt the same way about it when it first came in its something weve just got to get used to we are just going to keep working with it in practice while were here in albany and in the next few preseason games

2584744 i went around saying it doesnt bother me but it really did but flagstaff was a turning point
2584745 i had just read something before going out for my run and i started crying so much while i was running that i had to stop and sit down
2584746 after that i calmed down and i just thought to myself im not doing this any more theyre not that important to get in the way of something i enjoy doing i just felt that they could say what they want the important thing was that i knew that i was not a quitter
2584747 you think about it as any other race and in any race that i go into the aim is to go in and win the race
2584748 in terms of judging my shape its impossible to do this year
2584749 normally in my preparations i can do tempo runs over certain courses and compare them to say how i was in london in 2005 or chicago i cant do that this year because everything has been dictated by what my leg can take
2584750 my country did not send me 5 000 miles to start a race they sent me 5 000 miles to finish it

2584774 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
2584775 christians dont share tolerance as a core value increasingly we are falling into a situation where we are adopting this doctrine of tolerance which is falling well short of where christ wants us
2584776 anglicanism is going to survive but differently the gafcon group because of demographics and growth is going to become anglicanism
2584777 theres good in that but problems as well it would be better if the moderates would align with the orthodox conservative wing of the church but anglicanism is by definition a broad church
2584778 i dont think a formal split is occurring i do think the global south is going to continue on its way and the rest of the church will have to show it is ready to align with it
2584779 abandoning the communion of this church does not mean we abandon a person as a member of the body of christ
2584780 as a matter of fact i havent heard anything from her or any of her friends nonetheless i have not had any kind of disparaging conversation about her with anybody i have not even spoken ill against the two bishops who brought charges against me i have just let it go because i know where my faith is and i have stated that

2584786 the federal senate is evaluating projected bill 122 2006 intended to protect those who choose to adopt homosexual attitudes and practices if approved the bill would hinder the catholic church which strives to follow the gospel thus a priest who condemns homosexuality in his homily may be judged for causing moral ethical philosophical or psychological embarrassment a decision by a seminary rector to refuse admittance to a homosexual student could bring him three to four years in jail
2584787 in the lula government the pro abortion cause that attacks human life walks hand in hand with the pro homosexual cause that attacks the virtue of chastity on which the family is built since the beginning of 2003 the government has been actively pursuing an agenda both domestically and with the international community un and oas to glorify homosexuality and treat those who oppose homosexual conduct as homophobic criminals
2584788 what does it mean it means that in addition to the basic rights guaranteed by the federal constitution to all people those who practice homosexuality will also have rights by virtue of the homosexuality they practice the bill grants rights to homosexuals not in their capacity as persons but in their capacity as homosexuals now then homosexuality understood as the practice of carnal intercourse between persons of the same sex is a vice against nature that cannot grant any rights whatsoever to anyone
2584789 homosexuality would cease being a vice and become a source of merit likewise anyone daring to criticize homosexual conduct would be criminalized
2584790 the proposed legislation intends to punish with 2 to 5 years inprisonment anyone who dares prohibit or prevent the public practice of an obscene act manifestation of affection by homosexuals art n 7
2584791 a priest who condemns homosexuality in his sermon could be prosecuted as per article n
2584792 the rector of a seminary who rejects a homosexual student could be condemned with 3 to 5 years in jail art n 5
2584793 the gay gag law gay super rights unconstitutionality and totalitarianism
2584794 the projected bill is flagrantly unconstitutional and beckons the implantation of totalitarianism and state ideological terrorism in blatant violation of the rights of equality free expression of ones thought inviolability of freedom of conscience and belief non discrimination for reasons of religious philosophical or political beliefs and a violation of due process material or substantive art 5 caput iv vi viii liv of the brazilian constitution
2584795 what is really behind the projected bill is an attempt to impose as dogma the morality and naturalness of homosexuality this dogma is not scientific but has a marxist ideological origin denying this supposed truth would become punishable by penal law nothing could be more aggressive or inadmissible it is policing ideology obviously law could never oblige anyone to accept papal infallibility and yet this law would impose the dogma of the infallibility of the marxist thinkers erich fromm and herbert marcuse on all brazilians

2584824 much as we might detest their move we need to allow the group of 300 odd muslim protestors have their say

2584831 a much higher fraction of passengers from the cheapest decks were lost well see the same phenomenon with global warming
2584832 and i think it pretty much will remain on its own
2584833 knowledge related to the societal dimensions of global environmental problems is fundamental to efforts to arrive at practical and effective solutions
2584834 if anything we need to expand attention in these areas
2584835 the global burden of climate change attributable diarrhea and malnutrition are already the largest in the world in southeastern asian countries including bangladesh bhutan india maldives myanmar and nepal
2584836 illness and death are expected to increase from diarrheal diseases due to drought and flooding and are also expected from increased amounts of cholera bacteria in coastal waters
2584837 rather than slowing down the problem is accelerating there is a crisis of inaction in addressing and preparing for climate change

2584847 its good for the world to have girls playing softball
2584848 and these women are going to show young girls how to win
2584849 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
2584850 theres a catharsis everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good
2584851 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country and i think that people who supported a whole range of different candidates during the primaries are going to come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that we have to take the white house back
2584852 i spoke to senator clinton this week shes campaigning for me in nevada and florida she is very enthusiastic about the need for a unified party i think we are going to have a terrific convention as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics of the four days our staffs are in communication my staff with senator clintons staff but i dont anticipate any problems
2584853 if the party is speaking about unity they the clinton delegates believe the only way to unify the party is actually allowing them to vote
2584854 moving beyond the convention if they were not allowed to vote there would be a lot of resentment
2584855 i dont know if all of this will work i have to say that i have to give you straight talk i do
2584856 i cant assure you that this train wreck isnt going to happen but i will do everything in my power to see that we avert it
2584857 my straight talk would be please dont let this foreign company ruin our part of the world
2584858 im personally calling on john mccain to send rick davis to germany to use his considerable clout with dhl to help save these 8 200 jobs in southwest ohio
2584859 come here to wilmington and come here to ohio and explain the reasons and rationale for their decision
2584860 thats why john mccain will go hide at his ranch for a few days and be done with it poor obama he doesnt have a ranch
2584861 getting him in a swimming suit will be one of the big gets
2584862 one of the great mistakes campaigns make is that we just burn out the candidates
2584863 particularly after he won the nomination kerry needed to take some time that is when he made a couple of mistakes in public events that he would not have made if he had taken off a few weeks
2584864 what the church is for rather than what it is against
2584865 drive the issue of abortion like a wedge into the soul of the nation
2584866 ronald reagan promised that and he gave us some of the worst judges we have today
2584867 i think a lot of christians are already being courted by him and are being taken in by his charisma and his communication
2584868 when he says he wants to make abortion rare but has a 100 percent voting record on abortion from naral pro choice america for his u s senate votes its the talk of a politician
2584869 should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket
2584870 taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster
2584871 and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
2584872 as you may know the democratic national convention is just a couple of weeks away
2584873 it was four years ago at the same gathering that america heard a fine speech from an illinois state senator named barack obama hes done pretty well for himself since then and the smart money in denver is on another celebrated performance
2584874 but even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content
2584875 in the meantime let me take a stab at a plot summary of the obama campaign america is finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit government is too big and he wants to grow it taxes are too high and he wants to raise them congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it
2584876 in recent days weve seen two stark examples of exactly whats wrong with washington and whats at stake in this election
2584877 i believe that we need to move in a new direction this is a defining moment in our history we can either continue down a failed course or we can choose a better future
2584878 should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket
2584879 taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster
2584880 and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
2584881 as for me and my house we will serve the lord
2584882 4 the highest possible and they dont give them out easy on his taks last year
2584883 during the civil rights movement black children would get picked on at school and when they got home they were told black is beautiful and youre fine just the way you are
2584884 eliminating vending machines serving salads for lunch and increasing their gym time have increased their fear
2584885 unfortunately weight prejudice continues to be culturally condoned in our society
2584886 weight prejudice must be made unacceptable and positive body image should be encouraged and diversity valued
2584887 body image disparagement chronic dieting and exercise to improve appearance need to be acknowledged as vehicles of oppression
2584888 to a generation that had grown up hearing falsely how americas culinary abundance was dangerous because it causes obesity and so heart disease it was easy to make the logical leap that food caused health or disease and that american habits were unhealthy
2584889 the official campaign against overweight became much more potent and pervasive in the seventies because it was embedded in a larger philosophical and social change the development of the health ethic
2584890 fat people eat junk and are too stupid to understand nutrition
2584891 fat people cant help but have unhealthy diets and lifestyles in todays environment
2584892 help them feel better about themselves and spare them from further weight discrimination and stigma
2584893 yeah we should just ship all the fatties to a concentration camp
2584894 overweight people receive a constant barrage of criticism and abuse and have never been more persecuted
2584895 the world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page
2584896 non litighiamo pi anche se sapete che unora pi tardi starete discutendo per qualcosa
2584897 without question the most important movie you are likely to see this year
2584898 the increased acceptance of greener vehicles such as hybrid and electric vehicles is to be encouraged they have an important role in improving fuel economy and reducing emissions our advanced external sound synthesis technology increases pedestrian safety while retaining the cars environmental benefits we hope that legislators introduce minimum noise requirements for vehicles to encourage the adoption of technologies such as ours which will ultimately increase pedestrian safety
2584899 blind and partially sighted people use the noise of oncoming traffic as a cue for when it is safe to cross a road if a quiet hybrid electric vehicle is approaching then they will no longer have this cue and are immediately put at risk
2584900 as the leading voice on transport and mobility issues in the visual impairment sector guide dogs believes further research and development is needed to address the issues of identifying quiet vehicles for blind and partially sighted people the charity recognises the environmental benefits of these vehicles however more consideration needs to be given to the safety implications to visually impaired pedestrians
2584901 road safety professionals teach children that they can improve their safety by listening for traffic and the sound of an approaching vehicle is a warning that most pedestrians will use before making the decision to cross the road new electric engines make vehicles much quieter so we need to look at ways of ensuring the safety of pedestrians we welcome innovative solutions which address this
2584902 ive read mr obamas statement that he believes his daughters should not receive preferential treatment over a poor white child
2584903 i agree with him in fact i agree with a lot of the things he says about affirmative action except his conclusion on the initiatives
2584904 if you listen to all the things he says we agree on everything leading up to its conclusion he says all the right things
2584905 im a strong supporter of affirmative action if properly structured
2584906 if 50 percent of latino or african american kids are dropping out affirmative action doesnt matter those kids wont get to college
2584907 the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds

2584915 hey chef you got a trainee over there or what
2584916 tell him first lesson when tickets come up through the printer thingy he needs to start cooking them
2584917 if id been cooking it it would have been done 15 minutes ago
2584918 if i wanted to flip burgers for a living i would have dropped out of hs 15 years ago gone to work at mcdonalds and id still be making more money than you

2584920 mccain is the classic opportunist hes always reaching for attention and glory
2584921 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2584922 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
2584923 iraq and the united states near an agreement on troop withdrawal

2584999 one of the most adjective candidates to arise in recent memory
2585000 barack obama is certainly mild superlative qualified to serve as president
2585001 regardless of what hillary and i said when she was running against him in the primaries after all hes more than 35 years old and its pretty likely that hes a u s citizen by birth constitutionally thats all you need
2585002 personally looking forward to president obamas administration for a term not to exceed four years after all 48 months is long enough to make your little statement about racial equality then we can get hillary in there while she still has enough estrogen to be considered the first woman president
2585003 knows how to say the things we want to hear in a way that makes us forget our selfish needs and focus on his
2585004 while my wife may have deep knowledge about policy and extensive experience working with leaders at the national and global level barack obama is even more impressive because hes found a way to secure his partys nomination while avoiding the drudgery of actual work and the toil of learning aint that the american dream

2585031 my experience of him during that time is that he was a very loving giving man and this doesnt make sense at all
2585032 theres just no way he could do it they just grabbed a convenient person
2585033 but if we have determined that we are absolutely unable to afford to go then we need to let the chinese festival organizers know because we absolutely dont want to cancel on them in the last minute

2585350 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience

2585354 we came here fully prepared and thats what our goal is to go on to competition on day 1 and prove to the world that we are still on top
2585355 of course it would be a dream come true to leave the olympics with a medal around my neck but i cant control that
2585356 china and the u s are the class of the world
2585357 its just something that can be very positive and sometimes can go in the other direction
2585358 they will feel stress if the journalists keep throwing questions like which medal do you think you can get
2585359 we were really fighting for it and thats the kind of mentality we had to have coming into here there has been a little bit of change on the team but when you look at the six of us you can definitely think that we are a great team and were not just individuals were one team and were competing for that gold medal
2585360 in sydney everyone believed russia would win in athens everyone believed the americans would win
2585361 but competition is competition well see in the end who wins

2585369 weve probably had over 60 000 students participate in band camp program during that time
2585370 they buy gator aid cool aide and a little bit of food so it helps out
2585371 they spend money in the vending machines they spend money at the book store they spend money at subway in addition to the fees they pay to use the facilities here

2585388 there has been a lot of comment today regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2585389 this is not about questioning the managers judgement or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
2585390 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool think the price quoted is too high
2585391 we have not been able to bring in barry but it is not a question of money i dont know what it is
2585392 a lot of fans like us even though were really small being kids and everything
2585393 a lot of fans like us even though were really small being kids and everything
2585394 with a young guy like that with his talent its a pleasure to see him go out and play hard every day hes very tough he wont shy away from any kind of contact and he hustles all the time just watching him makes everybody else raise their game
2585395 we know what he can do from last year and we just want him to come out and continue where he left off
2585396 hes a playmaker and thats what you want on defense youre going to have your solid guys but you need guys who can step up and make plays
2585397 the thing with david is that he anticipates a lot
2585398 i learned a long time ago that if you can anticipate where things are going youre a step ahead he understands his read responsibilities and before the play is run hes almost there already
2585399 it probably means more playing time for me especially if anything else happens
2585400 it puts more pressure on me because mentally i have to really push myself to get this stuff down before the preseason is over with
2585401 i have to get all the communication we need down pat as far as making line and secondary adjustments im in charge of all that

2585403 my goal is to win an sec championship above and beyond anything else
2585404 if we do that winning a national championship and everything will take care of itself i think the hardest thing to do in college football is to win an sec championship
2585405 were just focused on the sec that is my goal as a quarterback to lead the team to the sec title
2585406 in my mind we still have a ways to go on that stuff right now
2585407 thats one of the big focuses during two a days it was in the spring a little bit its not something that is a two week deal or a couple practice or couple month deal
2585408 that overall development is something that hes going to be working on hopefully for him the next 10 to 15 years developing that when the ball is snapped on game day hes going to be tim tebow you just hope he has a couple more tools in his toolbox now to use
2585409 at the end of the day the objective is to get a win
2585410 thats very clearly no 1 bolded and underlined no 2 is to be smart in how you win it and utilize the personnel that you have should we have a limited number of tebow carries yes
2585411 if i won it thatd be unbelievable thatd be awesome again
2585412 but if i didnt its not the end of the world my goals are not to win the heisman that would be great just like last year but im just focused on the sec
2585413 without this health thing without this vision and dental i couldnt go to an eye doctor i couldnt go to a dentist i dont have a dime extra in my income i cant afford to go have a cleaning let alone a filling or a crown or an extraction theres no money in my budget for this

2585419 certain pass plays i knew i was in trouble because i knew i wasnt capable of throwing a 20 yard out if coach jon gruden called that play last year i wasnt able to manage it i was thinking of ways i was going to survive the game and at least move the team down the field somehow some way
2585420 i think it is another step but for some reason im not really as nervous for that as i was the first two days of practice
2585421 i feel like ive got my feet under me and ive definitely got my confidence back my timing and rhythm are back so i feel this will be easier
2585422 im sure ill be nervous but i think im more excited than anything right now
2585423 i cant think about it that way or i lose track of whats really going to go down he said im just going to focus on my part and however many drives i get just make the best of it
2585424 i got to do the two minute drill at the end of practice even doing the scout team stuff just getting out there and throwing

2585475 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2585476 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2585477 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2585478 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2585479 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2585480 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2585481 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2585482 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2585483 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds

2585531 i was out on post checks when i met airman mohiadeen

2585533 i think its really cool to see people who have immigrated to the united states serving their country especially when it means coming back to their homeland
2585534 i thought it was as good as theyve played all spring
2585535 i think i am more motivated than in the past
2585536 not even just because of the national championship hopes or anything like that i just know what kind of talent we have i know what kind of hard work it takes
2585537 he is strong he has got size he is the quickest guy we have got off the football
2585538 im certainly disappointed in a few of our players who have made poor decisions during the offseason it is of great concern and we take it very seriously they will be dealt with accordingly and will pay a price each one will be disciplined based on the severity of their actions
2585539 julio b j marquis maze hanks all of those guys have stepped up their game tremendously everybodys going to contribute this year everybody
2585540 the biggest thing with our receivers right now is weve had guys flash and make a lot of very good plays
2585541 but the thing that we are really emphasizing with the receivers and the passing game is consistency attention to detail the timing involved the spacing involved thats whats going to help us become a more consistent group
2585542 weve had lots of players flash a lot of ability at receiver
2585543 julios going to make some big plays this year he can go up and get it he can run by guys hes going to make some big plays
2585544 theyve both made some great plays those guys are athletic and physical and fast thats all you need for any receiver to make big plays
2585545 i feel like all the receivers we have are playmakers
2585546 all the ones that we do have basically can come in and play any time and when their number is called they can make the play
2585547 biggest groove that makes a click when it goes past it
2585548 i was somebody who didnt think he could play college football until my senior year in high school when i started getting letters from schools
2585549 i dont mean anything by it i wasnt even aware i was popping up off the ground like that until somebody mentioned it
2585550 im not trying to show anybody up or be a hot dog im not
2585551 its the mind set of never giving that defender a chance to think he won that battle
2585552 it may appear to be a demeaning thing but when it gets down to it it is just a sign that you cant hurt me you didnt hurt me
2585553 were trying to take it light on this dude because hes on the scout team and then he hits us like it was a game
2585554 we thought he was using us to make a name for himself or make us look bad in front of the coaches
2585555 i didnt think i would start at all last year
2585556 we had thomas brown and kregg lumpkin and i wasnt thinking about getting in the game much maybe if they needed a blow i got some time and i was just trying to pick up where they left off
2585557 he can burst or explode on contact he energizes in contact situations where a lot of guys stop their feet on contact
2585558 he is not excited about anybody wrapping him up he likes to let them know he was there
2585559 he is going to handle it because he is going to approach each day the way he always has which is not to talk about himself
2585560 thats a good thing the fact he will defer to someone else is a clear example he is thinking about the team
2585561 the song is kind of about that state that youre in at 3am when you dont really know what youre doing

2585580 one of the greatest sentences in the platform is this one on page 22 we recognize that social security is not in crisis and we should do everything we can to strengthen this vital program including asking those making over 250 000 to pay a bit more
2585581 finally the first step in defeating the idiotic repeated theme by the media politicians and elites that social security is in crisis it isnt i consider that sentence to be a huge victory if we can now get people to repeat it

2585590 as a result going into 2008 the united states finds itself in the anomalous position of being unable to pay for its own elevated living standards or its wasteful overly large military establishment

2585593 in discussing the fiscal 2008 defense budget as released on 7 february 2007 i have been guided by two experienced and reliable analysts william d hartung of the new america foundations arms and security initiative and department of defense requested 481
2585594 our excessive military expenditures did not occur over just a few short years or simply because of the bush administrations policies
2585595 with the war added to the pentagons core budget the united states now spends nearly as much on military matters as the of the world combined
2585596 the total pentagon budget represents more than our combined spending on education environmental protection justice administration veterans benefits housing assistance transportation job training agriculture energy and economic development no wonder then that as it collects ever more money the pentagon is taking on or taking over ever more functions and roles
2585597 he regularly disproved contractors claims about new weapons systems though some of the most unecessary have continued to be developed nonetheless
2585598 more vocal than ever in retirement christies insights remain essential to discussions about how to control breakaway military spending
2585599 129 billion for personnel 180 billion for operations and maintenance 104 billion for procurement 80 billion for research and development 24 billion for military construction and 2 billion for management
2585600 but that doesnt come close to how much money eventually will be spent on the military that doesnt include the 165 billion supplemental bill to fund the wars in iraq and afghanistan so youre easily up to 700 billion in this coming fiscal year and a large part of the budget is over in the department of energy

2585612 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2585613 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes

2585616 the result is a strong performance in a highly challenging environment it marks the reward for the hard work that has been invested by all of the lufthanseats and all of the groups companies such as swiss it is the result of careful precautions
2585617 the undoubtedly very good first half result should not allow us to lose sight of the major challenges that lie ahead our company has the great opportunity to emerge relatively stronger from the increasingly difficult market and competition situation that we find ourselves in we have laid the foundations and will not jeopardize our future we have shown in the past that we are prepared for these kinds of situations and are capable of reacting to them our financial strength and operating adaptability will grant us the opportunity to remain profitable and strong and to continue to make our company more attractive for our shareholders customers and employees

2585621 the experimental aircraft association reported that attendance at last weeks airventure held steady despite uncertainty with fuel prices and strength of the north american economy the energy surrounding the entire spectrum of general aviation remains robust our piston manufacturers continue to generate excitement through new product introductions that incorporate innovative technologies and are paying increased attention to growth opportunities in the international market

2585641 however resistance is seen around 4 700 4 800 the nifty is likely to find broad support around 4 200 4 250 the sensex can go up to 18 300 levels before we see deterioration
2585642 a major support is at usd 115 117 per barrel the longer term trend is starting to turn bearish it can go down to usd 93 per barrel
2585643 the action taken by rbi is slightly beyond my expectations i had clearly foreseen a 25 hike in crr as well as in repo inflation growth per se getting moderate is a matter of comfort it is clearly evident that the monetary measures initiated by rbi are yielding the desired results
2585644 it is should be minimum it is evident that money has been made very dear and expensive therefore the whole idea is to contain aggregate demands if it is going to affect our bottomline we will have to go for a minimum of a half percentage revision in plr prime lending rate for the time being but having said that it will augur well for the indian economy if its going to tame inflation at least in the near term because india will still continue with best economic fundamentals will be one of the best climates to invest in the medium term
2585645 i still think that it is on the right track but there are still some concerns that we have to worry about the story of the exchange rate is not yet clear interest rate is one tool to influence inflation but exchange rates are even stronger tool to influence inflation i would have liked to see some changes on the capital control i would have liked to see a reversal of the capital control of 2007 i would have liked to see a programme for sale of reserves we are still not understanding the role of exchange rates in this inflation and i am not seeing that being used adequately the other concern i have is of the distance between the repo and the reverse repo money market conditions could change dramatically and the call could be closer to the bottom of the corridor and we still have a very big gap between the two rates i would have been happier if the gap between the two rates was more like a 100 bps
2585646 i think what is implicit in this monetary policy signal is that the rbi wants lending rates in the system to harden quite a bit more i think on average the median increase in lending rate has been about 50 bps over the last couple of months i think the rbi will make sure that it goes up by another 50 75 bps some banks have sort of pre empted it by going in for larger hikes but the median rate hike is about 50 bps with another additional of 50 bps hike in effective lending rates that i foresee perhaps growth will come off from the 7 8 7 9 median forecast that we have from economists so i think the range could be now between 7 3 and 7 6 so certainly some downward revision is warranted
2585647 i feel that in india the monetary policy transmission is very weak so fairly large changes in the interest rate end dont do all that much to the economy large parts of the economy just dont care about what happens to the policy rates
2585648 so while i am the first to say that in combating inflation we need strong real rates at the short end and we are not there yet
2585649 we should bear in mind that this kind of rate action will take 12 24 months for the economy to feel the pain of this inflow so it is going to have bigger impact on the following years fiscal year growth then in the current year
2585650 i think to be fair the rbi is probably is taking a slightly broader perspective thinking about consumer price inflation monetary growth credit growth aggregate demand current account positions fiscal positions i think they are taking this broad picture the message that they are taking is that the economy is continuing to grow rapidly and needs to slowdown and until we get that slowdown we cant be confident on those bottlenecks and those underlying inflation and signs of excess will be diminished
2585651 despite the temporary reprieve on oil prices the rbi is very concerned about inflation so whether they did the repo rate hike now or in august inflation spiking up again is the only issue my sense was that over the rest of the year they would have to do between a 50 to 100 basis points increase in the repo rate
2585652 so i think there maybe more rate hikes but i dont believe the repo rate is likely to go up by a 200 or 250 basis points which some economists and bond houses have been forecasting so i am forecasting another 50 to 75 maximum additional repo rate increase
2585653 i am looking for another 50 bps repo rate hike from here and 70 bps on the crr rate before the end of this calendar year i think there is a bit more to come and these kinds of moves will be triggered by further move up in inflationary pressure in wpi inflation and also the fact that i expect both monetary growth and credit growth to remain above target over that kind of period
2585654 with the inevitable reversionary interest rates credit growth will naturally get moderated and we will also fall in line with the rbi policy to be more cautious in credit expansion because otherwise if we do not contain aggregate demand the whole exercise will become futile with inflation management being the focus area when the rbi is seeing the market responding to the measures taken by them definitely the intensity has increased
2585655 that means the government wants the inflation to get tamed rather than inflation growth getting moderated there is a distinct difference between the two we are going to the taming zone which is very necessary it will auger very well for the indian economy in the medium term
2585656 we are in a scenario where people are taking macro calls and moving out rather than looking at micro numbers the expectation of the market for eps growth is probably between 10 12 depending upon the current valuation
2585657 we have a central bank which is alive and functioning and trying to control inflationary expectation within its mandate so medium term it will definitely enhance the creditability of indian economic environment
2585658 market wasnt prepared for this this is an aggressive stance on tightening the monetary policy whereas most economists and experts believed that inflation is because of pass through of crude oil prices global inflation and supply side constrains so most people thought that that doesnt warrant this kind of tightening which will hurt growth for sure so market particularly banking stocks and financials have come under heavy fire from bears which were expected but i think maybe market will now seek level between 13 000 14 500 and we do not see any upside or any major trigger which can take the market up in this environment
2585659 we are likely to see sideways trade in india for the near term indian valuations are now reasonable so we may see more fii inflows
2585660 there is a low probability of prices slipping below usd 100 per barrel
2585661 we are likely to see improvement in inflationary expectations in q4 cy08
2585662 it is premature to forecast an easing in interest rate policy we are likely to see rate cuts only by early next year
2585663 however we may see mediocre growth numbers we see 1 growth rate for us economy
2585664 we may see some more write downs in select banks

2585690 there are certain times during the course of a season where exceptions should be made for night games on weekends
2585691 not all the time but look at the schedule and there are a handful of games where youre coming in late in the morning like when we came in from arizona at 5 a m you could use a night game on friday to get your breath a little bit

2585702 all of us at drexel have an interest in making this the best place it can be

2585705 in order for me to like a job i need three things
2585706 i need to have a feeling of mutual respect between myself and my co workers i need to be able to trust the people i am working with and i need to have a sense of accomplishment
2585707 to be honest i dont worry about these things how long interim means or whether there is a search for another provost i am tenured at the university i could go back to being the honors dean or even teaching students both of which are some of the best jobs here
2585708 we hope that the publicity in national geographic will convince the government of equatorial guinea that these animals are worth saving if that message is successful then the national geographic article will have been worth the effort
2585709 the loss of biodiversity is clearly the greatest catastrophe of our times and of times for the years to come it seemed important to me as a biologist to try to do something
2585710 i am on bioko about five times a year up to three to four weeks per trip but i spend more than 80 percent of my time here in philadelphia i believe teaching should include lots of real life information the bioko biodiversity protection program is a good example of one of the efforts being made worldwide to save biodiversity i incorporate these examples into my teaching to show that drexel is doing something about the biodiversity crisis not just teaching about it
2585711 most programs like this one never accomplish anything much less get to the stage where recognition is due survival is more the mode we never expected to get this far
2585712 there is no evidence that the amount of students eating at the handschumacher dining center will decrease
2585713 today we re celebrating 150 years of oil from oil springs which is 150 years of oil for the world
2585714 this is the site of the world s first commercial oil well it s also the site of canada s first refinery and the site of the world s first registered petroleum company
2585715 we had everything from fire trucks to the kids on bikes old vehicles we even had a modern day tank truck that carries the oil of here to this very day
2585716 nylon lipstick gasoline and glue we use oil in most things its true
2585717 because oil makes life s things today what will we do when it runs out someday
2585718 we ve got enough national and provincial and world firsts that we think this site and the oil heritage district of lambton county warrants world heritage status
2585719 we always look to see if we can match them suspects to other robberies
2585720 we are blessed with vocations and their educational backgrounds and interests are important to us we dont take them to turn them into a standard dominican product but there is a strong dominican formation and that is a strong intellectual formation
2585721 but of course because truth is one there will be a common core of understanding and an appreciation of the economy of salvation in the catholic church
2585722 we were founded to combat against the albigensian heresy an essentially dualist heresy which separated the body from the soul our contemporary world suffers from a similar sort of sense of separation and the dominican way of life which offers a coherent whole has never been more necessary
2585723 we are a hinge between the apostolic tradition and the monastic tradition because we live together pray together but also go out and preach the truth of the gospel
2585724 because people deserve to have sense made or to be helped to make sense themselves of the faith that has been revealed to us
2585725 people deserve to hear a good sermon for that to be done it doesnt just take pastoral experience it means hard thinking hard studying about theology to think well about theology requires the study of philosophy as well
2585726 as dominicans we have a passion for truth but that has got to involve learning that things are often more complicated than we think and as a kind of fundamental dominican asceticism which is detachment from that which isnt wholly true actually surrendering some of our prejudices our half truths the shorthand we often live by we have to be prepared to give that up and focus on the truth of what god has revealed and thinking hard about it really
2585727 theres a kind of sympathetic hearing which then has to lead to critical reflection its not saying everythings true when patently some things are not but it serves to work out what the truth is
2585728 if you look at st thomass summa he is very much interested in the objections that are going to be put forward its allowing the objections to sharpen up ones sense of what the correct answer is
2585729 the ideal thing about the order was the balance between the contemplative and the active because id approached catholicism through the monastic lens that sort of thing seemed very attractive to me yet i recognised that i have that sort of extrovert side that i would really want to go out and do something with that contemplation
2585730 we all should be looking forward to the challenges going into a place like that takes you out of your comfort zone but thats exactly what we are supposed to do i really feel that we wouldnt be effective in our preaching mission if we didnt do that
2585731 to help them see the connection between their studies and pastoral care that the studies are not just for an academic purpose but that they are preparing them for the mission the way we do it always requires study because its a preaching and a theological mission wherever we do it
2585732 we can preach a message there that there is a way forward through christ and we give them as much help as we can if its one to one catechesis thats required or something like that or just to generally talk about faith
2585733 we are willing to do ceasefire immediately provide the other side stops to shoot and to bomb
2585734 and we are willing to disengage disengage immediately and as soon as they stop shoot ing at us were willing to take any steps first steps required for us
2585735 we urge the georgian authorities to immediately stop their aggression against south ossetia to stop all violations of all standing agreements on a ceasefire and to respect the legal rights and interests of other people
2585736 the response has been far disproportionate from whatever threat russia was citing
2585737 we are calling for an immediate ceasefire and a stand down of all troops
2585738 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2585739 stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone
2585740 to urgently convene a meeting of the european council at the level of heads of government
2585741 the territorial integrity of georgia is currently being violated on an enormous scale
2585742 there are bombardments civilians are dying foreign military forces are on georgian territory
2585743 the eu and nato must take the initiative and stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy in the east of europe
2585744 the russian federation has overstepped a red line in keeping the peace and stability in the conflict zone and in protecting russian citizens outside its own borders
2585745 in this sense it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action
2585746 eve is basically a ongoing symbiotic process perhaps this means the developer has to make some unpopular decisions for the good of the process as a whole the relationship between player and developer is not one of equals nor is it always at its best when it is entirely amiable
2585747 we wanted someone who would know about conservation and cataloging and curating exhibitions and bringing attention to the collection engaging it in the classroom for the design programs raise the profile on and off the campus but we also wanted someone who teaches
2585748 if you have a chanel from the 20s and a chanel from the 60s you can see the differences
2585749 in my position at fit the museum employees were considered staff so you didnt have the opportunity to teach i had something that i could give that i wasnt being allowed to give so here i get to teach and work with a really cool collection
2585750 every day that i am in here i discover something that is amazing and exciting and that is really very worthwhile to me
2585751 the games have always brought people together in peace to respect universal moral principles
2585752 its kind of hard at time seeing the patients downstairs in the media room but it puts things into perspective
2585753 its the act a great initiative what it could mean is that study abroad will be more accessible for students that may not have the financial means which is often something that prevents students from going
2585754 students shouldnt have to pay extra money it shouldnt be a burden to study abroad it would be great if there was more financial aid
2585755 if you have to take out a loan take it out because youre not really going to get this opportunity in the future
2585756 how the act will really play out is unknown its easy for the government to say we would like 10 percent of our student population to go overseas but you need resources for that if i suddenly tell a student you need to pay for your airfare and that airfare is 1 000 is the simon act going to subsidize that its a great idea but its very complicated
2585757 you think its like this but its really like this
2585758 one of drexels missions especially going forward is to increase undergraduate research
2585759 drexel is one of the few universities in the country that has undergraduate research for freshmen
2585760 i didnt think id be doing this for a summer job i would have thought id be working in a grocery store
2585761 it seemed like a natural thing to create a retail store that catered to the needs of this growing demographic while also providing education and support in terms of healthy body image and proper body care
2585762 status quo is latin for the mess we are in
2585763 hes a nice horse and ten furlongs is the right trip for him
2585764 when he won his maiden he beat the filly who won the irish oaks moonstone and she is obviously top class
2585765 i probably made a mistake by running him over a mile and a half in the irish derby as it was too far for him and that is why i brought him back to ten furlongs
2585766 i think hes a very progressive horse and i will need to discuss it with the owners but dont be surprised if you see him come back for the breeders cup turf
2585767 i was never travelling i was pushing along about five eighths out
2585768 when i got into the straight and it all opened up for me he ran home well but in tight he just didnt like it
2585769 for the muslim masses basic islamic education in the quran hadith and sira may create an immutable superstructure of jew hatred on to which non muslim sources of jew hatred are easily grafted
2585770 this clearly shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets in georgia
2585771 um governo submetido a ch vez e ao ir n o tem nada de bom a conseguir
2585772 o governo de morales se abra ar outra vez com ch vez e com o ir que um pa s p ria que est com um programa de armamento nuclear que financia o terrorismo de estado
2585773 infelizmente minha conclus o que ser muito dif cil se n o imposs vel encontrar pontos de coincid ncia suficientes para elaborar uma declara o conjunta
2585774 well since you asked i guess i can say that it could be worse
2585775 a r ssia utilizou os bombardeiros mais potentes de seu arsenal a reo e lan ou ataques com m sseis bal sticos em territ rio georgiano
2585776 estamos pedindo um cessar fogo imediato e a retirada de todas as tropas
2585777 se a parte russa quer seguir pressionando com o ataque militar n o h muito que os georgianos possam fazer est o sendo atacados duramente por isso temos que confiar na diplomacia
2585778 n o estamos falando de nada al m da diplomacia por enquanto

2585785 i guess they dont typically seem like former law school professors eh
2585786 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2585787 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2585788 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2585789 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2585790 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2585791 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2585792 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings

2585872 ketahuilah bahwa sesungguhnya kehidupan dunia itu hanyalah permainan dan suatu yang melalaikan perhiasan dan bermegah megah antara kamu serta berbangga banggaan tentang banyaknya harta dan anak seperti hujan yang tanaman tanamannya mengagumkan para petani kemudian tanaman itu menjadi kering dan kamu lihat warnanya kuning kemudian menjadi hancur dan di akhirat nanti ada adzab yang keras dan ampunan dari allah serta keridloannya dan kehidupan dunia ini tidak lain hanyalah kesenangan yang menipu
2585873 barangsiapa yang menghendaki kehidupan dunia dan perhiasannya niscaya kami berikan kepada mereka balasan pekerjaan mereka di dunia dengan sempurna dan mereka di dunia itu tidak akan dirugikan itulah orang orang yang tidak memperoleh di akhirat kecuali neraka dan lenyaplah di akhirat itu apa yang mereka telah usahakan di dunia dan sia sialah apa yang telah mereka kerjakan
2585874 maka hendaklah orang orang yang menyalahi perintah rasul takut akan ditimpa cobaan atau ditimpa adzab yang pedih
2585875 dan aku tidak menciptakan jin dan manusia melainkan supaya mereka menyembah ku
2585876 setiap perintah beribadah dalam al quran maka maknanya adalah tauhid
2585877 sesungguhnya allah meridhai kalian tiga perkara kalian beribadah kepada nya dan tidak menyekutukan nya dengan sesuatu apapun berpegang teguh dengan tali allah semuanya dan jangan bercerai berai dan memberikan nasihat kepada orang yang allah jadikan pemimpin atas urusan urusan kalian
2585878 sesungguhnya kami telah mengutus rasul rasul kami dengan membawa bukti bukti yang nyatam dan telah kami turunkan bersama mereka al kitab dan neraca keadilan supaya manusia dapat melaksanakan keadilan
2585879 orang orang yang beriman dan tidak mencampuradukkan iman mereka dengan kezhaliman syirik mereka itulah orang orang yang mendapat keamanan dan mereka itu adalah orang orang yang mendapat petunjuk
2585880 yaitu mereka yang memurnikan ibadahnya untuk allah saja dan tidak berbuat kesyirikan dengan sesuatu apapun mereka mendapatkan keamanan pada hari kiamat dan petunjuk di dunia dan akhirat
2585881 dan allah telah berjanji kepada orang orang yang beriman di antara kamu dan mengerjakan amal amal yang sholih bahwa dia sungguh sungguh akan menjadikan mereka berkuasa di muka bumi sebagaimana dia telah menjadikan orang orang yang sebelum mereka berkuasa dan sungguh dia akan meneguhkan bagi mereka agama yang telah diridhainya untuk mereka dan dia benar benar akan menukar keadaan mereka semula mereka berada dalam ketakutan menjadi aman sentosa mereka tetap menyembah ku dengan tiada mempersekutukan sesuatu apapun dengan aku dan barangsiapa yang kafir sesudah janji itu maka mereka itulah orang orang yang fasik
2585882 barangsiapa yang bertemu allah dalam keadaan tidak menyekutukan nya dengan sesuatu apapun ia akan masuk surga dan barangsiapa yang bertemu dengan nya dalam keadaan menyekutukan nya ia akan masuk neraka
2585883 aku diperintahkan untuk memerangi manusia hingga mereka bersaksi bahwa tiada ilah yang berhak untuk diibadahi secara benar kecuali allah dan bahwa muhammad itu utusan allah menegakkan sholat menunaikan zakat jika mereka melakukannya mereka terjaga dariku darahnya dan hartanya kecuali dengan hak hak islam dan perhitungannya atas allah

2585889 how can christians in this land of high privileges sit easy and unconcerned without contributing out of their abundance to spread the gospel in distant pagan lands my soul is grieved for them in their ignorance oh how i wish i was so circumstanced in life as that i might be able to bear the gospel into some distant pagan lands where it never yet has shined a large part of the american continent is also involved in darkness yes under the immediate government of the united states there is an abundant field for missionary labor how i should rejoice if providence would open a door for my usefulness and labors in this way but alas how idle and vain are my thoughts in this place i am too faithless too prone to wander oh that i might first learn to perform the duties which come within my reach and not presume to think i should be more faithful in another part of the vineyard
2585890 and the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting and the children of israel also wept again and said who shall give us flesh to eat
2585891 so also when we happen to be in company with those who indulge in the wicked practice of speaking against the lords people if we cannot succeed in changing the current of the conversation let us rise and leave the place thus bearing testimony against that which is so hateful to christ let us never sit by and listen to a backbiter we may rest assured he is doing the work of the devil and inflicting positive injury upon three distinct parties namely himself his hearer and the subject of his censorious remarks

2585902 is a man made dogma that has no origins nor basis in the scriptures
2585903 stupid stitions as i calll them which have no basis in fact nor scripture
2585904 everything with 666 on it is evil and im going to die ahhh
2585905 were written to mean the words written in the book of revelation and not all scripture in general

2585920 i cant be the only one who tivoed the opening ceremony and channel surfed between fox news channel and cnn as the talking heads and tabloid reporters waxed hours about edwards turpitude
2585921 then yesterdays news tsunami hit of course the edwards sit down with bob woodruff was a political calculation edwards thought he might bury the lead in all those fireworks and waving flags that didnt happen the us media finally pounced edwards had to publicly admit to the affair with rielle hunter on abcs nightline to make the respectability door open so that all media would appear like the tabloids for his part edwards was still probably hoping we were looking for jennie finch and yao ming in the stands he did tell woodruff he never loved her now hunters family is calling for an immediate paternity test to prove that his glove doesnt fit conception timeline is way off doesnt edwards know that you shouldnt have a sexual affair with a woman and then report to the world that you never loved her thats something to keep to yourself unless you want to generate some hell fury

2585924 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2585925 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2585926 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2585927 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2585928 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2585929 it feels like its about the right time to be making a new record
2585930 maybe thats because the black parade was talked about for so long before it was released but it feels like that albums been out for a long time now were already on our fourth single and weve played a lot of shows
2585931 the black parade was the kind of record that you make but dont necessarily have a burning desire to perform because its creation was almost the point
2585932 it was such an intense experience to make it that there was almost a feeling of wanting to move on as soon as we released it it was so artistically ambitious that it made us want to keep on creating
2585933 while we were slow dancing my crush and i had our first kiss

2585935 rusia ha utilizado los bombarderos m s potentes del arsenal a reo ruso y ha lanzado ataques con misiles bal sticos en territorio georgiano
2585936 estamos pidiendo un alto el fuego inmediato y la retirada de todas las tropas
2585937 si la parte rusa quiere seguir presionando con el ataque militar no hay mucho que puedan hacer los georgianos est n siendo atacados duramente por lo que tenemos que confiar en la diplomacia
2585938 no estamos hablando de algo m s all de la diplomacia por el momento
2585939 se ha especulado sobre si el motivo por el que rusia ha utilizado este desproporcionado uso de la fuerza contra georgia es precisamente porque no quiere verla avanzar hacia la otan
2585940 esa ser a una posibilidad comprensible por parte de rusia pero totalmente inaceptable para nosotros

2585943 i just hope it gets people into comic book stores who wouldnt normally go there thats a success to me thats why im finally happy to talk about it in music magazines because the point is to show people who arent into comics how much great stuff there is out there comics are a struggling art form im really psyched about it
2585944 i dont really care how big it gets thats irrelevant to me
2585945 that means that ive been able to write it artistically and without thinking about it selling a lot thats the most important thing its how we write music too fortunately the two seem to have gone hand in hand im quite lucky that way im really enjoying doing this thats the important thing
2585946 my rotator cuffs are definitely fatigued its a lot of over arm recovery
2585947 were raising money for swim scholarships and our adaptive swim program that helps people who have a physical or developmental disability learn to swim
2585948 i have to say im in my 40s so i was definitely inspired by dara torres i mean being 41 and competing in the olympics thats impressive
2585949 i wasnt out to win anything today i mean for me swimming is a practice
2585950 you have to eat a lot before you go the night before i had a lot of pasta bread pizza and then the morning before i had a bagel and a powerbar and a lot of water
2585951 humanism leads me to find a sense of wider relatedness with all the world and its peoples and it calls me to work for a sound environment and a humane civilization humanism also makes me aware of the existence of moral dilemmas and the need to be very careful and intentional in my moral decision making
2585952 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief and for my own part i disbelieve them all
2585953 the christian religion is a parody on the worship of the sun in which they put a man called christ in the place of the sun and pay him the adoration originally payed to the sun
2585954 i am a christian in the only sense he wished any one to be sincerely attached to his doctrines in preference to all others ascribing to himself every human excellence amp believing he never claimed any other
2585955 we have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other
2585956 the great vital and conservative element in our system is the belief of our people in the pure doctrines and divine truths of the gospel of jesus christ
2585957 sport has the power to change the world it can give hope were there once was despair
2585958 with that usa team patch on your chest with those white rings underneath its a pretty powerful symbol
2585959 ralph lauren was a good choice for the american team though the polo ponies embroidered on the lapels of the athletes blue blazers were almost as large as the olympic rings lauren has never been known for his subtlety
2585960 white pants are among the most difficult things in all of fashiondom to pull off and true to form these didnt flatter a few pleats would have helped the white newsboy caps were a nice touch broadcasting a can do spirit especially on basketball player kobe bryant who cocked his to the side
2585961 the omani women have won the competition for wearing the most glitter not to mention high heeled shoes
2585962 the netherlands team looked jaunty too in light colored suits with white piping and cheerful orange neckties
2585963 but the british were the best dressed in an that combined a dark button down shirt and pants with a white jacket striped belt and vans style slip on sneakers
2585964 meanwhile hunky swiss tennis player roger federer was reduced to wearing a cream polo shirt with a graphic that resembled a lower back tattoo
2585965 refubnished studios in the basement with lighting simulating natural light
2585966 the great wall and the firewall the government has set up to keep information and ideas out of the country
2585967 to make a woman march with the flag of the islamic republic in beijing is pure heresy and shows total disobedience of the laws mandated by our spiritual guides

2585969 mr darwish has died at 1 35 pm 1835 gmt
2585970 it is clear that he did record some of our conversations but at no time did he inform me that he was doing so or seek my permission
2585971 i plan to consult counsel about the legality of his action
2585972 the white house had concocted a fake letter from the director of the iraqi intelligence service tahir jalil habbush al tikriti to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
2585973 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
2585974 they secretly resettled habbush in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
2585975 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2585976 probably passed through five or six people george tenet probably showed it to me but then passed it probably to jim pavitt the cias deputy director of operations who then passed it down to his chief of staff who passed it to me cause thats how you know so i saw the original i got a copy of it
2585977 statement and my absolute belief that the charges outlined in mr suskinds book regarding agency involvement in forging documents are not true
2585978 during my time as a senior officer i saw many documents from various offices of the white house regarding many topics
2585979 they were in fact on white paper i was asked to respond to documents regarding the potential use of habbush upon his defection and during the difficult fall of 2003 when we were wrestling with a developing iraqi insurgency and ways to combat it i was also involved in many queries from elements of the administration trying to document an and saddam government link proof of which was never found many of such queries did originate from the staff of the office of the vice president none of this however substantiates mr suskinds explosive allegation
2585980 it is important to note however in the transcript just released i make no mention of having received an order to fabricate the letter as claimed by mr
2585981 far from being comfortable i told mr suskind that many of the things he wrote about what i did and said were wrong
2585982 mr suskind appears to have conflated two separate conversations one about the problems of reading saddam husseins intentions an issue which is dealt with in the butler report and one about habbush
2585983 i made it clear to mr suskind that i was in no position to comment on the substance or significance of any dealing with the latter since i had not been privy to the detail of what had taken place something mr suskind has chosen not to mention and in any event i had made it clear to mr suskind when first he approached me that i would not divulge classified information to which i had had access during my time in government
2585984 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
2585985 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
2585986 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
2585987 from the very beginning there was a conviction that saddam hussein was a bad person and that he needed to go
2585988 from the very first instance it was about iraq it was about what we can do to change this regime
2585989 psp 2 but it does have some nice essentials that last didnt the main features are
2585990 marks injury is not as bad as a lot of people feared it was so well take the reps until he gets back and well see what happens then
2585991 im happy for mark that the injury is not as serious as it could have been
2585992 but my thinking hasnt changed at all im still going to compete for first team reps
2585993 its the same kind of opportunity just shortened a little i guess
2585994 i was empty at the end just in terms of fuel i just havent had seven hour rides
2585995 the guy that i raced today wasnt the guy who won the tours so i dont put myself in that category
2585996 but it was great of him to come out and do this race and to race with all the people hes a class act out there it was fun we didnt talk a whole lot because it seemed like it was pretty much business
2585997 at the end i realized i was thoroughly cooked but i said i am having a good time
2585998 thats why i wanted to come out here i didnt expect to beat this guy so i just wanted to have something out there to shoot for train for stay in shape for and it was a blast it really was
2585999 i wont come back unless im in shape and i feel like im in decent shape you cant show up to this race if youre not in shape so it just depends on how i train id love to be back
2586000 i dont know what happened its got to be flattened by now it was squishing all over
2586001 that was a product of lance and i being together
2586002 it was lances idea i would have never considered that
2586003 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2586004 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

2586006 i think there are two important aspects to the glitter graphic phenomenon
2586007 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2586008 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2586009 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2586010 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2586011 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2586012 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2586013 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2586014 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2586015 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2586016 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2586017 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2586018 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2586019 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2586020 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2586021 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2586022 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2586023 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2586024 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2586025 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2586026 i was empty at the end just in terms of fuel i just havent had seven hour rides
2586027 the guy that i raced today wasnt the guy who won the tours so i dont put myself in that category
2586028 but it was great of him to come out and do this race and to race with all the people hes a class act out there it was fun we didnt talk a whole lot because it seemed like it was pretty much business
2586029 at the end i realised i was thoroughly cooked but i said i am having a good time
2586030 thats why i wanted to come out here i didnt expect to beat this guy so i just wanted have something out there to shoot for train for stay in shape for and it was a blast it really was
2586031 i wont come back unless im in shape and i feel like im in decent shape you cant show up to this race if youre not in shape so it just depends on how i train id love to be back
2586032 mardys a good player but i didnt let him do anything today
2586033 im so happy to be in my first hardcourt final id love to win another title i actually prefer hardcourt more than clay my coach has taught me that he has changed my mind my game everything
2586034 if its roddick it will be a good match for me i just have to try and return his serve
2586035 to ensure stability authorities have strengthened controls on non residents to root out trouble and stepped up controls on key people religious figures and trouble making petitioners to stay abreast of things
2586036 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2586037 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2586038 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2586039 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2586040 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2586041 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2586042 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2586043 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2586044 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2586045 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2586046 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2586047 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2586048 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2586049 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2586050 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2586051 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2586052 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2586053 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2586054 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2586055 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2586056 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2586057 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2586058 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2586059 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2586060 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2586061 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2586062 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2586063 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2586064 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2586065 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2586066 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2586067 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2586068 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2586069 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2586070 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2586071 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2586072 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2586073 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2586074 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2586075 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2586076 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2586077 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2586078 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2586079 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2586080 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2586081 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2586082 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2586083 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2586084 we are talking about a carcinogen that could be reduced in baby foods from the results presented here it is apparent that inorganic arsenic levels in baby rice should be of concern
2586085 i think manufacturers are going to have to start letting people know what levels of arsenic are in their products
2586086 with joy you will draw water from the wells of the saviour

2586111 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2586112 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2586113 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2586114 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2586115 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2586116 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2586117 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2586118 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2586119 unless the country is protected dharma cannot be protected and unless dharma is protected the country cannot be protected also protect the dharmi to protect dharma and remember hindu vote is sacred never barter it away this should be our refrain campaign all over india at this critical juncture we should demand follow up action on the historic every ascetic movement since the time of the buddha has left india weaker and for an obvious reason renunciation of life is one thing to make life itself national individual world life greater and divine is another you cannot enforce one ideal on the country without weakening of the other you cannot take away the best souls from life and yet leave life stronger and greater renunciation of ego acceptance of god in life is the yoga i teach no other renunciation

2586129 understand that in this whole negotiation process our governments failed us our intellectuals failed us and our unions failed us because we were prepared to sit down and listen to the garbage coming out of europe about free trade without really examining what they were doing
2586130 we seem to have a kind of reluctance on the part of the state to help out ailing industries flagship industries that make a difference to our economies
2586131 we keep on reading the script that europeans signed us they tell us dont subsidise
2586132 the europeans i understand owe us nothing but we owe ourselves something in terms of trying to define the region in a manner that we see fit
2586133 and that is why i am one of the persons that shun this deal we were basically given a bad deal by our negotiators because what we sought to do was to appease europeans idea of development without pushing our own model of development
2586134 today is an exciting day for the democratic party as we adopt our national platform renewing americas promise which will be presented at the democratic convention in denver

2586141 saben ma ana subir la t rifa simplemente porque se nos acabo la plata que teniamos en la caja de cart n
2586142 ya vimos como se hace ahora nada m s es cuesti n de que nos pira emos el proceso sin pagar derechos
2586143 porqu pagar a alguien que te haga el trabajo que tu quieres si podr as tener a alguien que te lo pagara
2586144 yo creo que ayer el se or montilla incurri en un exceso verbal
2586145 no se puede decir que se quiere cumplir un plazo legal presentando una propuesta incompleta que no se ajusta a los principios de la misma ley
2586146 trabajando para tener un modelo de financiaci n antes de que se voten las enmiendas a la totalidad de los presupuestos generales del estado
2586147 yo quiero pensar que tendremos unos presupuestos del estado tan respetuosos con el modelo de financiaci n que propone el estatut que no tendremos ning n problema en votarlo
2586148 queremos un buen acuerdo no aceptaremos un mal acuerdo ni un acuerdo a cualquier precio
2586149 preservar la unidad es fundamental con ciu pero tambi n con el resto de formaciones pol ticas para intentar compartir planteamientos
2586150 no romperemos la baraja pero no aceptaremos que nos hagan trampas
2586151 pasar a la historia como el m s falso de espa a por prometer una cosa y hacer la contraria
2586152 no aceptaremos nunca un mal acuerdo nos hemos de conjurar en hacer pi a desde todas las fuerzas pol ticas catalanas que nadie tenga la tentaci n de poner freno a las aspiraciones de catalu a este estatut ya fue negociado no se trata de hacer una segunda negociaci n
2586153 ten an que saber ya cu l era la situaci n econ mica de espa a
2586154 siempre hay indicadores que avisan de lo que est a punto de ocurrir
2586155 ahora continu es obvio que zapatero minti durante la campa a electoral cuando neg que espa a estaba en crisis y llam antipatriotas a los que advert amos de que las cosas en econom a se iban a poner peor
2586156 por lo tanto durante la campa a electoral zapatero minti doblemente fue un mentiroso cuando dijo que en espa a no hab a crisis econ mica porque ya sab a que la hab a y fue un mentiroso cuando se comprometi a intentar alcanzar el pleno empleo porque seg n su vicepresidente econ mico ya ten a que saber que eso no lo iba a poder cumplir
2586157 y zapatero fue claramente indecente durante la campa a cuando no cont la verdad a los espa oles ni sobre la situaci n econ mica ni sobre las posibilidades que ten a su programa electoral
2586158 nos gustar a que se dejase ayudar y para eso no vamos a parar de proponerle nuevas medidas y nuevas cosas que se pueden hacer
2586159 tan de izquierdas que en s lo un a o ha conseguido que espa a tenga n meros rojos
2586160 no obstante todas las medidas razonables que zapatero proponga el pp las va apoyar y adem s el pp va a proponer sus propias medidas y le gustar a que zapatero aceptase alguna
2586161 ese dinero es m s del doble de lo que en el presente marco de crisis el gobierno zapatero quer a gastarse en la compra de solares para construir viviendas de protecci n oficial por qu no suprimimos esa partida de gasto se pregunt eso es austeridad
2586162 estoy convencido de que zapatero podr a pasar con muchos menos asesores y con mucho menos personal de confianza
2586163 son los que le dijeron que no hab a crisis
2586164 hay muchas partidas que podr a reducir quit ndose a lo mejor un poco de grandeza pero adapt ndose a la situaci n que est n viviendo millones de espa oles
2586165 no debe tocar ninguna partida de gasto social por m s que zapatero pueda tener la tentaci n de tocarlas manifest el gasto social en espa a lo hacen las comunidades aut nomas que son las prestan servicios de sanidad educaci n o asistencia social
2586166 we hebben de hele week hard getraind en dan moet je in dit stadium van de voorbereiding niet twee keer binnen 24 uur vol aan de bak gaan

2586187 our heart goes out to the two tigers who had to endure the long trip to iraq and a dangerous future at the baghdad zoo
2586188 these tigers will be caged helpless and completely dependent on humans to survive in an area where many people live in fear and are still without access to basic necessities

2586193 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2586194 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2586195 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2586196 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2586197 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you

2586199 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2586200 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2586201 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977

2586203 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2586204 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2586205 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2586206 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large

2586209 made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2586210 he has been driven to be outspoken by the appalling prospect of his silence in the wake of worsening chinese repression
2586211 were trying to make it clear that they need to step it up
2586212 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2586213 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2586214 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2586215 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2586216 from a legal point of view our actions are absolutely well founded and legitimate and moreover necessary
2586217 i was empty at the end just in terms of fuel i just havent had seven hour rides
2586218 the guy that i raced today wasnt the guy who won the tours so i dont put myself in that category
2586219 but it was great of him to come out and do this race and to race with all the people hes a class act out there it was fun we didnt talk a whole lot because it seemed like it was pretty much business
2586220 at the end i realised i was thoroughly cooked but i said i am having a good time
2586221 thats why i wanted to come out here i didnt expect to beat this guy so i just wanted have something out there to shoot for train for stay in shape for and it was a blast it really was
2586222 i wont come back unless im in shape and i feel like im in decent shape you cant show up to this race if youre not in shape so it just depends on how i train id love to be back
2586223 to ensure stability authorities have strengthened controls on non residents to root out trouble and stepped up controls on key people religious figures and trouble making petitioners to stay abreast of things
2586224 mardys a good player but i didnt let him do anything today
2586225 im so happy to be in my first hardcourt final id love to win another title i actually prefer hardcourt more than clay my coach has taught me that he has changed my mind my game everything
2586226 if its roddick it will be a good match for me i just have to try and return his serve
2586227 have you caught the flow its spreading like mad throughout the
2586228 nothing that exists is absolutely worthy of love so we must love what does not exist
2586229 if i say i exist then i must say god does not exist for existence then is word which describes the created
2586230 ok sweetie heres the wax not too hot is it
2586231 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2586232 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2586233 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2586234 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2586235 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2586236 they told me that i was a hero and that they wished they could do the same in their countries
2586237 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2586238 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2586239 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2586240 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2586241 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2586242 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2586243 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2586244 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2586245 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2586246 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men
2586247 if anyone asks a man that he will slap you

2586274 i am a stay at home mom who needs a break from the 17 month old that i call my son he is very active and keeps me very busy my husband and i recently relocated with his job

2586279 reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage
2586280 madeleine came here for lunch with her parents not long before she disappeared
2586281 i dont know if this guy took a picture of madeleine its impossible to say but he took a lot of photographs on the beach
2586282 the police said they had had complaints about a man acting strangely on the beaches they thought he might have been a watcher a voyeur they told me to get in touch if i saw him again but i never saw him after that
2586283 they came a lot but i only saw the mccann family here once
2586284 i saw the little blemish in her right eye she really stood out she was the absolute image of the missing madeleine
2586285 i was afraid to do anything i decided to get a good look to make sure it was her so i could report it
2586286 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2586287 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2586288 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2586289 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2586290 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2586291 war is never a good thing no one wants it
2586292 they understood the hiroshima bombing because of the japanese military
2586293 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2586294 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2586295 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries

2586327 i was able to obtain copies of the photographs from the photographer tyler cobbs
2586328 to my delight he was very cooperative in providing me with the color photos which i use today in my displays to inform others and receive support as we voice our concerns
2586329 the signs are also particularly poignant for the various ute tribes and bands that were forcibly relocated to various reservations in the state of utah and colorado
2586330 although the university of utah no longer endorses the ute name as a mascot but rather as a nickname for its athletic teams unfortunately with the continued use of the ute name many fans of rival universitys take up the name an use it in a racist hostile and abusive contexts
2586331 native people are always being stereotyped and the more schools use native people or images as a mascot it opens doors for bigotry and racial discrimination
2586332 i was very surprised he treated our request with such blankness
2586333 i am still waiting for a phone call or letter regarding our request to meet with president samuelson or tom holmoe
2586334 the comments of this single fan certainly do not represent the views of the byu athletic department nor of the university i apologize for the distress that her remarks displayed however briefly have caused you and any others we will continue to encourage our fans to demonstrate good sportsmanship and respect for all people
2586335 i would have been happy to explain our response to this incident and our feelings about it if you had contacted me before you launched your petition drive
2586336 i immediately mailed an apology to the people who contacted me regarding this issue i had not heard of the incident until i received the letter
2586337 tom holmoe forwarded me your inquiry your questions are answered in the response that tom sent the petitioners on july 16 after the first time he heard from them
2586338 we wholeheartedly agree with you and your petitioners that these particular remarks were inappropriate and offensive that is why our staff intervened as soon as they saw them and told the fan they must be erased
2586339 after she wrote another offensive phrase our staff informed her she could not display the dry erase board at all and enforced this requirement for the rest of the match
2586340 i saw that the students were more angered when they saw the photos over 150 navajo students signed the petition during their lunch hour
2586341 dont get mad at me im just saying what you cant say
2586342 im gonna bust your head till the white meat shows
2586343 the success of my comedy has been not being afraid to touch on subject matters or issues that everyone else is politically scared of
2586344 its a joke believe me im not trying to hurt anybody
2586345 now america tell me again why cant i whip that girl
2586346 when i saw her laughing i told her that i was going to be a comedian so shed never cry again
2586347 when i started in the clubs i had to work places where didnt nobody else want to work
2586348 i had to do clubs where street gangs were had to do motorcycle gangs gay balls and things of that nature
2586349 the people come to see you the person they fell in love with but when they see you on tv you become a whole other character another person and they become disappointed and i wasnt going to allow that to happen to me
2586350 i found out the cancer returned and that i needed chemo i just fell in a hump on the floor and it was im going to die im going to die and a little angel voice said and
2586351 so funny i thought i would never hear my children ask me that question if they only knew how much i loved them as a preteen
2586352 il fado nato un giorno quando il vento non soffiava e il cielo prolungava lorizzonte del mare e sul ponte di un veliero un marinaio triste cantava

2586369 be happy to participate in one i know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
2586370 i wish that those involved would refrain from bad mouthing my sister
2586371 she is a good and honest person the sweetest and most caring woman one could ever hope to meet
2586372 do you think its easy for us to just sit back and let everyone rip her to shreds and not defend her honor
2586373 it could well be it looks like me i dont know who that baby is i have no idea what the picture is
2586374 i mean do you know how many pictures have been taken of me holding children in the last three years i mean it happens all the time
2586375 i think its amazing even as the mans coming clean that hes continuing to lie
2586376 just as ive been saying for 10 months that he had an affair with rielle hunter we know for a fact that is rielle hunters baby and that is him holding the baby in the beverly hilton hes not only hiding things from the public hes hiding things from his wife
2586377 we couldnt have been there at 3 in the morning if we didnt have a good pipeline into the whole situation
2586378 but oh we had such a great time together during those early months when he was still my romantic hero and i was still his living dream it was excitement and compatibility like id never imagined we invented our own language we went on day trips and road rips we hiked to the top of things swam to the bottom of other things planned the journeys across the world we would take together we had more fun waiting in line together at the department of motor vehicles than most couples have on their honeymoons
2586379 to find the balance you want this is what you must become you must keep your feet grounded so firmly on the earth that its like you have four legs instead of two that way you can stay in the world but you must stop looking at the world through our head you must look through your heart instead that way you will know god
2586380 will you change this or that thing in my life thats difficult for me
2586381 where did you get the idea you arent allowed to petition the universe with prayer you are part of this universe liz youre a constituent you have every entitlement to participate in the actions of the universe and to let your feelings be known so put your opinion out there make your case believe me it will at least be taken into consideration
2586382 still despite all this traveling is the great true love of my life i have always felt ever since i was sixteen years old and first went to russia with my saved up babysitting money that to travel is worth any cost or sacrifice i am loyal and constant in my love for travel as i have not always been loyal and constant in my other loves i feel about travel the way a happy new mother feels about her impossible colicky restless newborn baby i just dont care what it puts me through because i adore it because its mine because it looks exactly like me it can barf all over me if it wants to i dont care
2586383 of course we all inevitably work too hard then we get burned out and have to spend the whole weekend in our pajamas eating cereal straight out of the box and staring at the tv in a mild coma which is the opposite of working yes but not exactly the same thing as pleasure
2586384 when i get lonely these days i think so be lonely liz learn your way around loneliness make a map of it sit with it for once in your life welcome the human experience but never again use another persons body or emotions as a scratching post for your own unfulfilled yearnings
2586385 but i disappear into the person i love i am the permeable membrane if i love you you can have everything you can have my time my devotion my ass my money my family my dog my dogs money my dogs time everything if i love you i will carry for you all your pain i will assume for you all your debts in every definition of the word i will protect you from your own insecurity i will project upon you all sorts of good qualities that you have never actually cultivated in yourself and i will buy christmas presents for your entire family i will give you the sun and the rain and if they are not available i will give you a sun check and a rain check i will give you all this and more until i get so exhausted and depleted that the only way i can recover my energy is by becoming infatuated with someone else
2586386 and the question now for me is what are my choices to be what do i believe that i deserve in this life where can i accept sacrifice and where can i not
2586387 i sit there staring at the computer screen in silence for a long sad time its all for the best i know it is im choosing happiness over suffering i know i am im making space for the unknown future to fill up my life with yet to come surprises i know all this but still

2586406 kami tahu alonso adalah pemain yang bagus dan imbasnya ia dibandrol dengan harga yang bagus pula kami mendapat tawaran namun nilainya tidak cukup jadi kami ia harus bertahan bersama kami
2586407 saya pribadi tidak mempermasalahkan ia bertahan atau tidak ia boleh saja bertahan kami selalu merasa ia adalah pemain yang bagus
2586408 dan bila ia tidak pergi dengan mendatangkan harga yang bagus maka kesimpulannya bakal gampang dan mudah dimengerti ia akan tinggal bersama kami

2586415 a bit of history i joined the acdca in 1973 and was issued membership number 40 denoting that i was the 40th person to join the club since that time i have worked to promote the breed first and our kennel second in 1988 i hosted the acdca national specialty in tulsa ok and in the fall of 1989 the very first akc herding a match for the acdca in december 1990 the club became officially licensed to hold akc herding trials next i hosted the first ever akc herding trials january 5 6th 1990 again for the acdca in 1990 i was also grandfathered in as a herding judge and have judged the acdca national specialty herding trials twice and was voted in to judge again in belton tx 2009 these are just a few of the things i have done for the acdca in the name of education and promotion of the australian cattle dog
2586416 honey you dont need to look like a gangster to be cool
2586417 i regret that you read an attack into my tone
2586418 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
2586419 to compel a man to subsidize with his taxes the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical
2586420 congress should act immediately to allow tax incentives for residential solar and wind systems

2586424 cercheremo di onorare al meglio il posto conquistato in europa
2586425 especially given the recent transformation of consoles from historically teen focused gaming devices to now becoming family entertainment hubs in many living rooms across the globe we are very focused on titles that satisfy this new broad demographic
2586426 we enjoyed working with gameshastra on tumblebugs 2 pc and are excited to collaborate again to bring our games to the emerging realm of console casual gaming the broad consumer appeal and high production values of wildfires titles make them a natural fit for the console space
2586427 after working closely with the wildfire team to create background art for tumblebugs 2 we realized the game was a fantastic wiiware candidate
2586428 the key to a successful wii port is the ability to expand the title to take advantage of the unique wiimote input system and we feel we have came up with a very innovative design that combines the regular shoot to match 3 experience with some very unique wii specific mechanics
2586429 a unit from the seventh airborne assault brigade based in novorossiysk is also on the march
2586430 but the latter are trying to hit georgian positions with artillery fire from java
2586431 the russians have not succeeded in capturing any positions in tskhinvali and therefore they are delivering cunning air strikes upon georgian cities to sow panic among the population and break its resistance spirit

2586437 casa should be issuing qantas with a please explain about the matters which have come to public attention recently
2586438 it is nothing less than their job to inquire into public concerns about qantas
2586439 it is not good enough for the regulator to respond after the event
2586440 one would hope that they had been applying the same level of scrutiny or something approaching it in the lead up to these events
2586441 if nobody cares about what youre doing and nobody on your founding team cares enough to change that then youre probably in trouble
2586442 something that looks vaguely like a bloomberg terminal with charts amp graphs amp tables and a window where you can write code to manage it
2586443 a webapp to ensure compliance with an obscure sec regulation
2586444 a webapp that lets users create their own single player arcade games as long as they stick to prearranged actions amp patterns of movement
2586445 okay lets build applications on our platform and show people that its useful
2586446 well the only thing all our use cases have in common is that they all involve writing code so well provide a way to write code and handle the tricky business of parallel processing ourselves
2586447 well we really need this feature to let people do what they want but it interacts in weird ways with that feature so we need to rethink the whole thing
2586448 oh i need to finish this ui widget and then theres that bug in auto updating the game when properties change and shit its not working
2586449 lets start with that and then expand into other archetypes when we have more experience
2586450 what does this mean we have to include in our platform
2586451 how can we solve the customers problem in the simplest way possible
2586452 it sounds interesting but id need to see a prototype before i invest
2586453 this idea sucks and youll never be able to complete it
2586454 nobody would ever want to have a computer on their desk
2586455 im a smart guy i work really hard when i have a sense of ownership of the project ive got a few years of work experience in fairly related areas why not im just as qualified as anyone else to start a startup
2586456 cool a project thats at the edge of my abilities thisll be an interesting challenge
2586457 no were not going to support that lets just get a basic game done and worry about extending it later
2586458 why cant we make this game do what we want when this other one which is nearly identical can do it
2586459 we have a responsibility to recap whatever we can and not just television either fans can look forward to future recaps of the new york city marathon the 2010 world cup a suite of important wars and an emotional recap of photosynthesis
2586460 we were focused on the products that were going out for grinding
2586461 we were focusing on the product that we tied to the initial illnesses
2586462 we have a billion dollars worth of revenue at stake here so that means were not public television for better or worse
2586463 after you get the reward silly youve your greatest enemy in your palm what to do now use the cash to get away from this town gloat in your higher position
2586464 i have enjoyed our little face offs such as these
2586465 a new genre one could say a new system for making intelligent necessary entertainment for adults
2586466 film based on dr nelsons travels to budapest to defend homeopathy action packed love story
2586467 an exciting informative documentary of desir as a real to life action superhero cartoon character
2586468 its not a spaghetti western its a paprika western the true story of prof nelsons family tree dating back to admiral nelson and robert e lee we see the wagon train ride of prof nelsons ancestors in 1888 from kansas to oregon and back
2586469 a story of a group of explorers who are threatened and or killed by tribesmen in africa a film that teaches us about natural medicine
2586470 traditional scripts are replaced by a more organic flow guided and nurtured by desires brilliant ideas producing some of the finest most spontaneous acting seen on movie screens today
2586471 theyre humans they have all sorts of issues back home and other places like that so im sure it has to do with the stress of being a soldier
2586472 the increase comes as the army continues to bear the brunt of the war demands with many soldiers serving repeated lengthy tours in iraq and afghanistan military leaders including army chief of staff gen george casey have acknowledged that the army has been stretched nearly to the breaking point by the combat
2586473 the army designed the program for high school seniors its brand new promotional materials havent been printed yet but recruiters are talking it up at schools
2586474 the program pays students 1 000 for each month between signing the commitment contract and leaving for basic training after completing high school the army pays an additional 1 000 for high school graduation
2586475 hell rack up 10 000 in bonus money for his nine months in the program including the 1 000 graduation award
2586476 the book is a manual on war there is no rhetoric there are very few adjectives it is a book based on research
2586477 war i believe is an inevitable part of the human condition i doubt it will ever be eradicated but it should never be waged lightly or without good cause the cost is high most of those killed wounded and left homeless in modern warfare are innocents families including children
2586478 will i feel worse if i kill an enemy in an ambush is it easier to bear killing an enemy you cannot see is there a chance i will enjoy killing
2586479 weve come to equate patriotism with militarism if youre patriotic youre assumed to be militaristic if youre militaristic youre assumed to be patriotic now weve measured our patriotism in the last several years against the backdrop of war but the question we have to ask today is who are the patriots here at home
2586480 i believe the educational well being of americans is the key to americas defense
2586481 we will not have great questions decided by irrelevant agencies our husbands shall not come to us reeking with carnage for caresses and applause our sons shall not be taken from us to unlearn all that we have taught them of charity mercy and patience we women of one country will be too tender of those of another to allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs
2586482 voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger
2586483 theres a real gap out there in terms of thinking people think we should buy organic only if we are eating the product
2586484 its ironic that people will pay more money for organic food for their dinner plate because they are afraid of chemicals but then they will buy conventionally grown flowers that are covered in chemicals for the centerpiece of their dinner table and those chemicals will catch up with people maybe not through their mouths but through the water and air
2586485 no provision in the constitution causes one to stumble quite so much on a first reading or second or third reading
2586486 the right of the people to keep and bear arms
2586487 right to keep and bear arm shall not be infringed
2586488 all laws which are repugnant to the constitution are null and void
2586489 like the third amendment against the peacetime quartering of soldiers in private homes the second amendment used to be one of those obscure constitutional provisions that americans could safely ignore
2586490 laws that forbid the carrying of arms disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man
2586491 arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe and preserve order in the world as well as property horrid mischief would ensue were the law abiding deprived the use of them
2586492 the best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed
2586493 the great object is that every man be armed everyone who is able might have a gun
2586494 to preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be taught alike especially when young how to use them
2586495 the constitution shall never be construed to authorize congress to prevent the people of the united states who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms
2586496 arms in the hands of citizens may be used at individual discretion in private self defense
2586497 the people have a right to keep and bear arms
2586498 i ask sir what is the militia it is the whole people except for a few public officials
2586499 a militia when properly formed are in fact the people themselves and include all men capable of bearing arms
2586500 the people are not to be disarmed of their weapons they are left in full possession of them
2586501 no free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms
2586502 as civil rulers not having their duty to the people duly before them may attempt to tyrannize and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear their private arms
2586503 the constitution of most of our states and of the united states assert that all power is inherent in the people that they may exercise it by themselves that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed
2586504 they that can give up liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
2586505 thanks to you i die like jesus christ to inspire generations of the weak and the defenseless people
2586506 i removed 11 bodies last year from my ranch 12 the year before
2586507 dont get me wrong im glad to do this id spend 120 000 if i had to because its the right thing to do
2586508 the corpses of men women and children who perished trying to enter the country are routinely found in brooks county
2586509 about 15 years before the civil war much of the american west was northern mexico the people who lived there werent called latinos or hispanics they were mexican citizens until all that land became part of the united states after that many of them were treated as foreigners in their own land
2586510 the bubbles are gone now we cant blow bubbles anymore
2586511 no nadia i dont want to keep spending my money to buy bubbles again and again just for you to spill them
2586512 well then baba will buy them for me with her money
2586513 der antichrist wird kein amerikaner sein also kann es sich nicht um obama handeln die bibel macht klar dass er von einem obskuren ort wie rum nien stammen wird

2586519 american can be such a force for good in the world
2586520 we do not think that it is right for an act of terrorism which led to the loss of many lives to be commemorated
2586521 blue on white star of david flags fluttered from cars rooftops and balconies fighter planes traced
2586522 war or the threat of it has clouded every day for israelis since david ben gurion declared their state in 1948 that was destined to be a haven for survivors of the nazi holocaust
2586523 announcement by the rabbinical congress of upstate new york february 7 2002
2586524 with pain and sorrow we will gather to protest against the torah defying state of israel specifically against their leader the bloodthirsty sharon
2586525 there shall be no violation of the life body or dignity of any person all persons are entitled to protection
2586526 there shall be no deprivation or restriction of the liberty of a person by imprisonment arrest extradition or otherwise
2586527 the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return
2586528 insofar as israel has violated its conditions for admission to un membership it must accordingly be suspended on a de facto basis from any participation throughout the entire united nations system
2586529 israel will create in the course of the next 10 or 20 years conditions which would attract natural and voluntary migration of the refugees from the gaza strip and the west bank to jordan
2586530 it is the duty of israeli leaders to explain to public opinion clearly and courageously a certain number of facts that are forgotten with time the first of these is that there is no zionism colonization or jewish state without the eviction of the arabs and the expropriation of their lands
2586531 you dont simply bundle people onto trucks and drive them away i prefer to advocate a positive policy to create in effect a condition that in a positive way will induce people to leave
2586532 only a person in whose soul eretz yisrael burns knows the pain of letting go of our ancestral heritage
2586533 i believed and to this day still believe in our peoples eternal and historic right to this entire land
2586534 neither jewish morality nor jewish tradition can be used to disallow terror as a means of war we are very far from any moral hesitations when concerned with the national struggle first and foremost terror is for us a part of the political war appropriate for the circumstances of today
2586535 sienna and he are in love they are living together in la everyone knows about her and accepts her
2586536 she and balthazar met through friends and he was already separated from his wife he should have announced his separation a lot earlier than he did hed been sleeping on friends couches for six months she was always told he was separated
2586537 theres no way she would ever get involved with another married man after jude
2586538 the end of america a letter of warning to a young patriot
2586539 our experiment in democracy could be closed down by a process of erosion
2586540 as difficult as this is to contemplate it is clear if you are willing to look that each of these 10 steps has already been initiated in the united states by the bush administration
2586541 it is not that global islamist terrorism is not a severe danger of course it is what we as american citizens believe is that we are potentially threatened with the end of civilization as we know it
2586542 in my press conference on wednesday i spoke of m sarkozys taste for intimidation and menace
2586543 news flash muslim suicide car bomb today kills 55 in the holy iraq city of karbala
2586544 i need not waste words about what this war means to us our enemies have left no doubt of that we are defending our existence it is good for us to know that it does not make us weak but hard a defeat would destroy us all
2586545 a nation must fight courageously and intelligently for its existence but that is not enough when events intensify and march with giant steps to their culmination racing toward the crisis the main thing is that the leadership and people keep their nerve stubbornly and persistently overcoming dangers and difficulties letting nothing distract them from the continuation of the course that they once saw as correct
2586546 what should i say at the end of this almost concluded stormy year to thank the whole nation for its devotion hard work loyalty and sacrifice for its bravery its contribution of wealth and blood
2586547 naturally the common people dont want war but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag people along voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders this is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and for exposing the country to danger it works the same in every country
2586548 the most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly it must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over
2586549 it is not that global islamist terrorism is not a severe danger of course it is
2586550 im mad as hell and im not gonna take it anymore
2586551 if we understand the mechanisms and motives of the group mind it is now possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without their knowing it
2586552 the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society
2586553 those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country in almost every act of our daily lives whether in the sphere of politics or business in our social conduct or our ethical thinking we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses it is they who pull the wires which control the public mind
2586554 but democrats themselves gave their tribute abundantly witness clinton and his 1996 antiterrorism act which fathered the patriot act his nafta fcc regulations and media consolidation etc
2586555 well id let the police search my car i dont have anything to hide
2586556 tell people you would have been a healthier athlete if you had nice stuff like this

2586646 but it was great of him to come out and do this race and to race with all the people hes a class act out there it was fun we didnt talk a whole lot because it seemed like it was pretty much business
2586647 at the end i realized i was thoroughly cooked but i said i am having a good time
2586648 thats why i wanted to come out here i didnt expect to beat this guy so i just wanted have something out there to shoot for train for stay in shape for and it was a blast it really was
2586649 i wont come back unless im in shape and i feel like im in decent shape you cant show up to this race if youre not in shape so it just depends on how i train id love to be back

2586655 we had seen some strange lights while we were leaving indiana beach on lake shaffer
2586656 none of these objects made any sounds the only sound we heard was when a military jet flew over us and headed towards the objects the objects disappeared and never returned after a short chase by the military jet as we were driving home my sons mom called him to see if we had seen the strange lights in the sky she lives in rochester indiana which is about 40 miles from where we were at she said she was on the lake on her boat and noticed the lights darting around and flaring up
2586657 it happened thursday july 24th 2008 i live in peru indiana my wife and a few people were sitting outside last night around 10 30 pm my wife came in saying they saw a ufo
2586658 i heard a lot of noise that sounded like jet engines they were really low i stopped at a gas station to take a look and seen jets everywhere it was between nine and ten at night and they were chasing this big bright light that glowed red and yellow i guess all this was happening miles away from me in the sky but it looked closer i was at a gas station and everyone was looking at all this when i went inside the cashier said that he thought it was a ufo and everyone in there said the same thing i stopped somewhere between brookston and monticello
2586659 i heard you on coast to coast and wanted to report a bright light i seen near main street and 31 on the 24th 7 24 08 in rochester the light looked like a spotlight they use for store openings and i saw jets around it at 11pm my kid was with me and he got scared i called my wife and asked if she seen it we live near fulton avenue across town and she said the light was high in the sky above our house she didnt see the jets but heard them

2586662 avakian has certainly made very valuable contributions to the field of marxism
2586663 this is not to say that rcp has not done great work nor that they are mainly responsible for the failure for revolutionary politics to take hold just the opposite they have done some remarkable work esp around mumia and in the post 9 11 period
2586664 lack of connection and base among the black masses is not for any lack of trying
2586665 i must take exception to the recurrent assertion that the rcp and avakian have done great things in the past
2586666 avakian has certainly made very valuable contributions to the field of marxism
2586667 this is not to say that rcp has not done great work nor that they are mainly responsible for the failure for revolutionary politics to take hold just the opposite they have done some remarkable work esp around mumia and in the post 9 11 period
2586668 these assertions are simply not accurate avakian has not made a single contribution to the field of marxism and the rcp has not done great work including around mumia and the post 9 11 period
2586669 that rcp critics here are mainly trying to protect themselves from claims of rcp bashing
2586670 the rcp has been a complete and utter failure according to its own stated goals and others too of course this fact which is probably painful for many of you to acknowledge needs to be a premise of any serious discussion of the rcp
2586671 so why has it failed then this is not primarily because of avakian it failed principally for doctrinal reasons that is it is a marxist leninist maoist organization and as such embraces ideas about history and society that have no bearing on the world that we live in
2586672 it would be good if this site promoted critical discussions of these doctrinal issues or minimally direct people to the critical dialogues that have been taking place for the last eighty years or so
2586673 the first time he kissed her he should have been thinking goodbye to my political career
2586674 feel invulnerable that they feel it has gone on all of the time that im not going to be scrutinized at this level and it will stay private
2586675 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2586676 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2586677 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2586678 i dont know what causes one to cross a bright line like this one but its probably going to haunt him for the rest of his life its colossal
2586679 fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make
2586680 i liked him before but i dont see any integrity

2586686 no one cares about us at all lets call it what it is its good all the attention has went the other way cause we really dont like it so you know brett favre going to the jets it can be pretty positive for us all you guys are going to pay attention to them now
2586687 he got a broadway sign and hes on the paper every day so now they have to deal with it i think he is going to realize the media is a little different than in green bay he cant control it
2586688 we have our quarterback here hes not planning on retiring or doing anything silly for the next couple of years so i think we are all right were worrying about the giants
2586689 hes almost the michael jordan of the nfl right now
2586690 he is leaving the one team that he has always known and now he is starting a new chapter in his life i am sure he is excited
2586691 really to be honest with you people dont care about you as a person they just want to know what have you done for me lately with brett favre he has done very well for the packers i just dont think that him leaving the packers was a great thing because you never know with them the jets

2586693 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2586694 had no reason to be more optimistic today than we were yesterday
2586695 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2586696 i dont think there will be any continuation of discussions on the statement the positions are too far apart
2586697 the pullout of georgian troops is the most important thing
2586698 to go as soon as possible to the region to propose to the parties concerned some elements to get out of the crisis
2586699 an immediate cessation of hostilities the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia the re establishment of the situation that existed before
2586700 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2586701 the future world order is to be decided today in georgia
2586702 georgia could have used the years of saakashvilis presidency in different ways to build up the economy to develop the infrastructure to solve social issues both in south ossetia abkhazia and the whole state instead the georgian leadership with president saakashvili undertook consistent steps to increase its military budget from us 30 million to us 1 billion georgia was preparing for a military action
2586703 what we see here is not just a confrontation of minor republics but probably the confrontation between i am sorry to say that moscow and the entire west because now russia is basically protecting its clients and its own citizens up to 80 per cent of south ossetian population have russian passports
2586704 german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier was trying to solve the abkhazian conflict he proposed money to be allocated in the west in order to rebuild the infrastructure of this separatist republic but it didnt work because sides do not accept european mediators any more thats because the eu is politically too weak in the caucasus the eu has no real economic interests in the region and it has no armed forces there it failed in the past 16 years to develop some kind of co operation with russia and georgia or to join the peacekeeping missions in the region
2586705 several russian peacekeepers have been killed and that has greatly increased the stakes in the conflict because a few weeks ago president medvedev personally called mikhail saakashvili and asked him to refrain from using force against russian peacekeepers and the worst has happened the georgians killed russian peacekeepers in south ossetia and it is an attack not only against south ossetia its an attack against russia
2586706 be leader of stability and security on the entire territory of the former ussr
2586707 global ideological confrontation has been replaced by a struggle for spheres of interest in geopolitics
2586708 it is extremely important that all those involved show restraint and play their part in bringing about a political solution
2586709 it is important that the parties in conflict quickly start to communicate so as to put an end to the use of violence
2586710 for the georgian people this is really a sign of strong solidarity with them
2586711 its one thing to know it its another thing to see it
2586712 the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia must be respected
2586713 only the russian media and one ukrainian channel have been filming in the breakaway republic no western camera crews have been working in the conflict zone
2586714 the president of the united states and putin discussed the situation
2586715 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2586716 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2586717 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2586718 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2586719 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2586720 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2586721 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2586722 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2586723 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds
2586724 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
2586725 this is the time americans will be looking back on saying

2586727 rioters drove two vehicles into a station under the border patrol armed police division in the xinjiang city of kashgar
2586728 we are prepared to deal with any kind of security threat and we are confident we will have a safe and peaceful olympic games
2586729 we all feel the chinese authorities have done everything possible to assure the safety and security of everyone attending the games
2586730 these policies are forcing more uighurs to turn to more militant protest
2586731 i am very skeptical of this kind of information that comes only from chinese sources
2586732 the surveillance system deployed by china for the olympics which includes key pieces of western technology is the most comprehensive and sophisticated surveillance system ever
2586733 the legacy of the beijing olympics will be a high tech police state
2586734 the legacy of the beijing olympics will be a high tech police state
2586735 it will be the most intense unpredictable and complicated sports event in the history of the olympic movement we have many scandals in store for us but one should not expect any outstanding achievements from russian athletes the specialist said
2586736 the moons shadow on the sun will trigger political changes and high profile criminal cases in russia
2586737 the eclipse will contribute to the removal of living and dead monsters of old ideology that enslaved peoples minds

2586742 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others accompanying the victim
2586743 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2586744 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2586745 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2586746 we cant neglect the threats from international terrorism forces either
2586747 all levels should sign letters of responsibility with management objectives get clear of their responsibilities one by one study the measures to implement task by task and assign tasks unit by unit individual by individual
2586748 its as if the whole society has been put on duty
2586749 with leaflets distributed everywhere telling us that if we see suspicious people or people coming to beijing to appeal or people passing out leaflets we have to report them
2586750 transport is really inconvenient if you go out maybe youre a little busy and you forget your id that means big trouble theres a sign on our street that says report any foreigners to the police and there are leaflets stipulating all kinds of rules they are scared that city residents will tell foreigners about the real situation here were all put under a lot of pressure
2586751 its as if a national disaster is upon us the authorities response is if you are inconvenienced please understand its just like during the sars period society has been sealed up with restrictions on movement and interaction people who come in from outside have to apply and register
2586752 chinese team flag bearer yao ming stepping into the stadium with heroic youngster
2586753 over the past nine years the ccp has used a variety of inaccurate labels on falun gong in each case the aim has been to vilify people who practice falun gong and therefore justify the horrors these people are subject to under ccp rule
2586754 there exists sadly a real possibility that the ccp would attempt to stage or attribute a disruptive act with the intent to pin it on falun gong
2586755 i witnessed on a daily basis the unremitting vilification of falun gong and falun gong practitioners in all areas of the chinese print and television
2586756 it was the most extreme and unjustified campaign of unmitigated hatred i have ever witnessed
2586757 anyone who participates in an organized act of violence in the name of falun gong is by the very act itself not a falun gong practitioner and certainly does not represent the community of falun gong practitioners
2586758 in all our efforts to regain our basic freedoms over the past nine years we have never engaged in acts that intentionally harm innocent people
2586759 the foundation of our faith is the principles of honesty compassion and tolerance and we aim to follow these in everything we do even when exposing the abuses meted out by the ccp
2586760 today there were again four german reporters coming to film near the state letters and complaints reception office according to the requirement of the central party conference office and state letters and complaints office local interceptors are strictly prohibited from staying near the central and state letter and complaints offices so as to avoid being sighted by overseas reporters relevant personnel will be held accountable for causing negative influence
2586761 the landlord and a group of others raided her house no chairs no stools documents have been removed everything is missing
2586762 that place actually does not deal with any applications at all they try to persuade you not to take this action
2586763 they do not let us take this way but ask us to go through the channel of appeal to resolve our problems they are all cheating us the grassroots people
2586764 some reporters seemed to try to do interviews but were stopped by them the reporters wanted to see if there were people lodging applications and the results but they were barred from entering
2586765 there appeared to be more security personnel than visitors at the park
2586766 designating unilaterally protest zones for demonstrators does not equate to respecting the right to demonstrate because in this situation control comes first and the right second
2586767 we must bid farewell to autocracy whatever shape it takes whatever justification it gives authoritarian government always ends up trampling on equality denying justice and stealing happiness and laughter from the people
2586768 china has endured disasters suffering humiliation and a darkness that made people hopeless
2586769 we do not have an open media even though freedom of expression is more valuable than life itself
2586770 today is not the time to dwell on our problems but neither should we accept those who tell us these games are not political
2586771 they imply that this fortnight of sport is somehow disconnected from history and psychology unrelated to theory and morality and on a more elevated plane than base human nature
2586772 they argue that anyone who links the games with politics has sinister ulterior motives that they are anti chinese
2586773 the bodies were swiftly removed by police who sealed off accident scenes with orange tape and cleared other workers from the area while the dead were loaded into police vehicles

2586805 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2586806 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2586871 w re das spiel zeitgleich mit dem kinofilm gestartet h tte es sich in der zwischenzeit locker vier mio mal verkauft und 100 mio dollar an zus tzlichen ums tzen eingebracht
2586872 es ist in der videospielbranche inzwischen durchaus blich dass videospielumsetzungen fast zeitgleich zu den kinofilmen auf den markt kommen
2586873 videospielumsetzungen sind nat rlich besonders f r fans des films oder der filmreihe anziehend erst durch das spiel k nnen sie ihre lieblingscharaktere und szenen aus dem film interaktiv und virtuell erfahren und zwar so oft sie wollen und jedes mal auf eine neue art und weise

2586877 doch ist die bundeswehr kein musikverein sondern eine armee daher protestieren wir gegen die milit rpropagandashow

2586883 pois assim disse jeov o criador dos c us ele o verdadeiro deus o formador da terra e aquele que a fez aquele que a estabeleceu firmemente que n o a criou simplesmente para nada que
2586884 dize nos quando suceder o estas coisas e qual ser o sinal da tua presen a e da termina o do sistema de coisas

2586886 pois segundo o desejo deles escapa lhes este fato de que desde a antiguidade havia c us e uma terra sobressaindo compactamente gua e no meio da gua pela palavra de deus e por esses meios o mundo daquele tempo sofreu destrui o ao ser inundado pela gua mas pela mesma palavra os c us e a terra que agora existem est o sendo guardados para o fogo e est o sendo reservados para o dia do julgamento e da destrui o dos homens mpios

2586921 terwijl de meeste sportcollegas de komende weken alles op alles zetten om de olympische spelen te verslaan draai ik mezelf intussen warm voor de paralympics
2586922 de keiharde strijd om een prestatie te leveren de inzet de motivatie de jarenlange trainingen voor dat ene moment dat de sporter moet vlammen de druk de spanning de concentratie en dan dus dat allesbepalende moment eigenlijk is het een heel universeel verhaal iets bereiken in je leven de strijd die daarvoor geleverd wordt en wat daarna komt het succes of falen en daar dan weer mee leren leven
2586923 redelijk sportief ik ga twee keer per week naar de sportschool wil drie keer maar dat lukt nooit want tijdgebrek door onregelmatig werken daar doe ik aan fitness gedoe met gewichten en toestellen en wat cardio en als ik dan nog niet totaal uitgeput ben duik ik ook nog even in het zwembad zit in de sportschool wel zo handig daarnaast jog ik zon twee drie keer per week door het park
2586924 dankzij alle endorfine die daarbij vrij komt voel ik me heel happy
2586925 badminton en fietsen badminton is leuk omdat het een ongelofelijk snelle sport is lekker hard tegen een shuttle slaan hard heen en weer rennen en dan weer een subtiele korte slag die de tegenstander in verwarring brengt
2586926 tsja fietsen de mooiste sport die er is het liefst in de bergen omhoog rijden in een tempo dat veel lager is dan dat van de cracks maar jezelf wel inbeelden dat je boogerd zoetemelk of johan van der velde bent en dan bovenop de top kijkend naar al die andere mannen van middelbare leeftijd constateren yes dat is me toch maar mooi gelukt
2586927 voetbal nooit meer de geur van gras nooit meer die sliding nooit meer die verbaasde blikken als je als technisch matige verdediger ineens een paar doelpunten scoort helaas geen bijzondere reden om te stoppen een paar keer verhuisd geen nieuwe club gevonden en zonder het in de gaten te hebben gestopt
2586928 en waar ik naar kijk als ik er goed over nadenk moet ik misschien wel met enige schaamte erkennen dat ik eigenlijk alle sporten wel leuk vind om te zien behalve dan badminton dat is nauwelijks te volgen op tv hockey heb nooit begrepen waarom ik fout ben als iemand anders de bal tegen mijn voet slaat en curling dat gebezem maar voor de rest verslavend
2586929 heb ik drie jaar gevoetbald we waren zo jong dat er niet echt vaste posities waren op het veld behalve n die van de keeper en de laatste twee van de drie jaar was dat mijn plek het was geweldig om als allerlaatste jongetje je team van de ondergang te kunnen redden iedereen was toentertijd ongeveer even lang maar mijn 1 71 m zou een uiteindelijke carri re als keeper natuurlijk niet bevorderen soms speel ik nog wel eens een partijtje in het goffertpark das dus n et het stadion met wat vrienden vooral erg lekker na een lange nachtdienst
2586930 dat heb ik negen jaar intensief en met ontzettend veel plezier gedaan het is jammer dat veel mensen badminton verwarren met campminton zoals s zomers op de camping wordt gespeeld want het doet de sport absoluut geen eer aan het echte badminton is een verschrikkelijk snelle sport waarbij je niet alleen technisch heel scherp moet zijn maar ook binnen zeer korte tijd tactische beslissingen moet nemen daar is op de camping natuurlijk geen sprake van met die lullige houten rackets die eenvoudig je pols zouden kunnen breken en de wind die alles letterlijk in de war stuurt inmiddels ontbreekt de tijd om nog net zo intensief als eerst te spelen maar om de zoveel tijd ben ik toch nog wel te vinden op een badmintonbaan
2586931 verder laat ik me wat voetbal betreft graag bijpraten door mn collegas ik blijf er niet voor thuis waar ik als het even kan w l voor thuisblijf is de formule 1 volgens mij heb ik de afgelopen elf jaar geen race gemist al is het midden in de nacht natuurlijk is niet elke race even interessant maar vaak genoeg en zeker dit seizoen gebeuren er bloedstollende dingen waardoor je op het puntje van je stoel zit met vrienden ga ik zelf vaak karten en hoewel ik geen echt racewonder blijk ben ik eigenlijk altijd wel bij de beste vier te vinden
2586932 wat ik in spanje op sportgebied wist te presteren stelde nooit veel voor met n uitzondering een glorierijke voorstelling waarop ik tijdelijk doorging voor nederlands beroemdste voetballer maar dat verhaal over mn belevenis als cruyffs dubbelganger valt buiten dit kader de details kun je over een paar maanden lezen in mn nieuwe boek barcelona amor meu
2586933 kwam ook doordat ik letterlijk van huis uit een watersporter ben ik zeg letterlijk omdat de achtertuin van ons huis in reeuwijk een glinsterend greppeltje had dat op de plassen uitkwam via dat groene tunneltje want boven mijn hoofd raakten de wiegende toppen van het riet elkaar bereikte ik daar als tiener voor het eerst het paradijs op aarde dus op het water waar de engeltjes verblijven zeilen is zaligheid
2586934 maar die jeugdliefde bleef in spanje buiten mijn bereik eerst omdat de nos en andere bazen me continu bezig hielden ik herinner me een hele zomer in een strandhuisje op 15 kilometer van barcelona waar ik geen enkele keer het zand onder mn voeten kreeg en later omdat ik naar het droge madrid moest verhuizen zon dikke 300 kilometer van de zee af watersport in geen velden of wegen te bekennen
2586935 lukte het me af en toe dit gemis te vergoeden op een vakantie in het buitenland een van mijn meest opwindende ervaringen daarbij was met een lichte catamaran over de golftoppen langs een koraalrif scheren met een stevige tropische bries in het zeil onovertreffelijk
2586936 ging ik ook wel s waterski n vooral vanwege ijdeltuit vrees ik nu daarna lange tijd niet meer maar afgelopen zomer liet ik me als gast bij vrienden op een luxueuze tweemaster in de middellandse zee door een weddenschap verleiden om die jeugdige jolijt nog eens uit te proberen nou dat heb ik geweten maanden later liep ik nog steeds met mn armen half uit de sokkels en al mn rugspieren in n grote pijnlijke knoop rond maar goed pret komt zelden gratis
2586937 kortom zoals aan het begin eerlijk opgebiecht op sportgebied presteer ik niet veel tenzij we onder sport ook het razende enthousiasme meetellen waarmee ik lekker uitgezakt voor de tv met een glas witte wijn in de hand achtereenvolgens de spelers van oranje en van het spaanse elftal bij het ek heb aangemoedigd met mijn hese kreten heel sportief over beiden verdeeld dat zweer ik

2586941 the vogue for drinking chocolate already established in spain reached the british isles thanks to a frenchman who in 1657 opened the first chocolate factory in london unlike in france where it was a pleasure strictly limited to the aristocracy this excellent west indian drink was made available to the middle classes from the outset soon alongside the coffee houses which made their appearance from 1652 there opened the first chocolate houses london was also the setting in 1674 for a historic invention solid chocolate presented in the form of spanish rolls or pastilles and sold by the coffee mill and tobacco roll shop
2586942 roasting cocoa beans shelling them crushing them in a large mixing bowl and transferring them to a heated grinding stone using an iron rolling pin the cocoa beans are ground into a liquid and sugar and spices are added

2586944 its kind of disappointing when you talk it up and talk it up and then nothing happens

2586948 at this time developers cannot access lending at reasonable terms

2586950 that rubble needs to go and lets put some grass there
2586951 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2586952 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2586953 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2586954 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2586955 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2586956 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2586957 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2586958 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2586959 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2586960 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2586961 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

2586963 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2586964 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2586965 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2586966 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2586967 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2586968 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2586969 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2586970 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2586971 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2586972 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2586973 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2586974 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2586975 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2586976 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2586977 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2586978 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2586979 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2586980 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2586981 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2586982 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2586983 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2586984 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2586985 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2586986 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2586987 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2586988 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2586989 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2586990 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2586991 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2586992 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2586993 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2586994 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2586995 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2586996 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2586997 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2586998 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2586999 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2587000 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2587001 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2587002 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2587003 who are open to doing something on the production side
2587004 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2587005 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2587006 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2587007 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2587008 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2587009 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2587010 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2587011 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2587012 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2587013 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2587014 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2587015 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2587016 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2587017 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2587018 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2587019 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2587020 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

2587024 california statutes permit homeschooling as a species of private school education
2587025 i am pleased that the courts have clarified the right of california parents to homeschool their children
2587026 i have respected the right of parents to make educational decisions they feel are in the best interest of their children as head of californias public school system it would be my wish that all children attend public school but i understand that a traditional public school environment may not be the right setting for each and every child i would point out that within californias education system there are many options available from independent study to charter schools to non classroom based programs
2587027 it is my hope that todays ruling will allay many of those fears and resolve much of the confusion
2587028 i also appreciate the caution and concern taken by the court to protect children when their safety becomes an issue
2587029 i pulled my first son out of first grade to homeschool him because i thought it would be better for him than the school system
2587030 i was not satisfied by how business was being conducted at his private school and my younger son never went to school
2587031 it leaves homeschooling exactly where it belongs that is legal in the state of california without any kind of restraint or interference form the government i am a little disappointed the ruling said there should be some kind of legislation to define homeschooling in doing that regulations and restrictions might impede parents from teaching kids in the best possible way
2587032 my youngest son is 16 now and is going to join community college
2587033 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2587034 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2587035 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2587036 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2587037 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2587038 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2587039 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2587040 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2587041 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2587042 just so you all know we did set a record
2587043 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2587044 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2587045 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2587046 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2587047 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2587048 closing down or removing the centre from ukzn does not appear to be an option as it was rejected by all interviewees and panel members through its international recognition and standing the centre has put ukzn on a world map in social science a position the university dare not risk to lose
2587049 we prostrate ourselves at loves portals anxious for entry like social strivers waiting at the ropeline outside some exclusive club hoping to gain admission to its plushy chambers thereby confirming our essential worth and making us interesting to ourselves
2587050 you never know for sure how girls minds work do you really think its a mind in there or just a little buzz like a bee in a glass jar
2587051 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
2587052 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2587053 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
2587054 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2587055 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2587056 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2587057 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2587058 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2587059 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2587060 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2587061 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2587062 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2587063 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2587064 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2587065 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2587066 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2587067 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2587068 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2587069 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2587070 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2587071 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2587072 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2587073 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2587074 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2587075 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2587076 this is also the reason why i cannot read the newspaper wit
2587077 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2587078 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2587079 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2587080 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2587081 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2587082 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2587083 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2587084 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2587085 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2587086 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2587087 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2587088 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2587089 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2587090 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
2587091 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2587092 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2587093 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2587094 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2587095 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2587096 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2587097 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2587098 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2587099 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2587100 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2587101 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2587102 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2587103 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2587104 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2587105 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2587106 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2587107 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2587108 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2587109 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2587110 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2587111 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2587112 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2587113 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2587114 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2587115 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2587116 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2587117 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2587118 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2587119 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2587120 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2587121 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2587122 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2587123 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2587124 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2587125 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2587126 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2587127 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2587128 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2587129 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2587130 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2587131 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2587132 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2587133 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2587134 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2587135 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2587136 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2587137 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2587138 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2587139 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2587140 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2587141 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2587142 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2587143 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2587144 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2587145 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2587146 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2587147 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2587148 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2587149 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2587150 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2587151 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2587152 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2587153 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2587154 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2587155 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2587156 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2587157 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2587158 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2587159 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2587160 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2587161 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2587162 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2587163 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2587164 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2587165 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2587166 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2587167 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2587168 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2587169 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2587170 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
2587171 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2587172 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2587173 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2587174 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2587175 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2587176 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2587177 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2587178 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
2587179 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
2587180 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
2587181 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2587182 marks injury is not as bad as a lot of people feared it was so well take the reps until he gets back and well see what happens then
2587183 im happy for mark that the injury is not as serious as it could have been
2587184 but my thinking hasnt changed at all im still going to compete for first team reps
2587185 its the same kind of opportunity just shortened a little i guess
2587186 let your mercy o lord be upon us just as we hope in you
2587187 our vision is clearly stated when comes to internet marketing service we aim to produce state of the art service
2587188 to me it is important to know and truly understand every word in all the articles i have written words are powerful
2587189 our service is customer oriented we let customers to provide us with keywords and we will write well researched high quality piece customers can also request for custom quote for draft article
2587190 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2587191 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2587192 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2587193 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2587194 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2587195 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2587196 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2587197 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2587198 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2587199 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2587200 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2587201 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2587202 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2587203 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2587204 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2587205 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2587206 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2587207 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2587208 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2587209 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2587210 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2587211 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2587212 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2587213 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2587214 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2587215 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2587216 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2587217 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2587218 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2587219 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2587220 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2587221 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2587222 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2587223 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2587224 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2587225 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2587226 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2587227 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2587228 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2587229 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
2587230 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling
2587231 environmentalist did not make gas go to over 4 gallon
2587232 i dont want to have to change my life even it it benefits society as a whole
2587233 humans are an infinitessimally small part of the global eco system
2587234 its the downturn that has made greenery look unappetising but it may yet prove to do more than anything to save the planet
2587235 it runs on biodiesel and im gonna put solar on it someday
2587236 recently mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2587237 mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2587238 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
2587239 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2587240 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2587241 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
2587242 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
2587243 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
2587244 i spoke to my sister elsje today she started her radiation treatment for cancer last monday and is doing well
2587245 her strength and courage has also been an inspiration to me and it is even more true today
2587246 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2587247 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2587248 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2587249 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2587250 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2587251 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2587252 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2587253 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2587254 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2587255 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2587256 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2587257 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2587258 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2587259 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2587260 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2587261 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2587262 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2587263 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2587264 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2587265 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2587266 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2587267 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2587268 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2587269 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2587270 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2587271 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2587272 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2587273 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2587274 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2587275 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2587276 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2587277 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2587278 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2587279 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2587280 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2587281 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2587282 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2587283 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2587284 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2587285 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2587286 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2587287 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2587288 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2587289 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2587290 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2587291 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2587292 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2587293 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2587294 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2587295 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2587296 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2587297 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2587298 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2587299 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2587300 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2587301 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2587302 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2587303 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
2587304 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
2587305 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
2587306 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2587307 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2587308 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
2587309 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2587310 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2587311 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2587312 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2587313 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2587314 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2587315 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2587316 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2587317 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2587318 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2587319 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2587320 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2587321 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2587322 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2587323 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2587324 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2587325 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2587326 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2587327 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2587328 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2587329 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2587330 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2587331 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2587332 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2587333 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2587334 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
2587335 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
2587336 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
2587337 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
2587338 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2587339 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century
2587340 among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of israel of the freedom party herut a political party closely akin in its organization method political philosophy and social appeal to the nazi and fascist parties
2587341 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner
2587342 but go ahead ed subscribe to the neville chamberlen nelson mandela jimmy carter theory of appeasement
2587343 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
2587344 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
2587345 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
2587346 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2587347 you conviently forget israel won the land when they were attacked in 48 67
2587348 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
2587349 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal if the arabs are in this small country there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries all of them not one village not one tribe should be left
2587350 the police of the world as well as judge jury and executioner
2587351 i think a two by four will work just fine i just need to apply it a little less sparingly
2587352 question on my part as in israel and palistine i am ill informed is the current thinking in israel the same as in 1895 and 1940 respectfully
2587353 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying
2587354 an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party
2587355 how about compensation for jews kicked out all over the world
2587356 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2587357 for mainstream american blacks the vast majority of churches have hebrew names
2587358 infered black muslim bho fit with this jew hatred or kinda love maybe here
2587359 the majority of black americans are unaware of the complexity of the meaning of israel to american jews but ironically afro zionists have as an intense an emotional identification with africa and with the third world as american jews have with israel doubly ironic this same intensity of identification with a motherland seems rooted in the mythologies common to both groups in this special sense in the spiritual sense implied by zion and diaspora and promised land maybe black americans are americas jews but given the isolation of black americans from any meaningful association with africa extensions of the mythology would be futile we have no distant homeland preparing an ingathering
2587360 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the
2587361 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to
2587362 since june the uk top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum it turns out that chris browns
2587363 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
2587364 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
2587365 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
2587366 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
2587367 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
2587368 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
2587369 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
2587370 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
2587371 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
2587372 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
2587373 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
2587374 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
2587375 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
2587376 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
2587377 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
2587378 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
2587379 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
2587380 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
2587381 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
2587382 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2587383 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
2587384 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2587385 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up
2587386 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2587387 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2587388 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2587389 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2587390 i think global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2587391 but i think that global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2587392 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2587393 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2587394 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2587395 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2587396 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2587397 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2587398 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2587399 during an economic downturn women are less inclined to let it all hang out and more likely to cover up
2587400 the mail said similar changes in beach fashion occurred in 1929 during the great depression and after world war ii such negative events appeared to influence beach goers to wear more clothing during their leisurely beach activities the newspaper said
2587401 brandon was a little slower today just some complications with it its no different than what weve said with all of the guys you try to monitor what they do youre very cautious with them move them along at the right pace the right pace for one guy is a different pace than somebody else
2587402 they did very well theyre starting to get into the rhythm of camp yesterday they picked it up today had wonderful energy some enthusiasm there
2587403 i believe a great deal you could start with his basic story its a pretty good one its a pretty good testament to a young man fighting through a lot of adverse situations and finding a way to be successful this last one hes just continued that personality if youre around him you have to gain some strength from just his presence and knowing the story
2587404 is been good its difficult for me because i dont expect it to be anything but that what is doing is what weve seen from him before his spring two years ago he showed some wonderful things in there showed some leadership some enthusiasm this year its the same way this is nothing new nothing unexpected
2587405 there are so many things going on one of the things is when you have younger players what environment allows them to best respond and best see what their talents are sometimes its matching the young guy with an older guy that kind of elevates them and sometimes youve got some competition with certain guys so why not make those kinds of switches and those kinds of adjustments theres a lot of things that go into it it may be almost more individual with each player than just a total package from one group to the other different combinations different levels of communication who communicates well with this guy with that guy you try those combinations there will be a multitude of things that well be doing that wont just be one particular reason for making a switch adjustment or change it can have nothing to do with changes in the depth chart just things we need to do we need to see as coaches to build our football team
2587406 they have their up moments and their down moments theyre doing some things well for the younger guys theres still a lot of learning taking place but overall ive been pleased ive been pleased with all of them theres not a disappointment there in the group
2587407 i dont think the fact that weve added equipment has changed their approach the major change for them is simply the information overload thats where theyll struggle i think this is a very confident group of young men that are confident in their abilities to perform its just a simple matter of them learning what to do and thats where they struggle at usually as the offense is adding information so is the defense so that makes their adjustments their changes greater and that complicates things but they seem to be doing well

2587449 sorry dynamic pages in the img tags are not allowed
2587450 i was very disappointed in houston because we were ready to help
2587451 it wasnt until two weeks later that the attorneys got a notice the bond fund was available we only had one person who was still being detained and whose family couldnt raise the bail money
2587452 within 24 hours ice decided to take them to the detention centers in texas just to facilitate removing them as fast as possible i thought that was unfair
2587453 if they stayed in massachusetts close to where we could have bonded them out they could have gotten due process
2587454 one of his big themes was that the immigration story in the united states is vital to the health and growth of our country
2587455 i know many many many latin americans including many many mexicans so i have a personal friendship a personal affinity
2587456 these contributors better be prepared to lose a lot of money
2587457 theres one more reason besides humanitarian that this bond fund was created and its just as important its political
2587458 we hope that if we get a lot of history helping people in raids plus a lot of contributions even if its only a buck then we can really have a voice next year in the immigration debate
2587459 we were able to find a family a pro bono lawyer and convince a judge to let us post a 4 000 bond to get him out of jail and into a permanent situation
2587460 when the 4 000 comes back were going to offer that as a scholarship fund for him

2587463 well im happy to get the first race jitters out
2587464 the first race is probably the most important one getting it out of your system and im pretty satisfied with the time i didnt think i could i could be that fast in the prelims
2587465 qualifying first was something i really wanted to do after watching those first three heats i wanted to be in the middle of the pool tomorrow and hopefully thatll give me some advantage in seeing everybody
2587466 i think itll take faster than what we all went tonight but well see what happens
2587467 i feel like i have a better swim in me too
2587468 i just wanted to come in here and do something to help the team
2587469 you know what ive had a great year and i cant let one bad meet get me down i know where im at now i know where im supposed to be and i just need to look forward
2587470 these are not naughty postcards from the beach they are undoubtedly porn pure and simple some of it is quite dark with animals committing fellatio and girl on girl action its quite unpleasant
2587471 ive never had an experience like this with this campaign or others i thought they crossed the line if you have a problem with a story i write call me first im a big boy i can handle it but they never called they attacked me like im a political opponent
2587472 my piece yesterday was totally wrongheaded and awful i take it all back
2587473 what brooks is arguing for is for rockefeller republicanism the idea that you are ok with the new deal but you want a mean and flinty old man from new england to guard the money to pay for the largesse but the republicans just spend the last 40 years hunting that lot to extinction starting with goldwater in 64 but there is really no way to advocate rockefeller republicanism without admitting that mistakes have been made just as there is no way the republicans can be the party of civil rights without admitting that mistakes have been made admitting you have a problem is obviously not enough but it is a necessary first step
2587474 he doesnt ever want to be something that he is not

2587489 breast feeding is associated with resilience against the psychosocial stress linked with parental divorce separation
2587490 theres a lot less verbal communication but lots of tactile communication and eye contact that promotes positive physiological responses
2587491 breast feeding does seem to suppress stress responses in babies and it does seem that theres a protective effect
2587492 in terms of the biological possibility breast milk is pretty amazing stuff and the tactile interaction that goes along with breast feeding does have an influence on the development of neurons
2587493 for most mothers breast feeding doesnt come naturally if the baby doesnt latch on it can lead to feelings of failure and concern about whether or not the baby is getting enough milk women need lots of encouragement and education
2587494 breast feeding is something for mothers and babies to enjoy a time for them to cherish and nurture each other
2587495 i woke up and started crying when i realized it was just a dream
2587496 i swear to god she said the exact same thing
2587497 they woke me up really early and put me on speakerphone and diane said hey guess what kiddo you made the team i had to make sure i was awake
2587498 i had to take deep breaths all the time and my dreams were terrible
2587499 i had nothing but anxiety about it and couldnt force a positive thought
2587500 i was desperate for someone to say something to help me go to sleep at night and jayne was the only person i could think of that could really help me
2587501 she was always such a good role model for me she was the person i wanted to be i finally got ahold of her and had one of those amazing conversations that completely relaxed me
2587502 jen sounded like she was doubting herself and there was no reason for her to do that
2587503 all i had to do was remind her how special she is not just as a volleyball player but as a person
2587504 every time we switch joines on the court she always brings a positive energy to the team
2587505 the first week of the grand prix when we were struggling with sea level and jetlag we put her on the court and we changed the game
2587506 its been a very long climb from junior volleyball to high school to university of the pacific which was fabulous for jennifer

2587545 especially given the recent transformation of consoles from historically teen focused gaming devices to now becoming family entertainment hubs in many living rooms across the globe we are very focused on titles that satisfy this new broad demographic
2587546 we enjoyed working with gameshastra on tumblebugs 2 pc and are excited to collaborate again to bring our games to the emerging realm of console casual gaming the broad consumer appeal and high production values of wildfires titles make them a natural fit for the console space
2587547 after working closely with the wildfire team to create background art for tumblebugs 2 we realized the game was a fantastic wiiware candidate
2587548 the key to a successful wii port is the ability to expand the title to take advantage of the unique wiimote input system and we feel we have came up with a very innovative design that combines the regular shoot to match 3 experience with some very unique wii specific mechanics

2587618 who work however adroitly or maladroitly with words and ideas
2587619 tend s to have values antagonistic to a traditional bourgeois society it is not too much to say that these people see the constitution as a weapon in a class struggle about social and political values
2587620 since the politicization of law has for half a century moved results steadily to the left a very large number of americans do not like those outcomes
2587621 o ne purpose of this book is to persuade americans that no person should be nominated or confirmed who does not display both a grasp of and devotion to the philosophy of original understanding

2587626 when a southerner calls himself a conservative he is usually thinking of a way of life of a social and moral order for which the people of the 1860s went to war
2587627 mr bork is a thoughtful legal scholar and must surely recognise the problems in his ideas he himself used to criticise originalism before it became flavour of the month at the justice department yet consider the alternatives open to him he can acknowledge that his theory of constitutional interpretation is both incoherent and unworkable and thus retrospectively legitimate the painful criticism to which he was subject during the hearings alternatively he can turn his back on scholarship and real history becoming instead a revered video pundit of the right complete with scars got in honourable battle and a theory that can be explained between commercial breaks who can be surprised when he chooses the latter course who can be surprised to find that his theory fails to confront the objections raised to it who can be surprised that his book consists instead of a process of denial denial of philosophical problems historical problems logical problems and finally denial of personal inconsistency

2587629 t hese are stories that may be left for another time
2587630 t he warren court challenges us to think again whether there is or can be any substance to the distinction between law and politics
2587631 give the constitution its true meaning the possibility implied by those comforting phrases does not exist
2587632 the law he said is like a single bed blanket on a double bed and three folks in the bed and a cold night there aint ever enough blanket to cover the case no matter how much pulling and hauling the question then is not whether courts should make law but how and from what materials
2587633 s ometimes they dictate results but more often these sources suggest that the court must enter a field and yet do not answer the important questions found there
2587634 history can be of considerable help but it tells us much too little about the specific intentions of the men who framed adopted and ratified the great clauses the record is incomplete the men involved often had vague or even conflicting intentions and no one foresaw or could have foreseen the disputes that changing social conditions and outlooks would bring before the court
2587635 dead right about the inadequacy of the traditional sources of law
2587636 working in the method familiar to lawyers trained in the common law the judge can construct principles that explain existing constitutional rights and extrapolate from them to define new natural rights
2587637 in proceeding to derive new rights the courts must be controlled by the methods and disciplines that lawyers call craftsmanship only in this way so far as i can see can we begin to meet the plea made by professor herbert wechsler of columbia for neutral principles of constitutional law
2587638 all regulations all taxes and all modifications of liability rules are takings of private property prima facie compensable by the state
2587639 a salutary demonstration of the courts ability to protect fundamental human values
2587640 at the time i thought quite erroneously that new basic rights could be derived logically by finding and extrapolating a more general principle of individual autonomy underlying the particular guarantees of the bill of rights
2587641 the possibility implied by these comforting phrases does not exist
2587642 history shows us that the equal protection clause ratified a few years after the civil war grew out of a concern about racial equality but in crucial respects the record leaves us unsure what was meant by equality and how far beyond race the guarantee was intended to reach
2587643 o ne thing the court does know the fourteenth amendment was intended to enforce a core ideal of black equality against governmental discrimination
2587644 the role of a judge committed to the philosophy of original understanding is not to choose a level of abstraction rather it is to find the meaning of a text a process which includes finding its degree of generality which is part of its meaning
2587645 social treatment of homosexuals is based upon moral concerns and it would be difficult to say that the various moral balances struck are unreasonable
2587646 unless we can distinguish forms of gratification the only course for a principled court is to let the majority have its way in both cases there is no principled way to decide that one mans gratifications are more deserving of respect than anothers or that one form of gratification is more worthy than another
2587647 the impossibility is related to that of making interpersonal comparisons of utilities
2587648 ultimately incompatible with the preservation of a liberal capitalist social order
2587649 its basic premises are mutually incompatible and because some of them are incorrect the law has been producing increasingly bizarre results the law must either undergo a difficult process of reform based upon a correct understanding of fundamental legal and economic concepts or resume its descent to the status of an internal tariff against domestic competition and free trade
2587650 what is true is that our ideas are old they carry whatever credentials time alone can confer the years 1890 to 1914 witnessed the origin of every major theory that drives and directs the evolution of antitrust to this day
2587651 the concept of legislative intent may be artificial but it is also indispensable besides the construct is not wholly arbitrary
2587652 a legislature may never address the issue of ultimate policy goals and yet write a law whose various categories and distinctions can be explained only by a particular policy
2587653 have only one legitimate goal and that goal can be derived as rigorously as any theorem in economics
2587654 analyses that while faithful to one generations economic vision could be found not only faulty but practically unintelligible by a later generation of antitrust analysts influenced by a very different vision of the nature of economic reality
2587655 there is no way of deciding these matters other than by reference to some system of moral or ethical values that has no objective or intrinsic validity of its own and about which men can and do differ
2587656 by reference to some system of moral or ethical values that has no objective or intrisic validity of its own
2587657 the layman is likely to think that economic theory is what any economist theorizes but of course it is not if it were we should have to believe that there are dozens or hundreds of mutually incompatible versions of economic theory each as good as any other
2587658 can be derived as rigorously as any theorem in economics
2587659 the judge legislator or lawyer cannot simply take the word of an economist in dealing with antitrust for the economists will certainly disagree
2587660 t his nation has grown up in ways that do not comport with the intentions of the people who wrote the constitution the commerce clause is one example and it is simply too late to go back and tear that up i cite to you the legal tender cases these are extreme examples admittedly scholarship suggests that the framers intended to prohibit paper money any judge who thought today he would go back to the original intent really ought to be accompanied by a guardian rather than be sitting on a bench
2587661 any methodology becomes permissible except of course the traditional one and any reading of the texts becomes legitimate except of course that of the author
2587662 original intent is the only legitimate basis for constitutional decision making
2587663 but why should we be ruled by men long dead
2587664 q uite often when i speak at a law school on the necessity of adhering to the
2587665 but why should we be ruled by men who are long dead
2587666 written of the understanding of the ratifiers of the constitution
2587667 i wish to demonstrate that original intent is the only legitimate basis for constitutional decision making
2587668 a shorthand formulation because what the ratifiers understood themselves to be enacting must be taken to be what the public of that time would have understood the words to mean
2587669 dictionary of the eighteenth century word usages and political and legal ideas which are needed for a true understanding of the constitution
2587670 s peaking only of the constitutional legitimacy of the decision and not of its morality this case remained unchallenged as the worst in our history until the twentieth century provided rivals for that title
2587671 concept that has been used countless times since by judges who want to write their personal beliefs into a document that most inconveniently does not contain those beliefs
2587672 the conduct of the distinguished men who framed the declaration of independence
2587673 instead of the sympathy of mankind to which they so confidently appealed they would have deserved and received universal rebuke and reprobation
2587674 i t does no good to dress the issue up as one of moral philosophy because such philosophy does not give a clear answer arguments have been made both ways and none is conclusive
2587675 i f the greatest minds in our culture have not succeeded in devising a moral system to which all intellectually honest persons must subscribe it seems doubtful to say the least that some law professor will make the breakthrough any time soon
2587676 there comes a time to stop visiting inventors garages to see if someone really has created a perpetual motion machine
2587677 t here seems to be no rational way of securing moral agreement in our culture
2587678 the general language of the clause however continues to subject such cases to the test of whether statutory distinctions are reasonable sexual differences obviously make some distinctions reasonable while others have no apparent basis
2587679 societys treatment of sexual orientation is based upon moral perceptions so that it would be difficult to say that the various moral balances struck are unreasonable
2587680 t he suit was surely brought to seek a declaration that would equate the constitutionality and hence the presumed morality of homosexual and heterosexual conduct hardwicks suit in a word rested upon nothing in the constitution and so was one more sortie in our cultural war
2587681 by calling in the aid of natures unerring and powerful instincts to fortify the fallible and feeble contrivances of our reason we have derived several other and those no small benefits from considering our liberties in the light of an inheritance
2587682 b y what they call reasoning without prejudice leave not one stone upon another in the fabric of human society they subvert all the authority which they hold as well as all that which they have destroyed
2587683 a spirit of innovation is generally the result of a selfish temper and confined views people will not look forward to posterity who never looked back to their ancestors
2587684 all your sophisters cannot produce any thing better adapted to preserve a rational and manly freedom than the course we have pursued who have chosen our nature rather than our speculations our breasts rather than our inventions for the great conservatories and magazines of our rights and privileges
2587685 the assumptions and ideas of the intellectual class regularly mutate which means to the extent that constitutional law incorporates these assumptions our fundamental law will shift with fashion
2587686 w hat makes a society is a community of ideas not political ideas alone but also ideas about the way its members should govern their lives
2587687 a change in moral environment in social attitudes towards sex marriage duties towards children and the like may surely be felt to be as harmful as the possibility of physical violence or the absence of proportional representation of ethnic groups in the workforce
2587688 on the one hand there appears to be a degree of morality so severe it amounts to moralism and on the other a hostility to morality so strong it amounts to moral relativism
2587689 we hear these new teachers continually boasting of their spirit of toleration that those persons should tolerate all opinions who think none to be of estimation is a matter of small merit equal neglect is not impartial kindness
2587690 let them but dissent it is no matter from whom or from what
2587691 that monstrous fiction which by inspiring false ideas and vain expectations into men destined to travel in the obscure walk of laborious life serves only to aggravate and imbitter that real inequality which it never can remove and which the order of civil life establishes as much for the benefit of those whom it must leave in an humble state as those whom it is able to exalt to a condition more splendid but not more happy
2587692 egalitarianism is hostile to hierarchies and distinctions hence law must be used to weaken or eliminate them striking at private morality and behavior that is not egalitarian for entirely innocent reasons the preferences and talents of people will not always produce equality of results the egalitarian tendency is then to coerce equality of result by law
2587693 must legislate moral values if it is not to dissolve social bonds
2587694 a salutary demonstration of the courts ability to protect fundamental human values
2587695 a change in moral environment in social attitudes towards sex marriage duties towards children and the like may surely be felt to be as harmful as the possibility of physical violence or the absence of proportional representation of ethnic groups in the workforce
2587696 a standard of virtue and wisdom beyond the vulgar practice of the hour
2587697 words are wise mens counters but they are the money of fools
2587698 i do not see how i can avoid the conclusions stated
2587699 it is the fact that history does not reveal detailed choices that permits indeed requires resort to other methods of interpretation
2587700 may well have been moved by an nra style philosophy
2587701 i wish to demonstrate that original intent is the only legitimate basis for constitutional decision making
2587702 the only way that the constitution can constrain judges is if the judges interpret the documents words according to the intentions of those who drafted proposed and ratified its provisions and various amendments
2587703 if congress enacted a statute outlawing the sale of automatic rifles and did so in the senate by a vote of 51 to 49 no court would overturn a conviction because two senators in the majority testified that they had really intended only to prohibit the
2587704 the search for the intent of the lawmaker is the everyday procedure of lawyers and judges when they must apply a statute a contract a will or the opinion of a court
2587705 in a constitutional democracy the moral content of the law must be given by the morality of the framer or legislator never by the morality of the judge the sole task of the latter and it is a task quite large enough for anyones wisdom skill and virtue is to translate the framers or the legislators morality into a rule to govern unforeseen circumstances
2587706 forced to conclude that original understanding must give way in the face of transformative or longstanding precedent a conclusion that in turn may make inevitable the unsettling acknowledgement that originalism and stare decisis themsleves are but two among several means of maintaining political stability and continuity in society
2587707 borks notion of framers original intent smells like big frameup
2587708 judge bork is a well known intentionalist a scholar who believes that it is appropriate and desirable for modern constitutional interpreters to try to understand the aims of those who framed the 1787 document and to implement the framers intent
2587709 original understanding of those who agitated for proposed argued over and ultimately voted for or against the constitution of 1787
2587710 we are loath to dangle before the reader yet another promise that the crooked will be made straight and the rough places plain we promise rather complexity and complication
2587711 the role of a judge committed to the philosophy of original understanding is not to
2587712 the characteristic predicament of the modern lawyer is to argue constantly about policy as if rational choice among competing values were possible yet to remain faithful to the idea that values are subjective and to the political doctrine of which that idea is a part
2587713 intellectual presumption or self confidence is the morale of the revolutionary whereby he is enabled to call established order into question in society in the state in the church in the family this is the way in which ability makes its inroads into property in using his magnificent intelligence to deprecate the claims of intelligence burke as usual is discharging a double function he serves the interests of the property owners thus earning their gratitude and at the same time he rehabilitates religion and notably though discreetly and by indirection that form of religion which had most been exposed to the remorseless onslaughts of reason

2587738 we actually started our series work to anticipate this change here in 2002 weve been investing to get ready for this real fundamental shift for quite a while the os will have to change to deal with the heterogeneous many core world where you are today is just a transition point from single core machines to ill say at a steady state point where youre going to have a lot of processors on a chip but they wont all look the same
2587739 the many core world today is one where its still a homogeneous symmetric multiprocessor architecture frankly the operating system vista does a great job on those multiprocessor machines and in fact its the same technology that runs the 128 processor data center servers the problem is the applications in the data center we know how to take workloads and smear them out across those things and you get good efficiency but all the worlds programmers were given a set of tools and a set of techniques for the last 30 or 40 years where when they wrote an application they squashed out all the parallelism that was intrinsic in it and its that serial manifestation that limits our ability to use those additional cores

2587750 bernie mac just say what you want to say but cant
2587751 youre still going have to do the dishes and the laundry and all that
2587752 you were on air force one and you couldnt stop to pick up the kids
2587753 and where the hell did all those chickens come from
2587754 nobody knows they just started showing up about a month ago all over town
2587755 well with a name like roosterville youd expect to find chickens all over the place i suppose wouldnt you
2587756 roosterville was founded in 1887 by matthew harris a chicken farmer he planned the town to be an agrarian commune a haven for the artistic and spiritually enlightened who also wanted to raise chickens
2587757 oh harris was a man well ahead of his time he knew that chicken would one day become a favorite food of americans but back then well no one agreed with him
2587758 so what happened obviously it didnt work out as an agrarian commune
2587759 then it became just another tiny town in patwin county so small we dont even have our own police force which is why you guys are here from san augustin
2587760 so all youve got left is your chicken farms right
2587761 well now theres the thing there arent any chicken farms left around here
2587762 youre welcome hope you can figure out whats going on around here we got a nice town hate to see something like this ruin it
2587763 this is without a doubt the weirdest case ive ever worked three people dead from apparent chicken attacks these things just dont happen
2587764 attacks like these arent random theres something linking all three of the victims im sure of it
2587765 each of them moved into roosterville between six and eight months ago
2587766 i dont know why would anyone have a grudge against people moving into town
2587767 dont you think these could just be random chicken attacks fred i say we just close the case and move on these things happen
2587768 not quite yet theres someone i want to run these images past someone i know at san augustin state he should be able to give us some insight come on
2587769 chickens were probably first domesticated in ancient greece but the red jungle fowl from which modern chickens were bred were probably around for millions of years before that
2587770 and that is chickens in a nutshell naturally theres plenty more i offer a three semester series in the domestication of chickens and youre welcome to sign up the university allows non students to audit any courses at all do you have any questions
2587771 are there any cases in history where chickens attacked and killed a human being
2587772 no of course not chickens will occasionally attack other animals that intrude on their territory but the idea of a fatal attack on humans is ludicrous
2587773 if i showed you a picture of a chicken peck mark could you tell the species
2587774 well the beak shape is highly reminiscent of the black orpington a very popular breed in the united kingdom usually a very docile breed even by chicken standards but look here
2587775 yes but do you see these serrations along the edges
2587776 a chicken with teeth even i know chickens dont have teeth
2587777 well there was an experiment done in 2006 in england some biologists managed to turn on the talpid2 gene in chicken embryos this caused the embryos to grow vestigial teeth much like the prehistoric ancestors of modern chickens
2587778 oh so there could be a breed of chicken with teeth

2588073 the pullout of georgian troops is the most important thing
2588074 to go as soon as possible to the region to propose to the parties concerned some elements to get out of the crisis

2588088 i dont care if we are 40 games behind we should have played better than this
2588089 for me every game is important for me if we are where we are right now we should take it one game at a time and play one day at a time thinking weve got to win this game and when the day is over weve got to win the next one
2588090 maybe half of the team wants to do the best they can take the starting rotation every time we cross that line we want to do our best no matter how many games we are behind but maybe half of the team doesnt have that mentality they are only thinking of finishing strong and to put up their numbers thats great but that affects us as a team that doesnt work out

2588093 i recall paddling a canoe down madison past the water works plant which had been sandbagged to the first floor windows to keep the flood waters out a mark on the west door shows the height of the 1918 flood
2588094 although the flood of 93 was bad the water level was still almost four feet below the flood of 1918 as marked on the west side of the old city water plant
2588095 indians still in the area in 1851 indicated they knew of one other flood which their mark west of the old capitol showed was one foot higher than the 1851 flood the year of the indian flood is not known

2588127 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2588128 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2588129 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2588130 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2588131 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2588132 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2588133 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2588134 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2588135 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry in the russian arsenal they have launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2588136 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2588137 if the russian side is simply convinced it wants to keep pressing the attack militarily there is not much the georgians can do theyre being hit very hard so we have to rely on diplomacy
2588138 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings

2588151 at the child and family policy center we have been doing work on health care and the uninsured for years i am also doing work on education and training for the unemployed and underemployed so naturally these two issues were already together in my mind when i saw the cartoon for the contest
2588152 it is no surprise that more and more people are thinking about health care as its becoming increasingly unaffordable and too many working families are uninsured health care reform has become the top domestic policy priority in the nation which makes it likely that it will be addressed in a meaningful manner soon it is wonderful that clasp is helping to promote this needed agenda with thoughtful humor

2588156 when im president of the united states poverty will be back on the national agenda
2588157 these experiences taught me firsthand that poverty affects not only the 37 million americans who live it but also anyone invested in the purpose and meaning of our society i believe that we have a collective duty to recommit ourselves to the american dream to strengthen that safety net put the rungs back on that ladder to the middle class and give every family the chance that so many of our parents and grandparents had this responsibility is one that has been neglected in washington for far too long a responsibility i intend to take very seriously as president knowing that we all have an obligation to alleviate poverty the next question is how do we do it we know what we need to do to help every family compete and prosper in a globalized world we need to make fundamental investments in education health care affordable housing science and technology and job training as well as helping parents support their children both financially and emotionally

2588242 any olympic athlete aspiring to a gold medal in beijing would do well to visit the emperors sunrise and carry the spirit of the jade to the field of contest
2588243 jade has been has been more than a decorative stone it has been the definitive metaphor for the very fabric of chinese culture an icon of excellence and virtue often described as the stone of heaven this historical connection to jade was somewhat obscured in the years of the tumultuous birth of the peoples republic but by the fitting decision to adorn the 2008 olympic gold medals with a jade inlay the connection has been jarred awake the decision was fitting because chinese tradition holds that an adornment of jade represents fine and noble excellence to be properly bestowed upon the worthiest of the worthy
2588244 there is an innate potency abiding within the heart of every fine piece of jade the emperors sunrise in particular radiates a positive energy that is fairly palpable any person who would visit the emperor as pratt calls it should look closely just above the centre on the polished face there one will see a tiny glowing eye from this eye emanates the power within the stone any who would touch it as long as their mind is open will at once be suffused with the dynamism from within if the supplicant be an olympic athlete they will go to their competition with an invincible connection to the gold they seek to all canadian athletes i say go to the emperor it is close by you in the heart of beijing touch the eye the power within will come upon you like a talisman carry it with you and do well in olympic competition

2588264 russian officials believe that it was the usa that orchestrated the current conflict the chairman of the state duma committee for security vladimir vasilyev believes that the current conflict is south ossetia is very reminiscent to the wars in iraq and kosovo

2588266 known for its extensive links to albanian and european crime syndicates the kla was supported from the outset in the mid 1990s by the cia and germanys intelligence agency the bundes nachrichten dienst bnd in the course of the 1999 war the kla was supported directly by nato
2588267 the kla had extensive links to al qaeda which was also involved in military training mujahideen mercenaries from a number of countries integrated the ranks of the kla which was involved in terrorist activities as well as political assassinations
2588268 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2588269 the rapid increase in us strategic influence in the caucasus has alarmed russian policy planners moscow is keen to take steps to shore up its eroding position in the region however russian officials have limited options with which to counter us moves while at the same time maintaining cordial relations with washington
2588270 the most prominent us moves in the caucasus are the decision to dispatch military advisers to georgia and a march 29 state department announcement on the lifting of an arms embargo imposed on armenia and azerbaijan both actions have the potential to tilt the military establishments of all three caucasus nations away from russia and towards nato
2588271 the rose revolution was not a simple uprising but was aided by the cia and ambassador richard miles think serbia from early 2002 onwards the cia had been operating in georgia supposedly to combat al qaeda
2588272 spokesmen for the state department and the c i a declined to confirm that mr woodruff was working for the intelligence agency but high ranking administration officials said he was adding that he was not spying on georgian officials but was training mr eduard shevardnadzes security forces
2588273 georgia was rocked by opposition rallies for six days last november as protesters occupied central tbilisi demanding saakashvilis resignation over allegations of corruption and increasing authoritarianism
2588274 the georgian leader responded by sending in riot police to crack down on protesters on november 7 over 500 people were injured according to human rights watch as police used rubber bullets tear gas and water cannons to break up the demonstrations
2588275 a total of around 1 650 soldiers form the us georgia and several other east european countries have begun exercises on the formerly russian controlled vaziani base the georgian defense ministry said
2588276 a deadly firefight between georgian troops and separatists in a russian backed breakaway region ahead of rices arrival a senior state department official who did not want to be identified told reporters that unchecked conflict in the region could lead to catastrophe the official also said moscow should realize its soviet empire is gone
2588277 in addition to the spy drones israel has also been supplying georgia with infantry weapons and electronics for artillery systems and has helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia according to koba liklikadze an independent military expert based in tbilisi former israeli generals also serve as advisers to the georgian military
2588278 georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years

2588369 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2588370 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2588371 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2588372 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2588373 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2588374 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2588375 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2588376 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2588377 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
2588378 i had one of those days in the studio that reminded me of why i love what i do

2588383 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
2588384 if i were to sleep with you would you stay at my store
2588385 there is almost no way we can imagine a return to the status quo
2588386 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2588387 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for the end of the russian bombings
2588388 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2588389 they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives are being lost and others are in danger
2588390 the smartest and most successful people in our society use their brains and not their fists
2588391 inseminate the un factual and leave me here to love
2588392 keep your bonnet and windscreen that way you dont have to buy a new one
2588393 oh no the bud vase is missing from your new car steal the one out of your old car and keep it
2588394 call me when you come for your first oil change and check up ill have you a ride to wherever you want to go
2588395 my last season at carlisle was hard i was in a couple of scuffles outside of football and appeared in court it affected my game and i ended up being loaned out to oxford
2588396 that was unsettling for me and when my contract ran out i knew it was time to leave
2588397 i have got some regrets from my time at carlisle and if i could turn back the clock and change things then i would but i wasnt as bad as some people made me out to be
2588398 there has been a bit of negativity surrounding the club recently
2588399 we havent got a big squad but if we can make some more signings things will start to look more positive
2588400 to his credit he is trying to take the football club forwards and a brand new stadium is going to do that that is a big incentive for everyone to get behind him and the team
2588401 al qaeda hurt us but not as much as rupert murdoch
2588402 we know that the teams visions for aircraft like space access operations and experience with rapid prototyping development still have a lot to offer the new space companies and maybe even inspire some of the old space companies to re engage in addition we will be using the event as a kick off for fund raising to develop a permanent xa exhibit at the museum
2588403 there will be plenty of organized and unorganized opportunities for people to meet old friends make new ones and share the fun frustrations hard work and accomplishments of the team
2588404 is about planning for the future as we reignite the vision profit from the experience and commit to creating a 21st century of aircraft like space access during the three days we will relish the accomplishment of the past and invent new paths to the future
2588405 yet another step we are taking to help the noreve brand become one of the most unique and recognized case manufacturers in the world
2588406 we are trying to make sure that anytime someone sees you with a noreve product the first thing that springs to their mind will be that super rich asshole
2588407 what does it matter if he gets what hes after
2588408 he had better get off the street now the guard will get him they went by five minutes ago
2588409 im sleepy now i never get into bed before three oclock he should have killed himself last week
2588410 i wish he would go home i never get to bed before three oclock what kind of hour is that to go to bed
2588411 hes lonely im not lonely i have a wife waiting in bed for me
2588412 you cant tell he might be better with a wife
2588413 his niece looks after him you said she cut him down
2588414 i wouldnt want to be that old an old man is a nasty thing
2588415 not always this old man is clean he drinks without spilling even now drunk look at him
2588416 i dont want to look at him i wish he would go home he has no regard for those who must work
2588417 you talk like an old man yourself he can buy a bottle and drink at home
2588418 and you you have no fear of going home before your usual hour
2588419 no i have never had confidence and i am not young
2588420 i am of those who like to stay late at the cafe
2588421 with all those who do not want to go to bed with all those who need a light for the night
2588422 it is not only a question of youth and confidence although those things are very beautiful each night i am reluctant to close up because there may be some one who needs the cafe
2588423 you do not understand this is a clean and pleasant cafe it is well lighted the light is very good and also now there are shadows of the leaves
2588424 the light is very bright and pleasant but the bar is unpolished
2588425 sinceramente no quando una squadra viene dalla serie b ha sempre bisogno di un tempo ragionevole di ambientamento invece il napoli riuscito subito ad entrare tra le migliori del campionato onestamente io avrei messo la firma per arrivare in europa in due stagioni eppure ce labbiamo fatta al primo anno questo merito della societ del tecnico della squadra e dei tifosi abbiamo disputato un campionato eccellente e non va mai dimenticato adesso cercheremo di onorare al meglio il posto conquistato in coppa uefa
2588426 s ci stiamo trovando bene l dietro ma una buona tenuta difensiva non dipende solo da tre uomini bens da tutta la squadra se gira la squadra va bene ogni reparto serve lapporto di tutti gli uomini in campo in ogni momento della partita
2588427 ed questo il nostro punto di forza quando c da lottare il
2588428 bella esperienza contro il napoli temo hamsik i napoletani saranno accolti benissimo
2588429 affrontare il napoli vuol dire giocare contro un club di serie a campionato molto importante per noi sar una bella esperienza i tempi sono cambiati in tutto il mondo spero sia cos anche in albania il nostro paese ha tanta voglia di essere una parte vitale e positiva delleuropa
2588430 i nostri punti di forza sono la tecnica individuale dei nostri calciatori che sono cresciuti insieme il carattere forte del nostro allenatore la nostra tifoseria e la seriet del presidente
2588431 so they had to come back through this entrance to go to their team transporters
2588432 i e mailed kanaans assistant and told her we were coming to te kentucky race and asked if she could do me a favor
2588433 i asked if she would put the engagement ring in a glove so when tony gave it to her i would and ask kerri to marry me
2588434 i thought maybe tk had lost his wedding ring in the finger of the glove
2588435 i remember when we had less than 25 percent eligible
2588436 it s a family application so you only have to return one per family
2588437 we do have students and parents who live in a world where the income comes hard
2588438 the lunch is designed to be 1 3 of what a child needs nutritionally during the day
2588439 the students will get a 4 digit personal identification number that they enter into a key pad and it opens their lunch account if they are eligible for reduced lunch it will charge 40 cents from the account
2588440 we re going to implement the systems gradually through the school year
2588441 it will be more of a streamlined system but we re not going to eliminate any staff
2588442 we deliver school supplies to 23 public and parochial schools
2588443 we buy a lot of school supplies to take out
2588444 the kids can have the tools they need to do their work
2588445 that s what this is all about the schools used to provide these but budgets have gotten tighter and they can no longer do that so teachers started buying things for their students we want this program to help them make sure the kids have what they need to learn
2588446 if kids are embarrassed about things at school they won t learn as well that s why we don t have our name on anything we take to the schools we just want them to have what they need to learn any kid can have this we don t discriminate they don t have to be low income there are many many good parents but there are some who don t pay attention to what their children need for school we want to make sure those kids have what they need too
2588447 now we re getting some donations but we still have to buy a lot but we are getting good prices for things we have to buy we don t make a lot of noise about this we do a lot for children this is just one thing
2588448 we rely on a lot of help for sorting everything
2588449 we get help from church youth groups and students from midland lutheran college we get help each year from teens who come from camp fontanelle we need a lot of help with this
2588450 the biggest challenge we have is getting all of the supplies
2588451 the store had ordered 1 000 cases of notebooks but they got in only 180 that becomes a problem for everyone trying to get notebooks there are 24 notebooks in a case we can usually get along pretty good with prices now finding enough volume is the problem
2588452 that s not ideal but we do what we need to do
2588453 it s time consuming but it s a satisfying part of what we do we know that these kids are getting what they need we know that this is making a difference
2588454 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2588455 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2588456 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2588457 do you often hear voices that no one else can hear
2588458 i heard the voices again are they here are there three adolescent boys in here
2588459 those kids they were saying hold on over and over
2588460 all i hear is the promotional music were playing i think its the jonas brothers
2588461 thats what my daughter said too you guys watch too much disney channel
2588462 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2588463 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2588464 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2588465 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2588466 whether it is the deep metaphors of covenant as in judaism islam and reformed protestantism sacrament as in roman catholicism or eastern orthodoxy the yin and yang of confucianism the quasi sacramentalism of hinduism or the mysticism often associated with allegedly modern romantic love
2588467 humans tend to find values in marriage that call them beyond the mundane and everyday
2588468 compared to married people the non married have higher rates of mortality than the married about 50 percent higher among women and 250 percent higher among men
2588469 a gay person can be a good role model for a child
2588470 accept two men or two women living together like a married couple
2588471 celebrate an infinite array of sexual or intimate choices as equally desirable or valid
2588472 the exclusive and permanent commitment of the married partners to one another
2588473 the voluntary union of two persons as spouses to the exclusion of all others
2588474 at once a deeply personal commitment to another human being and a highly public celebration of ideals of mutuality companionship intimacy fidelity and family
2588475 a stable family structure in which children will be reared educated and socialized
2588476 is the foremost setting for the education and socialization of children
2588477 encourages parents to remain committed to each other and to their children as they grow
2588478 opposite sex exclusive child centered this whole section of the report makes no sense
2588479 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2588480 are all dads equal biology versus marriage as a basis for paternal investment
2588481 adolescent well being in cohabiting married and single parent families
2588482 the researchers work is magnitudes better and more sustainable than katzs scandinavian evidence
2588483 as both of these examples show what kurtz says is ofte n much more reasonable than what i keep reading people say kurtz says
2588484 regardless of what sullivan wrote though kurtz still fails to account for the significance of the introduction of alternatives to marriage key differences between rps and marriage with regards to adoption and the fact that the increase in nonmarital childbearing has been rising since the 1970s and continues to rise in countries with legal recognition of same sex relationships and those without
2588485 kurtzs biggest fear is that same sex marriage is part of a movement that will lead to the equalization of marriage and cohabitation
2588486 yeah he is i met her her names becky i think
2588487 some people are against ssm on moral grounds if society recognizes gay marriage it essentially puts the states seal of approval on such relationships
2588488 i love you so much im willing to get the government to make our relationship as insert metric here as a heterosexual relationship
2588489 i disagree that recognition means the state is putting a seal of approval
2588490 what is missing is the core idea that parenthood is a category based on biological realities beyond governmental redefinition
2588491 civil unions simply do not come close to offering the same protections marriage does
2588492 civil unions can not give all even most of the civil rights and obligations that civil marriage does
2588493 a homosexual shouldnt demand that marriages uniqueness be deprecated either
2588494 just as applicable to other family arrangements that are also denied a right to marriage
2588495 just as applicable to other family arrangements that are also denied a right to marriage
2588496 i think that marriage would greatly benefit children of same sex couples and it would help society and the families involved by promoting and protecting stable and secure relationships
2588497 have arguments in favor of allowing those couples to marry
2588498 these arguments could be used elsewhere does nothing to deny that they are arguments in favor of allowing same sex couples to marry
2588499 i find the use of gender classifications unwarranted and problematic
2588500 intended to regulate chasten and refine the intercourse between the sexes and to multiply preserve and improve the species
2588501 a man is presumed to be the father of a child
2588502 conceivable that the legislature could conclude that opposite sex partners offer advantages in th e area of child rearing although
2588503 legitimate interest in prohibiting conduct which may threaten that institution
2588504 legislative classification is valid if it is rational and bears some relationship to the object intended to be accomplished
2588505 will not diminish the validity or dignity of opposite sex marriage
2588506 we have no doubt that marriage will continue to be a vibrant and revered institution
2588507 there are arguments in favor of allowing same sex couples to marry
2588508 marriage would greatly benefit children of couples and it would help society and the families involved by promoting and protecting stable and secure relationships
2588509 this benefit might not suffice to justify same sex marriage
2588510 statement a is that there are arguments in favor of allowing same sex couples to marry
2588511 the rights and obligations that a parent has to a child
2588512 two things that i think the first year of marriage equality in ma is indicating if those trends continue and i believe they will it will start to separate the opposition between those who had sincere doubts about the affects of same sex marriage but were proven wrong and those who held just plain old bigotted views
2588513 on the first point is about public opinion not effects one year is telling us a lot in one year that the reality of same sex marriage changes opinions of the populace that has changed in a year dramatically
2588514 good then help me fight for a federally recognized civil union law that is also recognized in all states
2588515 im sure the women themselves had nothing to do with securing their right to vote
2588516 when the shoe is on the other foot you know thats when it hits the fan
2588517 just as skunk and polecat denote the same animal civil unions and gay marriage are the same
2588518 same sex couples should seek marriage like rights through another avenue such as civil unions
2588519 were going to hold mr nashifs feet to the fire
2588520 he said he didnt oppose civil unions and its my understanding that measure 36 did not prohibit civil unions
2588521 public attitudes and private attitudes towards homosexuality that is really what is at the heart of this thats what it is all about and recognition of same sex marriage is the most symbolic acknowledgment that homosexuality simply appears to be a normally occurring phenomenon in nature
2588522 to justify to the outside world the love that you have in your heart and that is wrong that is wrong and unacceptable
2588523 no religious employer or business will be required to recognize a civil union if it is contrary to the bona fide religious tenets of such religious employer or business
2588524 religious organizations should not be exempt from recognizing respecting and honoring same sex civil unions
2588525 there is a long standing commitment that all amendments will be treated fairly whether they come at committee or report stage
2588526 the prime minister told caucus what hes said publicly as part of an open process amendments will be considered fairly on their merits
2588527 it is recognized that officials of religious groups are free to refuse to perform marriages that are not in accordance with their religious beliefs
2588528 no religious institution or affiliate shall be compelled by authority to rent or lease its property for the purposes of a same sex marriage
2588529 1 they try to extend benefits to one set of people based on the capacities of another class of people 2 they extend governments arm to governing romance
2588530 in the popular refurendums from oregon to kansas to north caroline people do not support conflating civil unions with marriage
2588531 religious organizations should not be exempt from recognizing respecting and honoring same sex civil unions
2588532 1 they try to extend benefits to one set of people based on the capacities of another class of people 2 they extend governments arm to governing romance
2588533 1 they try to extend benefits to one set of people based on the capacities of another class of people 2 they extend governments arm to governing romance
2588534 in the popular refurendums from oregon to kansas to north caroline people do not support conflating civil unions with marriage
2588535 after getting people to vote for it with assurances that they could still support civil unions through the legislature
2588536 does little to promote the stability and security which would benefit those couples their children and the welfare of oregon
2588537 if you pass civil unions then there wont be a demand for marriage
2588538 nicely frames your attempts to link gay marriage to incestuous marriage
2588539 to send a message to society about homosexuality that homosexuality and heterosexuality are not morally equivalent
2588540 that homosexuality is a sin and should not be sanctioned even by quasimarriage unions such as domestic partnerships and civil unions
2588541 plaintiffs started the political fight that resulted in the adoption of section 29
2588542 the decisionmaker selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part
2588543 to date no such rights exist you cant impinge on a so called right until you have one you cant lose something you never had
2588544 before ssm proponents can convince people that their agenda is worthwhile they need to persuade people that protecting traditional marriage is unnecessary
2588545 when a person enters an intimate relationship with someone of the same sex a liberty is exercised not denied
2588546 suppose there was no such thing as state recognition of marriage what good reason would prompt society through the state to elevate the same sex intimate relationship
2588547 trey thats not much of an argument now is it galois yours is no better
2588548 look to the traditions and collective conscience of our people to determine whether a principle is so rooted there
2588549 many religions recognize marriage as having spiritual significance and therefore the commitment of marriage may be an exercise of religious faith as well as an expression of personal dedication
2588550 recognized that the right to marry establish a home and bring up children is a central part of the liberty protected by the due process clause
2588551 as fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race
2588552 because unlike gay marriage polygamy has been and still is condoned by many religions and societies
2588553 our society considers marriage between a man and woman to play a vital role in propagating the species and in providing the ideal environment for raising children
2588554 the role that marriage plays in procreation and providing the optimal environment for child rearing
2588555 this amicus brief filed by more than 100 new jersey clergy members
2588556 putin was saying we are going to make them pay
2588557 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
2588558 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
2588559 there is no possibility of drawing nato or the international community into this
2588560 there is none there is not a danger of a regional conflict in our mind
2588561 strategically the russians have been sending signals that they really wanted to flex their muscles and theyre upset about kosovo
2588562 if someone went to the russians and said ok kosovo for iran wed have a deal
2588563 bernie mac just say what you want to say but cant
2588564 youre still going have to do the dishes and the laundry and all that
2588565 you were on air force one and you couldnt stop to pick up the kids
2588566 today were celebrating 150 years of oil from oil springs which is 150 years of oil for the world
2588567 this is the site of the worlds first commercial oil well its also the site of canadas first refinery and the site of the worlds first registered petroleum company
2588568 we had everything from fire trucks to the kids on bikes old vehicles we even had a modern day tank truck that carries the oil of here to this very day
2588569 nylon lipstick gasoline and glue we use oil in most things its true
2588570 because oil makes lifes things today what will we do when it runs out someday
2588571 weve got enough national and provincial and world firsts that we think this site and the oil heritage district of lambton county warrants world heritage status
2588572 he never left behind the ones he made in high school
2588573 if you were in a bad mood he would make you in a great mood
2588574 could never stand still there was a whole world to see and everywhere he went he brought light and joy
2588575 if youre looking at a breast in that manner youre watching too much television
2588576 its kinda funny in a store that sells nursing bras
2588577 its like lifting coffee to my mouth my babys hungry so she eats im thirsty so i drink
2588578 the art of the business lunch building relationships between 12 and 2
2588579 ive probably hosted about 4 000 client lunches now and it caused my sales to increase by more than 2 000 percent
2588580 an outside sales trainer can pump up a sales force and spike sales for the next 90 to 120 days but the buzz doesnt last so you get peaks and valleys
2588581 when you spend face time with clients over a meal people are more relaxed
2588582 the added benefit is that theyll introduce you to their circle of friends its like dropping a pebble into a pond you get endless ripples
2588583 its about the greater level of intimacy that the breaking of bread together brings about the point is to get people out of the office and into a setting more amenable to friendly dialogue
2588584 its an investment worth making because it gives you a unique opportunity to demonstrate you and your companys capability and likeability
2588585 enhancing your personal brand is best accomplished face to face and over a meal
2588586 basically people do business with people they like and knowing good business etiquette is important for relationship management
2588587 its paramount that you know how to conduct yourself in social business situations
2588588 once you understand the rules practice can help you develop that sense of confidence
2588589 choose a restaurant where the food and service are consistently good and where you can have a conversation
2588590 the price is important if the lunch costs more than someones car payment she may be uncomfortable
2588591 if you go to a place and cant get a seat youre not going to impress anyone
2588592 the person who did the inviting always pays you may want to tell the person he is a guest to avoid confusion
2588593 at a fancy restaurant with multiple courses and utensils the general rule is to start with the outside utensils and move in
2588594 keep the conversation upbeat and avoid controversial subjects like religion and politics
2588595 follow the hosts lead in conversation if hes talking hobbies dont switch the subject and ask about that report you turned in
2588596 no one wants to hear that youre cheating on your spouse or hate your boss
2588597 never talk about other people in the industry its a small world and you dont know who your client knows
2588598 that way you can avoid ordering a steak when your host is having a sandwich
2588599 so make this business lunch about them make them feel special
2588600 often a good way to bridge the gap between personal and professional conversation is to connect the dots
2588601 if you dont know it makes a great topic of conversation ask questions about what she does
2588602 look for affinities college where you grew up family life personal interests or hobbies if you can find those you can build a dialogue at a different level
2588603 the more you talk about those things the better youre equipped to help the other person and yourself
2588604 figuratively you want to be sitting on the same side of the table as your clients
2588605 youre not there to interrogate them or persuade them to do something they dont want to do at a business lunch
2588606 she had just sold her home and bought another one and just needed to relax
2588607 later when her company cut the advertising budget she didnt cut us because as she told me you always take me to lunch its such an important aspect of business
2588608 to make a successful hire managers need to look for fit to the company culture as well as function
2588609 a meal is a good way to get additional fit feedback
2588610 now they are going to raise the bar and see how your social skills stand up
2588611 lunch could differentiate you from one or two other candidates this is your time to stand out
2588612 try approaching the meal with the idea that you and the interviewer have a shared decision to make about employment
2588613 that will shift your feelings about who has power in the situation you may be able to relax enough so that your likeability shines through
2588614 we were focused on the products that were going out for grinding
2588615 we were focusing on the product that we tied to the initial illnesses
2588616 if we had a strengthening of the dollar that would help
2588617 let me go and i can help you more from heaven
2588618 i will not forget you even if a mother forgets her child isaiah 49
2588619 it was all that was promised here in the fabulous chameleon known as the birds nest it spread like the magic fire of some great forest across the vast and for so long hidden land
2588620 this it was hard if not impossible to dispute was the greatest show the world had ever seen and it brought joy that became delirium in 1 3 million people
2588621 the launch of the 29th olympics was so stunningly choreographed so meticulously planned full dress rehearsals were under way more than a year ago and went so far back into chinas ancient history you suspected that confucious himself might have been pleased

2588642 nonsense if canadian artists produce world class art then it will be noticed on the world stage with or without government assistance moreover the tories are not telling artists to stop producing their movies paintings alternative rock or books rather they are simply telling them to stop financing their international junkets from the wallets of overburdened taxpayers except for those on their way to boring conferences in finland or cocktails with cubas communist junta canadians will no doubt heartily approve

2588647 governments around the world continually try as ever to boost their countrys international standing and influence but instead of pursuing these aims through warfare domination subversion machiavellian statecraft and secret alliances as in the past many are reaching for a fashionable new tool public diplomacy originally coined in the 1960s public diplomacy is a means of advancing national foreign policy security and economic objectives by engaging directly with peoples rather than with their governments thereby rendering them more receptive and sympathetic to a given message or policy sceptics say this is merely a posh name for propaganda proponents say public diplomacys purposes are more benign

2588658 i lament the loss of a ferociously funny and hardcore family man my thoughts are with his wife rhonda and their family bernie mac you are already missed
2588659 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did
2588660 bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have
2588661 losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in
2588662 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2588663 its hard to put into words just how i feel and what a painful loss this is bernie was a brother a friend and one of the comic masters of our time sharing the marquee with him during the phenomenon of the kings of comedy tour bonded us like family and created a unique moment in comic history marking some of the most meaningful memorable and fun times of our lives his comedic approach was his own brand and will definitely stand the test of time the level of his talent always inspired me and other comedians to bring their a game i promise you that you never wanted to be the guy who had to follow bernies set as a husband and father he was the man and my thoughts and prayers are with his family he will truly be missed but so well remembered
2588664 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities
2588665 bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real
2588666 that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try
2588667 bernie mac was a gifted talent whose comment came from an authentic and highly personal place he was a tremendous live performer and a wonderful actor fox was proud to be the home of the bernie mac show and all of us at fox and 20th century fox television extend our deepest sympathies to his wife rhonda and daughter jeniece

2588677 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2588678 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2588679 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2588680 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2588681 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2588682 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2588683 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2588697 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis

2588736 white americans in the north pretty much thought violence against blacks was a southern thing the springfield riot really came as a bolt of lightning to northern newspaper readers
2588737 the question was if it can happen in springfield maybe it can happen anywhere
2588738 this was the right thing to do theres no question in my mind
2588739 they turned it into tourism dollars this horror that occurred in their hometown
2588740 this would be like seeing a shirt that had the towers falling on 9 11 people making money off the tragedy that everyone had to endure
2588741 the negroes would come to the window and rush back they didnt dare come out for fear theyd get shot they went back in and anybody that i knew or talked to said there were negroes in there that were burned up
2588742 its a funny thing i can understand why few people want to talk you can see right away that youre accused of participation just by assumption
2588743 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2588744 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2588745 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2588746 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean

2588750 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2588751 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2588752 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2588753 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2588754 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2588755 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2588756 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2588757 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do

2588767 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2588768 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2588769 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2588770 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2588771 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2588772 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2588773 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2588774 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2588775 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2588776 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2588777 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2588778 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2588779 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2588780 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2588781 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2588782 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2588783 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools

2588785 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2588786 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2588789 we just have to do it again in south africa we have seen that a lot can happen in one week but thats the standard we have set ourselves now and we cant go below it
2588790 the wallabies hurt us in sydney but desire and desperation came out last weekend and we have to take that physicality in against the springboks
2588791 we have set a benchmark now and we cant afford to go backwards or we will come second
2588792 just the way the competition is how tight it is its going to be a massive game
2588793 as a player you want to be in this pressure cooker stuff these are the games you really relish theres a lot at stake the tri nations and then the bledisloe cup with our match in brisbane
2588794 these are the games guys should be striving for apart from the world cup they are that tough especially beating south africa over there
2588795 the way the springboks have defended has been good but maybe we just havent been as smart as we should have against them maybe we need to use guys like maa nonu and conrad smith differently i think we can be a lot better
2588796 i was very disappointed that ryan chose to make ill informed hypocritical comments about what is happening in new zealand when he hasnt been a part of what is happening here for a long time pignata said
2588797 ryan hasnt played for the all whites since 2004 that was in the ill fated loss to vanuatu
2588798 rickis all whites are one game away from going to the confederations cup and a play off to go to the world cup
2588799 rickis been the coach of the all whites since 2005 and in all of that time ryan has not been available for the all whites
2588800 we have a great relationship with them we are totally supportive of what they are doing for new zealand football
2588801 and we knew shane and tony of course were never priority players they made no secret they always wanted ryan simon and chris and thats who they got
2588802 a lot of what he mentioned was in the past were only interested in whats happening now and in the future
2588803 theres a good feel good factor in football at the moment i dont want to focus on ryans comments
2588804 we have to pick a team that is going to be as competitive as possible
2588805 but to suggest were not supporting the development of the game in new zealand is ill informed
2588806 we have nine all whites playing for the phoenix under the all whites coach so why would he criticise us its ridiculous
2588807 would ryan prefer we had those players in the lower leagues in england playing for a coach who has no real investment in them instead
2588808 says hes a democrat i dont know what his concept of democracy is but to me this is not democracy
2588809 president hugo chavez did not create the disqualifications against the opposition

2588811 they want a place where we can eat somali food and just to be
2588812 after a couple of weeks we get together to eat and talk
2588813 they are nice and they teach me how to do my work
2588814 theres nothing specific or different about the somali workers that i note
2588815 this is a town thats home to 26 nationalities we never bothered to do the statistics or research ourselves but generally speaking weve always had many different people from many different backgrounds
2588816 the right people who could appreciate and enjoy this type of work
2588817 they kind of mingle among themselves and they dont bother anybody
2588818 some of them have left because they dont like slaughterhouses but a lot of them have decided to stay for now
2588819 i did know bernie mac the unfortunate passing of somebody so young and especially a comedian someone who paid their dues is sad he was the least known when kings of comedy came out and maybe the funniest of them all to have success in stand up and tv and movies and be a great husband and father to his kids is a legacy to inspire anyone to do well as all comedians are soldiers he will be solely missed by anyone in comedy
2588820 its something weve wanted to do for a while but we wanted to make sure we got it right

2588835 no queremos exportar esto a nadie pero es parte de nuestra cultura y eso es algo que en bolivia es as
2588836 en la poca de la colonia tambi n existi el masticado ha existido durante la republica y va a existir durante los pr ximos mil a os y entonces eso no tiene nada que ver con la producci n y fabricaci n de coca na
2588837 no hablamos de erradicaci n porque nunca se va a erradicar no hablamos de hoja de coca cero sino de coca na cero no queremos ni un miligramo ni de clorhidrato ni de pasta b sica de coca na
2588838 en bolivia queremos todo lo necesario en hoja de coca para satisfacer la demanda legal sanitaria ritual y cultural de nuestro pa s
2588839 no queremos ni una hect rea m s de lo que es necesario para nuestro consumo total interno que es inofensivo que no es drogadicci n que no supone procesos industriales de transformaci n sino que supone el consumo de la hoja de coca en su estado natural

2588841 underground es una de las canciones que ser incluidas en el nuevo disco pero no se sabe si ser el primer single el lbum se llamara under my control y esta previsto para salir a la venta en francia el 15 de diciembre pero quien sabe todo puede cambiar

2588843 the world we are experiencing today is the result of our collective consciousness and if we want a new world each of us must start taking responsibility for helping create it
2588844 we have a responsibility to put the public health and the environment before profits these bills spell out common sense precautions
2588845 karen my priorities are getting through the day you have no idea how much is on my plate right now
2588846 that framed picture my aunt susan gave me of us at the beach that i put on the wall but i really hate because every time i look at it i see my sunburn and think about the sand that was in our picnic lunch how can that be doing harm just hanging on the wall
2588847 wrestling is about so much more than what happens inside the ring
2588848 with the tna mobile game fans will get to experience and control the action both in and out of the ring
2588849 tna is consistently searching out new media platforms to better serve our fans worldwide and mobile gaming will put our brand at the cutting edge of gaming
2588850 we are looking forward to bringing tna wrestling to dublin for the first time and playing a venue with such an incredible history
2588851 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2588852 she was like so pretty the dress she was wearing i mean wow it was like amazing
2588853 i mean like if you are saying that you really want to go well like you should make plans
2588854 you should of seen the look on his face like i mean it was like scary
2588855 how many like times do you expect me to like wait here for you
2588856 i expected like a big raise in my last review but like he just handed me the results like
2588857 tnatv is the next logical step in the growth of the company the ultimate goal is to deliver the best product possible to the fans and now we will have all the tools to do that
2588858 it is a beautiful facility first class all the way we cant wait move into our new home
2588859 all you bicyclers are the same you hate cars and just want to slow us down
2588860 no i dont have to share the road you share the road and get the f out of my way
2588861 motorcycles dont swerve in front of cars to slow them down you cyclist deserve to get hit with the way you act
2588862 hey we didnt know the hells angles were in town if you will please stop harassing the grandmas
2588863 ibu dimana makam kakek mengapa tiap menjelang ramadan kita hanya mengunjungi nisan nenek bu
2588864 missing spring if found please return to mother nature as soon as possible
2588865 ahh man that was easy i cant believe i wasted that much energy on worrying awesome
2588866 you come back and do the aff and its on me its already been taken care of
2588867 you are the most intelligent person i have seen all day everyone else is here buying material goods for their sense gratification yet you are reading the word of god
2588868 every bbti director is responsible to see that the paintings owned by his division are properly cared for
2588869 they should be kept in good condition properly exhibited or stored and proper records should be kept
2588870 when i suggested to my friends that they visit the hare krishnas they refused
2588871 so i left them and hitchhiked alone to holland france switzerland and austria visiting temples along the way
2588872 would you mind reading my translation of teachings of lord caitanya and correcting any mistakes you find
2588873 after teachings of lord caitanya was done hungarian book publication went into overdrive
2588874 and i soon found myself at the north european bbt headquarters in sweden over the next few years i copy edited and proofread science of self realization krishnabook srimad bhagavatam caitanya caritamrita and plenty more by 1996 we had completed all of srila prabhupadas books
2588875 later youll remember these days as the best times in your life
2588876 prabhupadas books being translated printed and distributed in hungary is the real aspirin for my headaches
2588877 i wanted to create the aspirin to cure my gurus headache
2588878 when i began investigating and documenting the history of prabhupadas books in 2003 it seemed more important than ever
2588879 the bbt was increasingly under fire from within iskcon for their editorial changes defending themselves from criticisms which had little or nothing to do with reality
2588880 it will also include resources such as handwritten corrections and references that pra bhupada used such as sridhara swamis srimad bhagavatam commentaries and dr radhakrishnans gita
2588881 devotees working on srila prabhupadas books will be able to compare everything and understand how the editions we have now developed over the years
2588882 these are accompanied by information on how to understand editorial changes who made them when they were made and how accurate or inaccurate they were
2588883 there were gorgeous orchards and gardens all around and the whole city was encircled by cannons so that no enemy could enter very easily
2588884 despite the recent attacks on the editors for making changes
2588885 its a fact that the bbts highest priority is always to bring the books closer to what prabhupada originally meant
2588886 and often without background history and information to help you understand what prabhupada wanted to say its hard to reflect the mood intended in a different language a translator shouldnt have to guess if he doesnt understand it that means the reader has no chance
2588887 love is what makes two people sit in the middle of a bench when there is plenty of room at both ends
2588888 to love another person is to see the face of god
2588889 habis itu pesawat baru diterbangkan instruktur akan menerbangkannya terlebih dahulu ketika sudah mengudara pesawat baru di take over kepada pemain pemula awalnya pemain pemula akan belajar mengendalikan pesawat saat di udara
2588890 lebih baik kalau kita menggunakan pesawat bermesin lebih stabil mudah dikendalikan dan bisa belajar landing dan take off kalau yang elektrik tidak bisa seperti itu karena cara take off nya dengan dilempar lagi pula di tingkat advance kita pasti ketemu dengan pesawat bermesin
2588891 meski mengendalikannya tidak seperti yang lain tapi ada kenikmatan tersendiri saya ingin mempopulerkannya karena harga belinya hampir sama dengan yang biasa saya menyediakan beberapa model untuk dijual
2588892 jangankan untuk mengetahui bagaimana mengendalikan pesawat ini mencari penjualnya pun biasanya cukup sulit makanya selain sebagai penjual saya pun berniat menjadi instruktur bagi para pemula
2588893 saya merasa buat apa income besar kalau kita tidak sehat kalau sehat pendapatan kan pasti bisa kita cari makanya saya putuskan untuk berhenti bekerja dan lebih berkonsentrasi mengurus anak dan kebun organik
2588894 biasanya saya akan mengambil hasil panen tanaman organik ini 2 kali seminggu untuk dijual dan menjadi bahan baku rumah makan saya
2588895 ikan ikan yang ada di sini terutama diberi makan dedaunan sisa hasil panen bibit ikan ini disebar sekitar 3 tahun lalu jadi sekarang mungkin sudah generasi ketiga
2588896 cara membuat kompos kering dengan membiarkan dedaunan membusuk setelah itu daun yang membusuk tersebut disiram air diaduk dan dapat digunakan setelah 3 bulan hasil akhirnya hampir seperti abu gosok sedangkan kompos basah tinggal dikasih air saja
2588897 dulu saya pernah memelihara ayam tapi sering dimakan musang kalo sapi makananya terlalu banyak jadi saya hanya pelihara kambing yang rumput untuk makannya bisa dari kebun sendiri
2588898 mungkin itu karena kebiasaan aja orang yang biasa makan penganan non organik akan merasakan sensasi berbeda bila makan penganan organik tapi nantinya juga akan terbiasa apalagi penganan organik kandungannya lebih sehat
2588899 cincau ini rasanya beda karena dibuat hanya dari daun cincau rasanya lebih nikmat bila dicampur gula batu sebagai pemanis dan daun pandan
2588900 membuat masakan atau penganan organik perlu resep khusus apalagi jenis masakan ini meminimalisir meniadakan pemakaian penyedap rasa monosodiumglutamat kita harus tahu penyedap rasa alami yang bisa membuat masakan atau penganan tetap enak dimakan
2588901 kalau hanya berkebun dan menjual bahan mentah tidak ada value added nya lagi pula saya tidak terlalu mengikuti perkembangan harga pasar malah kadang saya tak tahu harga pasar untuk menjual bahan mentah tertentu
2588902 kami tidak pernah memaksakan warga menanam tanaman di depan rumah masing masing hal itu timbul atas kesadaran sendiri
2588903 di sini sudah hampir semua rumah menanam tumbuhan namun untuk pot gantung terbilang baru setengah warga saja yang menanamnya seperti di rt 02 03 04 dan 05
2588904 saya sudah tinggal di kampung ini bertahun tahun namun tiga tahun ini saya melihat perubahannya yang sangat pesat selain terlihat lebih asri warganya pun sangat kompak dalam segala hal
2588905 jakarta untuk itu tambah mujiono dirinya berharap agar semua kampung yang ada di indonesia khususnya di jakarta lebih memperhatikan lingkungannya
2588906 jika lingkungan kita bersih niscaya penyakit pun akan enggan mampir di kampung kita
2588907 selain kekompakan dalam menata lingkungan masyarakat di sini juga mempunyai jiwa sosial yang sangat tinggi mereka giat membantu sesama yang membutuhkan pertolongan
2588908 really i didnt have your name but i didnt check my voicemail today so thats probably why
2588909 she said the really key thing to understand is you dont have to worry
2588910 the way the swiss government approaches this is that every person who is a swiss citizen has the right to be able to live decently
2588911 for me that was just like such a huge wave of relief to have somebody tell you you dont ever have to worry about how your child is going to be cared for

2588914 seaweeds are popularly described as plants but biologists do not consider them plants in biology all true plants belong to the kingdom plantae they should not be confused with aquatic plants such as seagrasses which are vascular plants
2588915 seaweeds are popularly described as plants but biologists do not consider them plants in biology all true plants belong to the kingdom plantae they should not be confused with aquatic plants such as seagrasses which are vascular plants 2 where is it found
2588916 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
2588917 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations
2588918 however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games
2588919 sites that you need to have for your job its important that you raise them for bocogs awareness
2588920 the censorship situation for those web sites has not loosened at all
2588921 we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region thats very industrially active
2588922 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming
2588923 these technologies will provide new estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region

2588925 from what i can tell their approval process is not very strict at all
2588926 its more technical than content related is what it seems like to us i think they run it start it up and if it doesnt crash they approve it they brainlessly click through and if theres problems they remove it is what it seems like
2588927 theyre shooting themselves in the foot these days theyre probably just understaffed
2588928 well see how it goes hopefully they dont get too much of the bad press and it doesnt ruin the iphone because i want to develop for it
2588929 company reserves the right to anything we damn well please whenever we like because we can

2588939 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2588940 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2588941 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2588942 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2588943 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2588944 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2588945 if the museum has a photography allowed policy in their atrium as explicitly expressed on their website and someone identifies themselves as a photographer artist and paying and supporting member of museum i would expect less hostility aggression and harassment photography is an art and those of us who choose to practice the great art of street photography ought not be targeted by bullies like blint many of the great artists artists being shown in the sf moma itself were practitioners of street photography it is ironic that the great cartier bresson who took thousands of photographs of unsuspecting people in his work hangs in the museum while a photographer practicing the same type of work gets ejected by a power trippy asshole its hypocritical and disappointing it is unfortunate that one of my first experiences as a paying member of the sf moma had to be full of hatred bitterness and harassment

2589165 my body was kind of freezing up tightening up a little bit could never really fully relax out there it was tough running around and having trouble breathing out there
2589166 he had trouble breathing or whatever it was actually throughout the second set whereas i had absolutely no problem
2589167 i really hoped because i was on top of him all the way through the second set that i would get that crucial break and then i could sort of race away with it

2589189 todays decision not only places these ways of life in peril but sets the stage for an ecological and public health catastrophe we have no choice but to uphold our commitment to protect the holy san francisco peaks
2589190 only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective emotional religious experience that is the presence of recycled wastewater on the peaks is offensive to the plaintiffs religious sensibilities the diminishment of spiritual fulfillment serious though it may be is not a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion
2589191 the court places itself in the position of judging the legitimacy of native american beliefs and practices it becomes the arbiter of religion which is not the proper role for the courts the evidence clearly shows that the peaks are important to 13 of the tribes in the southwestern united states and that using sewer water to make snow on them constitutes a significant burden on the tribes ability to practice their religion

2589198 this decision is a painful affirmation of the lack of protection for our religious freedom
2589199 it is a bitter reminder that not all citizens are equal in this country but just as the civil rights movement did not give up when courts delivered blow after blow we will not give up until our rights are fully upheld we the youth will continue to stand up for our cultural survival

2589241 aber wenn das wirklich eine option f r uns werden soll m ssen wir das ausgiebig unter solchen bedingungen testen ich wei noch nicht mal wie man das anstellen w rde aber wir m ssen uns dahinterklemmen weil es noch wesentlich mehr sachen zu tun gibt in der vergangenheit als wir uns hier gezeigt haben hatten wir das gehandhabt nach dem motto ok wir schnallen einen scheibenwischer dran ein bremslicht eine scheibenheizung haben es aber nie besonders ernst genommen

2589244 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2589245 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2589246 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2589247 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2589248 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2589249 im going to my happy place and you cant come
2589250 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2589251 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2589252 shifting the focus from social welfare to social development is about considering the wellbeing of the whole population and communities within that population rather than solely focusing on the traditional family group we must cater for the diversity we know exists by this i mean the range of relationships from single couples triples blended de facto and so on thats where were going with social policy
2589253 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2589254 i am a great sinner and christ is a great savior
2589255 we must work at our responsibility as parents as if everything in life counted on it because in fact everything in life does count on it
2589256 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2589257 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity
2589258 only 4 years old the heating element went out and why bother well just get another
2589259 i could only imagine how many haggard and depraved eyes were regarding me hungrily from behind the closed shutters i tried not to think about it already i was beginning to feel like an especially toothsome steak in a meat market however no one called enticingly from the shutters those devious mentalities throbbing away in their dark apartments were apparently more subtle seducers i thought that a note at least might flutter down a frozen orange juice can came flying out of one of the windows and barely missed me i stooped over and picked it up in order to inspect the empty tin cylinder for a communication of some sort but only a viscous residue on concentrated juice trickled out on my hand was this some obscene message while i was pondering the matter and staring up at the window from which the can had been hurled an old vagrant approached the wagon and pleaded for a frankfurter grudgingly i sold him one ruefully concluding that as always work was interfering at a crucial moment
2589260 i would solve a lot of literary problems just thinking about a character in the subway where you cant do anything anyway
2589261 my interest is in the future because i am going to spend the rest of my life there
2589262 the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
2589263 i am not afraid of tomorrow for i have seen yesterday and i love today
2589264 if you checked out google wannabe cuil you learned that
2589265 our counter thrust must be to prick holes in the stiff front erected by the russians leaders
2589266 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2589267 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2589268 i had low expectations of myself but my coach and teammates created ideal conditions for me to win
2589269 the russian track and field federation has made the decision that this athlete will not start in beijing
2589270 its like a dream i still cant believe ive just won the gold medal
2589271 i am pretty surprised i didnt think that id be first to get it not until the finals
2589272 getting that first race under your belt feels really good
2589273 one al qaida in iraq terrorist died when he detonated a vehicle borne bomb
2589274 all the georgian guys will be leaving for the homeland
2589275 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
2589276 the first couple days training here it was just kind of like whoa but today maybe the air was a little bit thinner it wasnt crazy bad for us
2589277 the conditions were just so humid and so hot it was just a real war of attrition today
2589278 will they be able to perform up to the level of their conditioning given the pollution its less about long term health risks thats not the issue
2589279 we tried very hard to work out in the worst part of the day and we stayed out there when it was hottest
2589280 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2589281 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2589282 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2589283 he was just so alive i cant believe hes gone
2589284 it was such a popular show because of his bigger than life persona
2589285 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2589286 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2589287 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2589288 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2589289 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2589290 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2589291 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2589292 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2589293 the wireless network appears to have been compromised and will be disabled for abo
2589294 they talk of democracy but they just want their hands on the power
2589295 but we couldnt let dictatorship return under the guise of democracy
2589296 we didnt really like abdallahi but he was democratically elected
2589297 whats the point of having a constitution if he can be forced out like that
2589298 the only issue that hit home is the war because of him
2589299 als wir zehn oder zw lf jahre alt waren haben wir uns vor einem turnier gemeinsam eingeschlagen
2589300 ich wollte ihn so beeindrucken dass ich mich m de gespielt habe und anschlie end mein match verlor seitdem will ich nicht mehr gegen ihn spielen
2589301 i didnt say it in an ugly tone of voice
2589302 as a kid with my mom and sister i played a board game i believe is called sink the titanic it was ruined in a flood from hurricane ivan a few years ago you rolled dice to move your game piece shaped like a porter from the ship but if a 1 or a 6 is rolled the ship is moved a notch counter clockwise until the rescue ship does surface
2589303 ik wil er niks mee doen echt niet maar ik moet gewoon kijken het is al een radar die signalen oppikt en die je niet af kunt zetten
2589304 ik besefte dat ik met mijn vrouw wilde trouwen op zon vakantie het duurde wel nog drie jaar eer ik zover was dat ik het durfde vragen maar intussen zijn we wel getrouwd en gelukkig
2589305 i asked him if he knew what he did and he said not really
2589306 we need to keep improving again that is the way this club is
2589307 it wasnt bad winning the double but if we dont keep winning the manager will definitely change things
2589308 i am sure he will have a few ideas in mind anyway the deadline is a few weeks away yet so we might have a new face or two
2589309 it is not just about footballing ability when you are spending such large sums of money you have to get everything right
2589310 it is about the personality and how they fit into the club he wants to be sure they will not upset things more often than not he gets it spot on
2589311 it will be interesting to see if they have a team
2589312 apparently half their players were on the toilet for a week
2589313 when we came back we still had to take malaria tablets for five or six days i hope they all did

2589335 we have unrealistic expectations for people john edwards like the rest of us is only human
2589336 the truth is a lot of ordinary average americans have affairs
2589337 the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2589338 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2589339 many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention
2589340 i think its entirely up to senator edwards and his wife and the rest of us should keep quiet
2589341 there are people who feel let down when you invest that much time and energy in a candidate and the candidate turns out to be less than you thought
2589342 the american public has become sensitised to this type of behaviour from political leaders
2589343 he should get off the political stage our staff put their faith and confidence in him and he let them down
2589344 awesome i know who i was when the first elizabeth was queen
2589345 why havent you spoken out on lionsgate and the midnight meat train dollar theater scandal
2589346 whats going on why havent i heard much from the skattsmen recently
2589347 ybf blabber discussion forums the housewives the topix rihanna daily understand news help celebrity
2589348 ive made it very clear that what i want is for families to make decisions about their health care not government
2589349 serious reform is needed to help american companies compete in international markets i have proposed a reduction in the corporate tax rate from the second highest in the world to one on par with our trading partners
2589350 i will propose a middle class tax cut a phase out of the alternative minimum tax to save more than 25 million middle class families as much as 2 000 in a single year
2589351 we shouldnt be distorting our tax code to benefit a few powerful interests we should be insisting that everyone pays their fair share and when im president they will
2589352 you have to go to the american people and say we wont raise your taxes we need personal savings accounts but we have got to fix this system
2589353 increase the amount workers making 250 000 or more pay into the system we will not privatize social security we will not raise the retirement age and we will save social security for future generations by asking the wealthiest americans to pay their fair share
2589354 sharply raising taxes on investment is a step in the wrong direction for the competitiveness of u s capital markets
2589355 weve lost the balance between work and wealth i will close the carried interest loophole and adjust the top dividends and capital gains rate
2589356 the effect of a gas tax holiday will be an immediate economic stimulus taking a few dollars off the price of a tank of gas every time a family a farmer or trucker stops to fill up
2589357 i realize that gimmicks like the gas tax holiday and offshore drilling might poll well these days but im not running for president to do what polls well
2589358 we will build a new system using the unemployment insurance taxes to build for each worker a buffer account against a sudden loss of income so that in times of need theyre not just told to fill out forms and take a number
2589359 we will provide incentives to businesses and consumers to save energy and make buildings more efficient thats how were going to create jobs that pay well and cant be outsourced
2589360 if we can get on a path of sustained growth if we can end the war in iraq end some of the special interest loopholes and earmarks that have been clogging up the system then i think we can return to a path of a balanced budget
2589361 were going to restrain spending were going to have the economy grow again and increase revenues
2589362 lenders and borrowers alike were caught up in the speculative frenzy that has harmed the housing market and it is not the responsibility of the american public to spare them from the consequences of their own bad judgment
2589363 we are excited to welcome students to our schools on monday
2589364 we are committed to student success to student involvement on campus and to working closely with parents our teachers are dedicated talented and eager to work with our families
2589365 not now im not ready we as a family arent ready
2589366 i love you we will be alright you can go now
2589367 they recognize that what we call something or someone affects how we treat them or react to the situation
2589368 but this merely shows that the nolans think people are stupid if the choices are that half the people die or everybody dies any rational person would decide to blow up the other boat
2589369 ive been told not to kill people so i will refuse to kill anyone and in doing so permit many more to die
2589370 but this merely shows that the nolans think people are stupid
2589371 ci si ritrova a guardarsi come piccoli punti di una trama intrecciata in modi a volte davvero imprevedibili
2589372 is acknowledging the screw up the same as admitting that you have failed as a company
2589373 i would feel ashamed if i just designed something for glamour or to show some kind of fake image
2589374 those people are such opportunists and they just become part of the powerful manipulators because they have no self consciousness and have such bad taste
2589375 i knew it would happen give women the vote and what do you get lady scientists
2589376 look how stupidly sexist it used to be the 1950s
2589377 for best results in science wear short shorts and be sure your deep intellect is matched by deep cleavage
2589378 we have to make a choice in a lot of cases great women or great science sometimes we get both but thats rare
2589379 dont worry about paying them castro will come through with the dough
2589380 were going to take grenada if we take it from the brits it could start world war three with one of our allies so instead were setting up your man bishop to stage a coup and then we can invade if it looks like hes in cahoots with the commies all the easier to do so
2589381 it feels like we havent slowed down since school started
2589382 if only one parent was a us citizen at the time of your birth that parent must have resided in the united states for at least ten years at least five of which had to be after the age of 16
2589383 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2589384 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2589385 that show that didnt make it big like sesame street
2589386 i never got free cereal but they gave me lots of green money
2589387 he says he is here on a family matter hes very insistent
2589388 the monitors display is coded by pigmentation ankarite on the left gatarrh on the right the central image illustrates the merger
2589389 mrs toguchi prayers are nice and its probably very helpful but you still need chemotherapy
2589390 dear lord youre the one who created my body so i know you can fix it
2589391 i put my whole faith in you father damien please pray for me too because i need your help
2589392 it may have delayed her eventual demise probably slow the cancer down but eventually she would have succumbed to this vicious cancer
2589393 the point here is that the primary tumor was treated
2589394 the bottom line is it probably does happen obviously it happens very rarely because it is the nature of cancer to grow not to regress
2589395 for the true believer or faithful this is a miracle for the true skeptic this is a random or very unusual coincidence for the doctor and scientist we call it complete spontaneous regression of cancer
2589396 im not the praying type but i just wanted to say thank you

2589504 it was mrs ts personality which attracted so many homosexual men to the party in a profession dominated by men with dandruff and hair coming out of their noses or women who appear to have been dragged through a hedge backwards a la shirley williams the pure elegance feminine perfection perfect dress sense and sheer determination to change society drew many gay men to the iron lady
2589505 we must do something about loony left councils promoting homosexuality in schools
2589506 yes why dont you work it into the local government bill
2589507 local authorities shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality

2589540 avevo la stessa et di joy quando mio nonno mi port a codola mi rimasta solo qualche immagine sfocata di quel giorno ma mi ricorda una persona molto cara alla quale non sono mai riuscito a dire quanto volevo bene
2589541 vede matteo lamore che i figli e i nipoti provano per i genitori o i nonni come il blu del mare quando ci sono un po di nuvole il mare perde il suo colore ma il cielo no cos si finisce per credere che tanti avvenimenti siano brutti e pesano come tronchi di legno ma col tempo sul mare dei ricordi quel legno cos bello e leggero
2589542 la prossima pompei joy dobbiamo scendere e stato un piacere poter parlare con lei matteo sembra una persona assennata i sentimenti sono ci che ci rendono unici e ci offrono il punto di vista da cui osserviamo il mondo manifestarli con sincerit agli altri ci che di pi bello possiamo donare cerchi di tenerlo sempre presente

2589557 gli ex voto da alcuni sono considerati oggetti rituali quasi pagani a me piace pensare che attraverso questi oggetti la gioia di una persona pu servire per illuminare il cuore di tante altre il destino di una persona collegato in maniera inesplicabile a quello di tante altre ci che dio ci chiede di manifestare sempre agli altri i nostri sentimenti

2589565 el hablar actual sobre dios tiende a alejarse del compromiso con los dogmas o ritos de las religiones establecidas la invocaci n a dios es quiz ansia de una fuerza que d sentido a la propia vida claro que la aproximaci n a lo divino sigue estando mediada por las grandes religiones monote stas y por el creciente evangelismo y otros cultos como hare krishna budismo yoga o cultos populares como el del gauchito gil pero ahora las v as tradicionales y colectivas de la religi n conviven con la aparici n de un sujeto que puede ser receptivo a varias creencias religiosas pero sin perder por esto su independencia su no pertenencia formal a ning n culto en particular
2589566 si los profetas abraham isaac jacob ismael jos o jesucristo la paz est con l estuvieran hoy entre nosotros c mo juzgar an tales conductas
2589567 me han dicho que su excelencia sigue las ense anzas de jes s la paz est con l y que cree en la promesa divina de un reinado de los justos en la tierra
2589568 seg n vers culos divinos todos estamos llamados a adorar a un dios y a seguir las ense anzas de los profetas divinos
2589569 el liberalismo y la democracia de corte occidental no han podido contribuir a la realizaci n de los ideales de la humanidad
2589570 nos guste o no el mundo gravita hacia la fe en el todopoderoso y la justicia y la voluntad de dios prevalecer n sobre todas las cosas
2589571 el fin de las ideolog as de los grandes discursos pol ticos y ticos dej a los hombres desamparados y stos se refugian en un cielo que permite todos los delirios para hacer la vida m s vivible argumenta no satisfecho con la prohibici n de comer el fruto prohibido dios no ces de manifestarse mediante interdicciones las religiones monote stas no viven sino de prescripciones y de exhortaciones hacer y no hacer decir y no decir pensar y no pensar prohibido y autorizado l cito e il cito los textos religiosos abundan en codificaciones existenciales alimentarias de comportamiento rituales etc tera
2589572 la religi n surge de la necesidad de dar sentido a la realidad de escapar al caos que significa el sinsentido el hombre desde un principio no dej de experimentar una fractura que hab a despedazado su integridad algo andaba mal se necesitaba una recomposici n para que el caos no terminara de arrojarlo al sinsentido surge entonces una actividad esencialmente simb lica destinada a otorgar sentido al grupo etnia tribu o pueblo y en consecuencia al individuo es la religi n
2589573 dios no est muerto ni agonizante al contrario de lo que pensaba nietzsche porque no es mortal las ficciones no mueren las ilusiones tampoco un cuento para ni os no se puede refutar ni el hipogrifo ni el centauro est n sometidos a la ley de los mam feros un pavo real un caballo s un animal del bestiario mitol gico no ahora bien dios proviene del bestiario mitol gico como miles de otras criaturas que aparecen en los diccionarios en innumerables entradas entre d meter y discordia as pues dios durar tanto como las razones que lo hacen existir sus negadores tambi n parece un inmortal
2589574 la religi n dijo sus ltimas palabras inteligibles nobles o inspiradoras hace mucho tiempo a partir de ese momento se convirti en un humanismo admirable pero nebuloso igual que le pas por ejemplo a dietrich bonhoeffer un valiente pastor luterano ahorcado por los nazis por negarse a actuar en connivencia con ellos no habr m s profetas ni sabios de antiguo cu o lo cual es la raz n por la que las devociones de hoy en d a son nicamente ecos de repeticiones del ayer a veces elaboradas hasta el hilarante extremo de conjurar una terrible vacuidad
2589575 ya fuera para responder al desaf o de la ciencia moderna ya para sentar las bases desde las cuales predicar el cristianismo a mundos y culturas remotas lo cierto es que la iglesia fue desarrollando de modo progresivo toda una doctrina de los preambula fidei en relaci n cada vez m s estrecha con una metaf sica de tipo objetivista
2589576 coincido con hume y con kant en que el concepto de prueba emp rica es irrelevante a la hora de hablar de dios pero este punto sirve por igual contra el ate smo y el te smo el presidente bush ha aportado un buen argumento cuando dijo en un discurso destinado a complacer a los fundamentalistas cristianos que el ate smo es una fe pues no puede confirmarse ni refutarse mediante argumentos o pruebas pero lo mismo puede aplicarse desde luego al te smo ni los que afirman ni los que niegan la existencia de dios pueden reclamar de forma plausible tener pruebas de su parte ser religioso en el occidente moderno no tiene mucho que ver con la explicaci n de fen menos espec ficamente observables
2589577 el renacimiento de la religi n en el tercer milenio no viene motivado tanto por las amenazas globales el terrorismo o la cat strofe ecol gica planetaria como por la muerte de dios por la secularizaci n de lo sagrado que ha estado en el centro del proceso a trav s del cual se ha desarrollado la civilizaci n del mundo occidental
2589578 hay nuevos relatos que ponen en juego soluciones imaginarias creencias m gicas cosas que son semejantes a los mitos simples supersticiones relatos vinculados a mentalidades primitivas que aparecen junto a la religi n tradicional
2589579 en oriente y occidente la humanidad acosada por el mpetu tecnol gico las guerras la discutible muerte de dios la falta de cielos protectores el exceso de desencantos y los fracasos de las utop as recurre al di logo de caracter sticas religiosas
2589580 la cuesti n de la p rdida es una construcci n de nuestra sociedad porque en realidad lo sagrado es ahist rico la p rdida es relativa depende de qui n lo enuncia el mundo de lo sagrado es din mico y cambiante a lo largo del tiempo en todo caso la diferencia es que ahora hay conciencia de lo sagrado
2589581 si dios cre el mundo fue por temor de la soledad sa es la nica explicaci n de la creaci n
2589582 georgian authorities actions in south ossetia are of course a crime and primarily a crime against its own people
2589583 by delivering a strike on georgias territorial integrity and thus by causing damage to its statehood its difficult to imagine how its possible to convince south ossetia to be part of georgia after the events which happened and continue to happen
2589584 the aggression led to numerous victims including among the peaceful population and provoked a real humanitarian catastrophe
2589585 and this is of course a crime against its own people
2589586 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2589587 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2589588 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2589589 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2589590 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2589591 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2589592 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2589593 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2589615 subvention agencies not returning the unspent portions of amounts paid over to them for specific expenditure
2589616 several ministries and regions have not recovered amounts overpaid on various contracts in prior periods in addition some of these ministries and regions such as education amerindian affairs regions two three six seven and ten continued to have overpayments on various contracts during 2006 one such example was recorded under the ministry of education where 10 982m was overpaid on eleven projects which were mainly for the rehabilitation and extension to schools

2589627 when john edwards admitted friday that he lied about his affair with filmmaker rielle hunter a former employee of his campaign he may have ended his public life but he certainly ratified an end to the era in which traditional media set the agenda for national political journalism with that admission the illusion that traditional print and broadcast news organizations can establish the limits of acceptable political journalism joined the passenger pigeon on the roster of extinct americana

2589630 i know our program manager is ranking captains on landing with less fuel i dont care to be ranked i think this is a safety problem and i believe fuel is your friend
2589631 looking back i would have liked more gas yesterday and i was already carrying tanker fuel if i wouldnt have had this extra there would have been real problems
2589632 far below my comfort zone and probably less than the minimum fuel required by the fars federal aviation regulations
2589633 our fuel situation had not become critical yet but had we had any delay i would have had to declare a fuel emergency
2589634 i am not sure if the flight plan as given to me by my company was a real flight plan or if they were just telling me it was so that i would continue to jfk thus saving them time and expense in the future if such a situation presents itself again i will divert to my initial destination regardless of what my company says i can do the safety of my crew far outweighs any financial burden to the company

2589691 we definitely didnt start off the way we wanted to but everything is not going to go your way and things are going to happen and its how you respond we came out of the timeout and responded immediately didnt waste any time at all at this stage of the game i think we have 10 days in together those kinds of things really please the coach to see that theyre still responsive theyre making adjustments on the fly
2589692 czech republic came out really strong and kind of dictated both sides of the ball
2589693 when they do that theyre a very tough team coach donovan called timeout kinda refocused on what we need to do and i think we did a good job of responding and coming back holding strong in that first quarter then building from there i think if anything the strength of today was how deep we are bringing people off the bench contributing changing the game the pace of it we just have to build from this just one game but good feelings from this game
2589694 weve been working on our defense and obviously 27 turnovers kind of reflected that that we forced

2589716 with that word all the other ones sank and so many people died in there
2589717 no we cannot break it we have to go straight and hit this mountain the way this ship is built it will go it will break through or it will stop but if we go sideways then we are in danger
2589718 those squareheads didnt accept the captain and at the last minute they turned the rudder of the ship to the other side right underneath on the bottom part the ice became like a sharp object and it cut the whole side of the ship at the bottom and then the water started rising when the water started coming in they were still arrogant up there they were playing dancing gambling and when the word reached to them they said shut down the first floor with the people in it let them drown because those are the third class people there that we have they closed all the doors and they let all those people suffer in there
2589719 allahs anger was with them the water was rising and rising and it sank everything in it most of the arrogant ones there at that time died or they died with different incidents after their lifetime and up till now for eighty five years the anger of allah was with them
2589720 grandsheykh is saying that every night up till tonight they were going through the same punishment same thing was happening to them every night for eighty five years grandsheykhs blessings reached to them he made me to stay up all night long to pray for them and that lifted it away from them

2589798 however subsequent developments in the law call this conclusion into question although the legislature did not amend the statutory scheme so as to expressly permit home schooling more recent enactments demonstrate an apparent acceptance by the legislature of the proposition that home schooling is taking place in california with home schools allowed as private schools recent statutes indicate that the legislature is aware that some parents in california home school their children by declaring their homes to be private schools moreover several statutory enactments indicate a legislative approval of home schooling by exempting home schools from requirements otherwise applicable to private schools

2589835 to me that was a strong indication of her love she is a fabulous person
2589836 i can only offer the deepest shock and sorrow we all feel here because the bachman family was always so close to our program
2589837 they still came back to support her former high school teams
2589838 it was just a great great couple supporting the programs and supporting the school
2589839 he never wanted to be above anybody their comments were always positive it never appeared to me in all these years ive known him that he was above anybody else i never got that kind of impression they were great human beings
2589840 todd was ultimately kind he was just so incredibly supportive as a father of an athlete some people can get a little worked up at sporting events but he was just there in the stands waving his flag whether it was for team usa for ucla or for lakeville
2589841 we played some very good teams and some very good players indiana is like four or five hours away and thats the farthest ive ever been from home
2589842 the teams were really good but we just played good defense and won all the games

2589844 if buddha nature has all the marks and signs how is it different from the soul or atman of non buddhists

2589846 i just hope at the end of the season i feel like i made the right decision
2589847 i like to do things in formats that my players are familiar with
2589848 the orbit of steins with which rosetta will rendezvous on 5 september closing to a distance of 800 km is only known thanks to ground observations but not yet with the accuracy we would like for the close fly by
2589849 we will be able to use the first data set for the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned for mid august
2589850 for the first three weeks of the campaign however only the powerful eyes of osiris will actually be able to spot the asteroid which will look only like a dot in the sky
2589851 starting 11 days before closest approach as the distance with steins decreases the two rosetta navigation cameras will finally be able to see and track the asteroid too
2589852 we will already be able to use the first data set for the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned for mid august
2589853 as rosettas distance from steins decreases the precision of the measurements for steins orbit will increase even further allowing us the best possible trajectory corrections later on before closest approach especially in early september
2589854 but osiris will also take this opportunity to obtain light curves of steins light curves tell us how the asteroid brightness varies with time providing us with additional preparatory information about the asteroid such as better knowledge of its shape and rotation characteristics
2589855 liberals are so stupid this post at the national review proves why
2589856 i was empty at the end just in terms of fuel i just havent had seven hour rides
2589857 the guy that i raced today wasnt the guy who won the tours so i dont put myself in that category
2589858 but it was great of him to come out and do this race and to race with all the people hes a class act out there it was fun we didnt talk a whole lot because it seemed like it was pretty much business
2589859 at the end i realized i was thoroughly cooked but i said i am having a good time
2589860 thats why i wanted to come out here i didnt expect to beat this guy so i just wanted have something out there to shoot for train for stay in shape for and it was a blast it really was
2589861 i wont come back unless im in shape and i feel like im in decent shape you cant show up to this race if youre not in shape so it just depends on how i train id love to be back
2589862 i dont know what happened its got to be flattened by now it was squishing all over
2589863 that was a product of lance and i being together
2589864 it was lances idea i would have never considered that
2589865 i have 10 minutes of free time i think ill make a costume

2589868 i was more bored than you when i wrote this and now youre reading it
2589869 what those transfer rumors really mean rumor freddie ljungberg yes the underwear model to the galaxy
2589870 i told him embrace the olympics dont let the olympics embrace you
2589871 that means go and experience it go and find out for yourself
2589872 hes having a ball and hes not overawed at all you cant get him out of the games room because there are so many choices hes on the wii and theres certainly some noise coming out of the tv room
2589873 the beauty of tom is that he is so focused on his diving hes here to learn hes here to get experience but were fully aware that if he and blake dive really well they are in with a chance theres no question about that
2589874 if one of them makes a mistake it could be game over
2589875 the thing that makes tom and the great ones so great is that they just seem to be born with it
2589876 when he was in junior teams he became homesick he missed his parents and he would cry at night
2589877 he was a bit of a mess at the time in the junior teams there was a 9 30 curfew at night but when
2589878 hes enjoying being treated like an adult at the end of the day he knows what hes got to do is to dive well but if that means staying up late playing games thats fine
2589879 its better than being forced to go to bed at 9 30 and not being able to sleep for four hours
2589880 tom was in the green room with kobe bryant and lebron james and tom looked the size of a basketball next to them
2589881 he stood up on stage and admitted that wrestling was fixed
2589882 the driver states that he had a little problem with the steering he left the roadway when he left the roadway he panicked a little bit overcorrected which brought him back into the lane of travel as he was crossing the center line he realized there was another car so he overcorrected again and thats when he struck the jersey barrier from there he rode the jersey barrier a little bit and rolled up against the guardrail here as you can see busting up the guardrail and thats what caused the truck to tip over spilling its cargo everywhere
2589883 once you become a mother you stop being the picture and you become the frame
2589884 i felt it in my first at bat and it got worse
2589885 he started in chicago and really did it the old fashioned way where you do your time and work in the clubs and you develop a following even when they did
2589886 he was one of those comics that was unique because of his approach his look his voice the content of his material and the fact that he was a father who was a little rougher on the kids but you understood because of that background i know a lot of us have had
2589887 at 50 years old he will be sorely missed and to be such a good father to your kids and to be a great husband and not be around is really difficult for everybody as comics we are all brothers and ill miss him a lot he was a good friend of mine
2589888 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2589889 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2589890 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2589891 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2589892 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2589893 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2589894 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2589895 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2589896 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2589897 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2589898 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2589899 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2589900 kasatochi went from a quiet volcano to an explosive eruption within 24 hours and with very little warning
2589901 we are thankful our colleagues were able to get out before the eruption began they were rescued just in time by a local fishing boat
2589902 fortunately the existing seismic networks on nearby volcanoes picked up the activity at kasatochi volcano
2589903 they were installed with funding from the federal aviation administration to reduce the hazard to aviation from volcanic ash these networks were crucial in recognizing that this volcano had entered the first stage of a major eruption
2589904 our hope is to have monitoring equipment on all volcanoes that pose the greatest threats to public safety
2589905 satellite imagery is useful to see the big picture of what is happening and what is going into the atmosphere but direct instrumentation such as placing seismic monitors around a volcano will help give an early warning and give people more time to plan for hazardous events
2589906 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2589907 this is an area of concern for us and we are looking to getting people on the ground quickly
2589908 the un is working quite closely with the government of northern bar el ghazal which has set up a crisis management committee

2589917 going to a grocery store may never be the same
2589918 maybe thats why no other state in the country bans bpa
2589919 this is toxic to the political process its fine to oppose but you have to tell the truth
2589920 we do believe that the bill could potentially affect a wide range of products
2589921 and it could extend quite a bit beyond that to containers and serving dishes anything used to feed a child
2589922 although our review of the ntp national toxicology program reports is continuing a large body of available evidence indicates that food contact materials containing bpa currently on the market are safe and that exposure levels to bpa from these materials including exposure to infants and children are below those that may cause health effects
2589923 if youre going to replace them you have to find something that works and thats not so easy because you have a wide range of food types and cans
2589924 there really is potential for products to leave the shelf there is no good alternative right now not that will work across the board
2589925 this kind of stuff just drives people in science crazy

2589928 it is now time for the states to give up the powers that theyve had and taken advantage of over the past 50 odd years and give the powers to the commonwealth to ensure that we can have a truly independent body making the decisions in the best interest of the river
2589929 when states can be given as they have the right of veto to any of the proposals or plans put forward by the current authority its a furphy to say that it is independent
2589930 were in a black hole at the moment as far as research goes but it is hard to imagine a world in the future where these technologies are not deployed more widely
2589931 we need to get the evidence to see if these things can be deployed on a wide scale
2589932 the extreme environmentalists are preventing us from collecting the evidence we have to go public and try to move the public debate forward we know what the consequences will be but we need that debate
2589933 we have major concerns we have no idea what the interaction with wild trees could be there could be unforeseen consequences
2589934 there is a growing global movement for a complete moratorium on gm trees because of their ecological impact these trees could cross pollinate with wild trees over great distances if traits are passed on to native trees it can have a significant negative impact on biodiversity
2589935 gm trees are a very bad idea for a lot of reasons if these trees are released into the environment then contamination is inevitable we do not support any trials because there is no guarantee against escapes of the genetically modified traits
2589936 the real tragedy of the attacks on the field trials were that they actually prevented us accumulating the knowledge of just how useful they could be i cant see any justification for interfering with field trials
2589937 the whole area has had such a bad press that it would be a real bonus to find an example where they could show a conservation benefit to make people stop and think again that it could be beneficial rather than the entrenched positions almost knee jerk responses that some of the conservation groups have come out with
2589938 in other parts of the world people really are pursuing it much more actively than we are at the moment if these trees do offer benefits we will be left behind
2589939 we are always open minded and if there were a potentially significant gm breakthrough which for example would allow a reduction in pesticide use or would tackle a challenge thrown up by climate change such as from new pests and diseases then we would consider it within the context of sustainable forest management with partners in the environmental sector and in government
