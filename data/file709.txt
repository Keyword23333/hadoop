7090003 chelsea have agreed terms for andriy shevchenko to return to ac milan details of the agreement will remain confidential
7090004 after a series of frenetic phone calls during the whole day we reached an agreement with chelsea tomorrow he will be in milan monday he will undergo a medical and then sign a contract
7090005 we have managed to bring home a player who has scored the most goals in our shirt in the last 50 years
7090006 i think obama can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7090007 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden

7090011 he would also agree with us intentions to set up a naval base in sabah i obtained all this information from very reliable sources
7090012 we would like to know how anwar is obtaining huge funds for his by election campaign
7090013 he may not be a threat to the u s but he is to the people hes allegedly been attacking
7090014 has not been in great health hes being treated for a number of medical issues that one would expect in an elderly male who hasnt exactly had a tranquil life
7090015 i worry that these cases have the tendency to make very bad law

7090017 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7090018 i slept through the whole thing it wasnt very dramatic when it came onshore
7090019 i just think were so fortunate we didnt have high tide and a stronger wind because hurricane dennis is still fresh in our mind the tidal surge we had in here
7090020 i offered to pay for that one sign if they would agree to use gender neutral ones
7090021 the head of the work crew said he had gender neutral signs but refused to use them no charges were filed
7090022 signs such as men at work unintentionally reinforce the idea that only men are suited for and are capable of doing outdoor physical jobs
7090023 the response is weve seen none of those signs theyre not out there
7090024 my guess is that atlanta probably bought a bunch of signs back in the late 70s early 80s and maybe werent aware of the change
7090025 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc
7090026 an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
7090027 there are many possible methods to determine age but they are not very accurate the error is about two years
7090028 we all age at different rates at the molecular level
7090029 but then it made a turn as if the wing dropped abruptly
7090030 we were still very low very close to the ground
7090031 and then the wind shifted and i felt how the smoke was burning me
7090032 can you find out where the broadcasts are coming from
7090033 the next shock is going to be bigger and bigger still
7090034 the shocks keep getting bigger because we keep propping things up and bailing everyone out
7090035 you cant reject your bronze medal youre stripped of it
7090036 i could have gone my whole life and such a concept would have never occurred to me
7090037 i studied it in depth for three months before making a complete paradigm shift from a saturday sabbath to what i call the lunisolar creation sabbath
7090038 it was at a hebrew style wedding the bride to be mentioned that saturday was no longer her sabbath but that her sabbath for that month of july 2007 was actually on tuesday
7090039 its total bunk these woman dont know anything from whence they speak
7090040 the bible says on the seventh day god rested and hallowed it that was from the creation of the world i dont know how much clearer you can get the weekly sabbath has nothing to do with the lunar or solar year it never has not even until this day jesus followed the same seventh day that jews and saturday observant christians follow today
7090041 the origin of the jewish calendar can no longer be accurately traced
7090042 the seventh day of the week the day of rest
7090043 the new moon is still and the sabbath originally was dependent upon the lunar cycle
7090044 regardless of what jews have done or not done in history nowhere in gods word does proof exist that the new moons are to be regarded as holy sabbath convocations for corporate worship whatever jews may have done in history is irrelevant in determining whether the new moons are sabbaths we must obey the word not history
7090045 the offer was to anyone who could give one bible verse showing that god commands us to keep holy the first day of the week sunday instead of the seventh day saturday
7090046 so i read the letter that you received looking for the required bible verse i couldnt find it why not because its not there
7090047 both ministers and people have responded seeking to show the desired change of gods holy sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week they say many nice things but scripture proof is always lacking
7090048 any society that tried to carry on their schools church or business without a continuous weekly cycle would be in utter chaos the poor people would get so confused that they wouldnt know what to do
7090049 the challenge will continue but society is now in such a state that i will ask for people to use either the authorized king james version of the bible or the new king james version lest someone try to get the money by writing a book with the desired statement in it and call their book the bible
7090050 no one has ever even tried to find out how many there are as the focus has always been on the truth itself rather than how many adhere to that truth
7090051 you cant reject your bronze medal youre stripped of it
7090052 ma ma wheres my pa gone to the white house ha ha ha
7090053 i think every single candidate for president republican and democratic have lives personal lives that indicate something about what kind of human being they are and i think it is a fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make
7090054 what state does this business that has been using shredded checks as packing material for 20 plus year operate out of with blissful ignorance
7090055 guarda vale ma quelli sono ma s dai quegli uccelli che stanno su una zampa sola i fenicotteri
7090056 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time

7090073 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7090074 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7090075 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7090076 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7090077 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7090078 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7090079 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7090080 i have carefully avoided situations that might even tangentially be construed as a less than proper use of my office
7090081 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7090082 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7090083 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7090084 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

7090087 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7090088 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

7090091 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7090092 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7090093 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7090094 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7090095 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7090096 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7090097 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7090098 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7090099 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7090100 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7090101 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7090102 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7090103 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7090104 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7090105 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7090106 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7090107 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7090108 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7090109 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7090110 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7090111 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7090112 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7090113 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7090114 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7090115 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7090116 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7090117 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7090118 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7090119 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7090120 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7090121 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7090122 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7090123 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7090124 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7090125 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7090126 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7090127 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7090128 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7090129 biden conhecido como charlat o por sua tend ncia de fazer declara es que o metem numa sinuca de bico
7090130 obama ainda n o estava pronto para a presid ncia
7090131 a escolha de biden enfatiza certas fragilidades que a campanha de obama visa a corrigir num momento em que as pesquisas mostram que sua competi o com o senador republicano john mccain se torna mais disputada
7090132 para uma campanha que se orgulha de sua disciplina em termos de comunica o a op o por biden incorpora equipe um forte elemento fuerte de incerteza
7090133 excelente orador mas criticado como verborr gico e que no geral se v prejudicado por suas pr prias declara es
7090134 biden passou a sexta feira em casa com a fam lia e amigos o senador habitualmente loquaz assumiu uma postura discreta
7090135 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7090136 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7090137 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7090138 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7090139 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7090140 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7090141 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7090142 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7090143 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7090144 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7090145 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7090146 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

7090160 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7090161 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7090162 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7090163 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7090164 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7090165 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7090166 they are not seen as cool apple is cool can anyone even recall a microsoft ad no
7090167 in the weeks ahead well launch a campaign to address any lingering doubts our customers may have about windows vista
7090168 this still wont solve microsofts real problem which is that its monopoly is eroding and even seinfeld wont be able to change that
7090169 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
7090170 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
7090171 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
7090172 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
7090173 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
7090174 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
7090175 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
7090176 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
7090177 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
7090178 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
7090179 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
7090180 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence
7090181 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
7090182 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
7090183 they say this other guy is unpatriotic or this guy likes french people thats what they said about kerry
7090184 they try to make it out like democrats arent tough enough arent macho enough its the same strategy
7090185 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment and they do have profound differences of opinion on the best way to reduce our dependence on mideast oil bring jobs back to america and keep our nation safe

7090209 i slept through the whole thing it wasnt very dramatic when it came onshore

7090223 strong leader fierce advocate and devoted family man with values rooted in the best of what american stands for
7090224 joe biden has been fighting his entire career for the change that senator obama champions
7090225 a sage voice on many of the toughest foreign policy issues of our time and has long been a strong advocate for protecting american families and making our communities safer
7090226 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7090227 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7090228 i just think were not getting into the details of the tick tock
7090229 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7090230 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
7090231 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
7090232 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7090233 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
7090234 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7090235 in 1966 while in law school biden married neilia hunter
7090236 time for the hillary women to make a wise choice and show disdain to the obama biden ticket that just expects all of the hillary women to fold and come through for them the all male ticket that defeated the historic quest of hillary clinton
7090237 the poll conducted august 15 20 with 370 democratic voters
7090238 be our guest at tc50 contest is now open and runs through midnight sunday august 31st read the full contest rules
7090239 the lord is high yet he looks on the lowly
7090240 sometime between now and the end of next month apples going to be refreshing quite a bit of their ipod line
7090241 thats the kind of way we were used to playing last year that was something we needed to see
7090242 that gives us a little confidence with the season around the corner
7090243 i tried to bait the guy a little bit but he did a great job and got underneath the ball
7090244 it was nice to see him regroup after the interception
7090245 to come out of the two minute situation with points is a positive that gave us a shot in the arm
7090246 we could have done a ton more we didnt go that deep in the playbook as long as we get into the rhythm and feel good about each other and what were doing the skys the limit
7090247 well probably start looking at cleveland probably more in depth now and start preparing for them
7090248 everything offensively went well passing game the run game just the way we moved the ball down the field
7090249 the catholic church the priests the religious members of religious orders and the faithful ordinary catholics are very faithful to the roman catholic church and are very faithful to the pope
7090250 in fact in china i would say the chinese catholic church is the most faithful to the church and to the pope benedict
7090251 this is the day of our god so i come here i like the atmosphere it is very lovely
7090252 as a student i have a lot of stress and i feel very depressed sometimes
7090253 but when i come to the church i feel very happy
7090254 nous voulions gagner nous ramenons un point m rit car nous avons jou dix seulement pendant plus dune heure nous prendrons les trois points dimanche prochain
7090255 its been really rewarding for us to see him outside like this and so healthy were proud of the progress hes made
7090256 when he first came to us he was very thin for his length
7090257 weve estimated hes about 3 or 4 years old but its hard to tell since his growth rate was altered by his limited environment and poor nutrition
7090258 he was so weak when he got here he could barely take two steps his muscles had atrophied pretty badly and he was frightened he had never been in sunshine and grass before and he just stayed huddled up against the wall behind the tortoise exhibit it took a good two months to get him strong enough that we felt he could go outside and walk through the grass like this
7090259 not only could such an animal pose a danger but most people dont have the resources to keep an animal like this the proper environment or food
7090260 they have no idea how to care for it the animal grows bigger than they expected and then ends up in a bad situation or let loose which poses other problems
7090261 we had to get two catch poles to put around the neck and tail
7090262 he was scared so it wasnt an easy task then we were able to get him in one of the cages in the animal control van and we brought him to the zoo
7090263 there really arent that many places around here to rehab an alligator
7090264 its like taking a person out of new york city and throwing him in the rain forest
7090265 he wouldnt know sources of food or how to survive
7090266 it appears as though they had a platonic relationship that went back 20 years
7090267 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7090268 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7090269 the best possible pick that barack obama could have made
7090270 i think he brings a wealth of experience and he is a great campaigner and i think he is a very fine pick
7090271 joe biden has been fighting his entire career for the change that sen obama champions
7090272 he is a dedicated family man who has been an effective chairman of both the foreign affairs and judiciary committees has been a sage voice on many of the toughest foreign policy issues of our time and has long been a strong advocate for protecting american families and making our communities safer
7090273 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7090274 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7090275 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7090276 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7090277 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7090278 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7090279 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7090280 much like gary hart hes identified more with the partys presidential past than its present or future
7090281 he was after all forced out by a mini scandal which would come up again
7090282 it does appear that without my knowledge the dlc listed me in their new democrat directory
7090283 because i agree that such a directory implies membership i will be calling the dlc to have my name removed and appreciate your having brought this fact to my attention
7090284 its warm its noisy and its pungent in there and the bats are flying all around you its really really cool
7090285 its something to do and its fun yeah its dirty work
7090286 no podr n articularse medidas expulsivas de los asentamientos humanos existentes en tierras fiscales a la fecha de promulgaci n de la presente y durante su vigencia
7090287 en arag n sta es una de las que m s me gusta suelo ir a muchas aunque de este tipo no sobran
7090288 es lo que m s gusta pero las arom ticas es el plato principal
7090289 tenemos las m s resistentes las de la zona porque tanto navarra como arag n se llevan muy poco pero el tomillo el romero la lavanda y la albahaca son las que mejor se venden las m s famosas
7090290 tenemos laureles mentas mejoranas hierbaluisas melisas que tambi n gustan
7090291 adem s de arom ticas sirven de condimento y son medicinales
7090292 aparte de ser bonitas tienen usos para la cocina hacer infusiones y quien quiera medicinales
7090293 son muy resistentes y ahuyentan plagas porque ahuyentan mosquitos pulgones
7090294 es una alegr a que el largometraje que gane es adem s la pera prima de un director aragon s
7090295 el certamen de largometrajes ha sido constante con lleno casi absoluto todas las noches yo creo que es una evoluci n natural de esta secci n que empez t midamente el segundo a o con tres largometrajes que no iban ni a concurso

7090299 approx 40 million american adults ages 18 and older or about 18 1 percent of people in this age group in a given year have an anxiety disorder
7090300 with the team i put out i would have taken that before hand it was a deserved win in the end for us
7090301 he completely turned the game made all the difference the boy has played no football after training yesterday i felt there was no choice but to take him although i felt he wasnt ready hes probably won us the game if we get some new players hopefully well have a good squad at the moment we have very little to choose from
7090302 i think its a goal he jumps well i dont see hands on shoulders for me its a goal its lifted us all we hadnt played well after the first half but i thought the second half we improved and to score a couple of goals away from is not easy
7090303 i am sure the names that have been mooted in the press are the players we are very close to
7090304 more information has been brought to light and brought to our attention so we decided to go to the federation and have them look into it further
7090305 we had been given some more information and thought that this information was concerning enough to go to the chinese gymnastic federation and have a thorough discussion about it
7090306 ich bin sauer dass wir unsere m glichkeiten nicht genutzt haben und den lohn f r unsere leistung nicht bekommen haben
7090307 wir haben schon in bielefeld zweimal eine f hrung nicht halten k nnen daran m ssen wir arbeiten aber wir sind schon einen schritt weiter

7090315 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee watch the first obama biden rally live at 3pm et on http www barackobama com spread the word
7090316 its about time that they leave politics and align themselves to god let the politicians do their jobs while the ministers concentrate on the flock
7090317 we need to change the culture of how we are dealing with issues we have to relook ourselves whether is it worth going to church
7090318 this is the heart of the problem because kava is the food for the devil
7090319 there is an increase in unwanted pregnancies and there other issues which affect the families
7090320 we need to begin from home and see that we live according to the principle of the bible
7090321 a total of 43 choirs of the class one category participated throughout the day and once we announced the winner we should know the correct overall amount
7090322 i was already on my way to the airport for my reporting time at 12 15pm when they called at 11 45am to tell me about the cancellation
7090323 but they told me to come to the airport anyway because there could just be a last flight available
7090324 i arrived in labasa three weeks ago for a holiday and have already booked my flight to sydney tomorrow today
7090325 they were like horses they just came out of the bushes and took off again
7090326 there was no time to react like a flash they were gone
7090327 i had just gotten out of the car when they came out of the bushes they were masked and armed with cane knives
7090328 the workers were so shocked that by the time they realised what was happening the robbers had disappeared
7090329 theyre not saying anything to the pilots but weve been told to be on standby tomorrow today
7090330 the church stand has not changed and will never change come what may
7090331 the church believes that the coup is unscriptural unbiblical and ungodly
7090332 the charter is an illegal document which was born from this illegal government
7090333 im speaking as a man of god and i want to be heard as a prophetic voice of this nation
7090334 anything by this government which i believe is illegal i will not support it
7090335 if they do come i will tell my members to say no
7090336 donation should be coming from the heart and im glad that im doing it for a worthy cause
7090337 i stayed in toorak for the last 40 years and i count myself lucky to be associated with one of the oldest church in fiji
7090338 i dont expect any favour in return but only god knows i have made good friends and i want to maintain that relationship in years to come
7090339 he sent two police officers to my home to ask me if i could come down to his office at government buildings to discuss the matter and i agreed
7090340 we had a short chat and i agreed to give him the details of what he wants on monday the officers then drove me back home
7090341 unfortunate and unreasonable and its a violation of fundamental human rights
7090342 there has been a coup and many have condemned it while some of us are part of the charter process and weve looked at the freedom of the media and the responsibility of the media
7090343 we should not be making sweeping statements that we have nothing to lose this is a club based on shared values
7090344 youre better off being one of 16 than being alone the forum co ordinates action and is the pacific voice on matters of common interest
7090345 we didnt expect the win but we are very glad that we pulled through there was tough competition especially from bank of baroda and other big companies who were sponsors so it was all known when they finally announced the names
7090346 we had worked hard and we will also be putting a request in our submission on where should some of the funds be allocated because we know some organisations who genuinely need it
7090347 he is the one who has been silently supporting me all the while making breakfast and dinner for the family i also thank my family and workmates who were always there to encourage me my old father didnt mind making me coffee at 6am every morning and my pregnant sister didnt mind doing my makeup anytime i had requested her to do it without all this support i wouldnt be here
7090348 somehow his lack of experience ultra liberal record elitist attitudes and sinister political connections never enter into the equation
7090349 sterling planet welcomes the opportunity to supply renewable energy to the pepsi center in support of the dnc
7090350 this clean energy both mitigates the climate change impact of the event and demonstrates how renewable energy is an important component of the new energy economy in colorado and throughout the nation
7090351 we are a proud partner with sterling planet in supporting kroenke sports enterprises and the dnc vision for a green convention
7090352 we commend sterling planet for generously providing renewable energy to support our programs to offset the carbon footprint resulting from the dnc s presence at the pepsi center
7090353 bided my time until about halfway and then caught up a fair bit then when i wanted to really get going about 100m out i got jelly arms again
7090354 i dont know what happened at the start maybe i did have a bit of the edge taken off me yesterday but i felt good in the warm up and good at the start i just dont know
7090355 i guess i could have qualified the k1 500m later and just done that
7090356 but this is my first olympics in kayaking its a big learning curve for me and i got into a k1 final and i gave it everything i had youve got to be happy with that we were also sixth in the world in the k2 1000m and thats phenomenal
7090357 i can go away now and work on it and i know what i have to work on to beat these guys
7090358 dad was 40 when he got his last medal and 32 when he got his first i am 28 now so theres plenty of time i can now give this everything i have over the next four years
7090359 its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
7090360 as we see this phenomenon occurring farther and farther north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
7090361 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
7090362 if you look where atiga landed it was past the dead ball line
7090363 but we didnt lose because of that we didnt get our lineout going and what ball we did have we didnt treasure
7090364 after that though it was pretty average we made a lot of basic errors and we looked a bit tentative and disjointed but you can never take away that work ethic and commitment from the boys
7090365 i think our all blacks brought some confidence for a young prop like paea faanunu to be out there and maybe feeling some pressure it was great for him to look around and see kev mealamu and johnny afoa next to him
7090366 dir que s a esa idea pero no porque ya est en desarrollo ni nada de eso

7090370 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7090371 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7090372 it appears as though they had a platonic relationship that went back 20 years
7090373 its warm its noisy and its pungent in there and the bats are flying all around you its really really cool
7090374 its something to do and its fun yeah its dirty work

7090377 the government of israel has decided to allow the two boats to get into gaza the decision was made because we wanted to avoid the media provocation on the high seas that they were apparently planning

7090380 hillsong and other parties have approached us about the south sydney hospital site which is publicly known to be zoned for redevelopment
7090381 the city is regularly approached by developers or other groups about our properties
7090382 any eventual development will be subject to a development application process and will need to respect the sites heritage items
7090383 it is truly just two bus stops up the road
7090384 i would hope the council would not be interested in entertaining a mega church or entertainment centre on the hospital site this has nothing to do with religion we are extremely worried about the traffic
7090385 it would be good site for a future school or hospital or aged care facility
7090386 i have been convinced by the residents that its absolutely the wrong area to have a mega church with a 3000 odd seat auditorium the traffic issues in a quiet suburb would be awful the council should put a caveat on what it could be used for saying it has to be an aged care facility or something

7090406 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7090407 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7090408 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7090409 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7090410 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7090411 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7090412 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7090413 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7090414 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7090415 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7090416 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7090417 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7090418 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7090419 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7090420 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7090421 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7090422 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7090423 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7090424 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7090425 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7090426 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7090427 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7090428 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7090429 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7090430 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7090431 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7090432 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7090433 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7090434 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7090435 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually

7090445 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

7090447 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7090448 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7090449 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7090450 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7090451 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7090452 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7090453 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7090454 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7090455 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7090456 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7090457 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7090458 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7090459 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7090460 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7090461 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7090462 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7090463 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7090464 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7090465 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7090466 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7090467 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7090468 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7090469 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7090470 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7090471 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7090472 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7090473 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7090474 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7090475 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7090476 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7090477 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7090478 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7090479 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7090480 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7090481 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7090482 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7090483 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7090484 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7090485 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7090486 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7090487 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7090488 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7090489 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7090490 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7090491 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7090492 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7090493 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7090494 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7090495 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7090496 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7090497 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7090498 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one

7090503 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7090504 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7090505 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7090506 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

7090513 together the polyphenols in berries and walnuts and the fatty acids in the walnuts fluidize the nerve cell membrane
7090514 they make it more responsive to a wide array of signals
7090515 the effects of natural combinations such as walnuts and blueberries or strawberries or blackberries are powerful
7090516 doses that could reasonably be achieved in the adult human diet
7090517 and its fun to talk about its something that people can use right now adding walnuts and berries or purple grape juice to the diet could delay the onset of the degenerative diseases of aging

7090524 our team has worked hard and we have enjoyed great local support
7090525 in joe you have both someone who can step right in as well as someone whose going to help him really get the votes he needs to get to be president
7090526 he can stand there and say you know i understand that you have a remarkable life story but let me tell you something i know something about foreign policy and youre not right senator
7090527 this is a guy who obviously enjoys the sound of his own voice
7090528 i thought heres a guy with a take on this issue i dont think ive seen
7090529 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large
7090530 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
7090531 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
7090532 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
7090533 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
7090534 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
7090535 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
7090536 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
7090537 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
7090538 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
7090539 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence
7090540 experience to the democratic ticket and thats what biden is for
7090541 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time hell get it right again

7090550 i offered to pay for that one sign if they would agree to use gender neutral ones
7090551 the head of the work crew said he had gender neutral signs but refused to use them no charges were filed
7090552 signs such as men at work unintentionally reinforce the idea that only men are suited for and are capable of doing outdoor physical jobs
7090553 the response is weve seen none of those signs theyre not out there
7090554 my guess is that atlanta probably bought a bunch of signs back in the late 70s early 80s and maybe werent aware of the change
7090555 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7090556 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent

7090560 who do people say that the son of man is
7090561 some say john the baptist but others elijah and still others jeremiah or one of the prophets
7090562 you are the messiah the son of the living god
7090563 blessed are you simon son of jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father in heaven 18and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades will not prevail against it 19i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
7090564 sure you can this has never happened before but let me go and make the arrangements
7090565 but what if things dont work out could we also get a divorce in heaven
7090566 it took me three months to find a pastor up here do you have any idea how long its going to take for me to find a lawyer
7090567 who do people say that the son of man is
7090568 you are the messiah the son of the living god
7090569 some say you are john the baptist other elijah and still others jeremiah or one of the prophets
7090570 you are the messiah the son of the living god

7090574 i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven
7090575 we are happy to partner with community blood services again and we know that our community will come out and help us as we do our part to reduce the state wide blood shortage
7090576 its like sitting on your back porch and driving your house
7090577 their projected rates of expansion are so fast that we dont have a hope in hell of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
7090578 we are blessed by the fact that our friend and neighbor is also our number one supplier of foreign oil
7090579 the amount of energy that you have to use to get that oil out of the ground is such that it actually creates a much greater impact on climate change as well as using much more energy than even traditional petroleum
7090580 if american mayors want to send their money to unstable undemocratic countries in the middle east instead of to canada that will be their call if they want to pay a premium for iranian saudi iraqi oil that will be their call
7090581 do you think americans are going to be paying a buck or a buck fifty more because somebody said that our carbon footprint is higher than oil from kazakhstan
7090582 you have to consider the environmental impact in a broader context
7090583 there is significant economic benefit from the development of oil sands the oil sands represent a very secure reliable long term source of supply to the united states people in the u s will have to judge whether that supply stacks up to other alternatives
7090584 they say no no were going to do research and really clean up our act well you cant give these guys permission to go ahead on the promise that something is going to happen in the future
7090585 for 40 years a couple of oil companies worked on the tar sands extraction process not its environmental impacts it was albertas massive expansion of tar sands leasing over the last few years ignoring serious unanswered environmental and public health concerns that created this mushrooming crisis
7090586 it would be the equivalent of several hundred exxon valdez oil spills

7090593 he covers issues of interest to all aboriginal peoples from around the world not just native americans
7090594 i do not feel we should forfeit the traditional rights and privileges of the natives of our islands for a mere thimbleful of votes in congress that we the lovers of hawaii from long association with it should sacrifice our birthright for the greed of alien desires to remain on our shores

7090607 i was getting a little worrid that obama was going to let that that rich fuck mccain steal the thing but this biden pick turns that around the last thing we need is four more years of republicans taking care of thier buds in the oil business and letting our jobs all go to china biden can and will call bullshit on mccains bullshit
7090608 we needed this after the year weve had no doubt about that all the whelen engineering guys have been working so hard to get this no 30 corvette up front the first half of the season was a disaster and the way we view it is the second half of the season is the start of our season road america was a good finish and here we are at mosport where the corvettes have always done well we won here last year so i feel comfortable the whelen corvette is doing great and were hoping for a repeat of last year
7090609 it certainly helped that the qualifying ended early because i think there were cars some cars that would have been faster than i was
7090610 i was counting down the time with the guys on the radio saying is it done
7090611 ford has not announced a replacement but the new boss will have his or her work cut out as the australian market adjusts from its high horsepower diet to more fuel efficient vehicles
7090612 it was a great moment and the feeling is mostly relief
7090613 yesterday i just didnt feel like myself today i was climbing back up getting it back a little bit but that last 200 still didnt feel like me it was a struggle a well fought struggle and im really really happy
7090614 the gold medal was the dream for me im happy that i have the silver and i hope my country is proud of me but this silver just pushes me even harder to come back and win that gold medal
7090615 i knew i had the ability but i didnt know if i really had it on today im really thrilled and i couldnt be happier
7090616 when you give people chances and allow them to come back from their mistakes great things happen and im a perfect example that you shouldnt give up on people
7090617 im just really happy its hard work for my entire life that came through now
7090618 i trained really hard for this and im just really happy that i finally get a medal in my individual event
7090619 my silver medal is gold to me because of all the bad things that happened to me this year
7090620 this is the olympics this is it why play it safe
7090621 you might as well put it all on the line and go for broke and it paid off today with a silver medal
7090622 i kind of fought my way on there and i thought theres no time like the present
7090623 i tried to make it a battle of pure willpower i gave it everything i had
7090624 the support weve had all year everybodys recognized that we had a shot at this thing such enthusiasm such support and thats a big motivator to us
7090625 we all say thank you very much to those who support it and those who believe in us
7090626 i was just honoured to be here competing in my third games for canada and to come out again on the podium with a silver medal i dont think its sunk in yet but im really happy
7090627 we never stopped we just kept on pushing every stroke
7090628 we had to find a little something extra to get beyond them
7090629 i knew that prilukov could catch me because he did in the 400 freestyle
7090630 i won a match to get the bronze and youre losing a match to get the silver
7090631 i knew i wanted to go in with supreme confidence in my abilities and not doubting myself one second thats what i did and i wrestled the match of my life and it was awesome
7090632 it was a tough race we tried to ignore the fact that we havent had a medal yet as a country and just focus on our two kilometres
7090633 the people have proved that when they cannot countenance allotting 800 kanals of land to non state individuals or institutions they cannot keep the entire paradise of kashmir under indian occupation for long
7090634 the cry for freedom and the right of self determination has been raised by the people on their own and it is the people who have launched the movement
7090635 india is misleading the world by portraying the current upsurge as an issue of land a fight for opening roads and an agitation against the economic blockade therefore it is necessary to counter this propaganda by passing a resolution which would also send a clear message to the world community
7090636 the ujc has unanimously decided that there will be absolutely no militant activities wherever rallies processions and marches take place in the valley and militants will not be allowed to display arms
7090637 militants active in the field for the past 20 years have been ordered to keep their guns silent in view of the mass movement and under no circumstances undertake operations in civilian populated areas that might give the indian forces to open fire or perpetrate violence
7090638 according to the decision the militants have been strictly told to join the mass rallies to demand freedom without displaying arms
7090639 with deep respect and humility i appeal to the hurriyat leadership to display large heartedness in accommodating each other and carrying everyone along
7090640 so long as the leadership is united the people are with them but if heavens forbid indian investments pay off and the leadership disintegrates nothing will save them from public wrath
7090641 in order to rectify past mistakes the leadership should take all along who are sincerely in favour of siding with the present movement the leadership should leave no scope for elements to shoot holes in the unity on the basis of minor differences
7090642 the top ranking leadership is united which is a good omen but now it should act generously by embracing those who want to want to move forward with the movement their past misdeeds should be forgiven
7090643 but if they still continue to harm the movement they should be given such punishment as would acts as a deterrent and warning for others
7090644 this is not the final solution of the kashmir issue but an initial step the road should not be like the srinagar muzaffarabad bus service but operational throughout the year and kashmiri fruit and other products should reach markets in central asia
7090645 it would include refusal to pay taxes and refusal to work in government offices
7090646 they have begun talking in terms of freedom on seeing the current public mood but on the other hand they are keeping up their tawaf pilgrimage or circumambulation of delhi which reflects their double dealing
7090647 efforts should be continued to rope them into the movement but if they do not change their tack despite these endeavours then social boycott could be a measure of last resort
7090648 if they the pro india leaders severe their ties with india and join the ranks of the movement they can be given even better positions
7090649 the invitation for talks should be to resolve the kashmir issue there is no harm in talking if it is a trilateral process where pakistan and the people of kashmir are included as primary parties
7090650 talks between india and pakistan which sideline kashmiris cannot solve the kashmir issue nor can the kashmiris accept a solution arrived at through the bilateral process
7090651 the social and political unrest completely disrupting industrial activities in the last two months has jeopardised the states economy with industrial losses mounting over rs 5 000 crore rs 50 billion
7090652 losses will further mount if the agitation does not subside exports will completely cease and the state will be driven towards complete economic upheaval
7090653 hundreds of gujjar families have reportedly been forced to flee their homes in various parts of jammu following attacks by armed hooligans and even the persons in whose premises the hapless gujjars have taken refuge in jammu are now being targeted by the police
7090654 cosmetic reasons dished out by the administration should not prevail upon lives of defenseless people
7090655 where was the administration when bajrang dal and vhp were openly holding weapon training camps in jammu and spitting venom against minorities
7090656 our cadres are being threatened regularly in jammu and despite repeated cautions police has failed to take any action against the criminals indulging in such deplorable acts
7090657 i think its about time i think it shouldve been prosecuted some time ago when they initially had the instance and the opportunity to do it

7090708 dopo il raduno al formicoso del 18 agosto scorso col concerto di vinicio capossela il convegno sviluppo sostenibile e centri minori del 21 agosto scorso tenuto presso labbazia del goleto la presentazione del documentario la voce del paesaggio di franco arminio autore di vento forte tra lacedonia e candela edito da laterza vuole rappresentare un ulteriore momento di aggregazione della gente dirpinia che si ritrova compatta ad affermare il diritto alla difesa del proprio territorio contro ogni ulteriore abuso e violenza e per riaffermare la scelta oramai fatta di superare logiche assistenzialiste e di delega totale ad una classe e ad un sistema politico oramai allo sfascio totale

7090757 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7090758 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7090759 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
7090760 hi im thinking about you and praying for you i love you ambre
7090761 um what exactly do you mean by love do you mean love love cause if you do im sorry that i led you on

7090765 but the intensity was there the boys got up and did what had to be done the hard way they guts ed it out it was not straightforward and im very happy with the composure
7090766 the boys got up and met the physicality of the springboks they did huge work and it was a good effort

7090772 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7090773 just the day before yesterday you are here and discussing with us about our needs
7090774 it is just one day later and you bring the needed materials
7090775 you look wonderful youre well dont return to a sinning life or something worse might happen
7090776 in selecting senator joe biden as his running mate senator obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of
7090777 senator bidens record in the united states senate is one of support and understanding that has been unwavering throughout his career
7090778 we only need to look back to the recent passage of the repeal of the hiv travel and immigration ban to see the type of leadership we can expect from senator biden on the issues important to our community
7090779 it was because of his determination and tenacity that we were able to see this relic of discrimination against people living with hiv aids torn down
7090780 if the support senator biden has proven on our issues is any indication of the type of vice president he will be than our community can be assured that senator obama has chosen a thoughtful and staunch advocate for equality as his closest adviser
7090781 the homosexual movement threatens the strength and survival of the american family
7090782 with the selection of senator biden democrats now have a national ticket that is ready to lead our party to victory this november
7090783 our endorsed candidate senator barack obama has called stonewall democrats a powerful grassroots force in our politics and it is this grassroots infrastructure that we will now use to elect the obama biden ticket
7090784 he must tell it to me in person not via anybody
7090785 he didnt tell me anything and as he is fit my duty is bringing him theres no doubt
7090786 i havent been surprised by his declarations but i was just expecting it earlier
7090787 theres no drama in this its part of the game and im convinced robinho is going to stay put
7090788 what happened is not a problem at all to me because i know it doesnt come from him
7090789 i am happy knowing that i find myself in front of a tough challenge but it is also fascinating
7090790 i have a one objective now to see torino develop for all the fans
7090791 im really happy to have won this is the first time ive ever beaten tom boonen
7090792 my liquigas team mates worked really hard for me in the final part of the race chicchi did an excellent job in the final kilometre to set me up and then i accelerated hard and the tailwind helped me this gives me a lot of confidence for the vuelta espana ill be up against boonen and quick step in the sprints so im looking forward to what will be a daily battle
7090793 how did you come up with the idea for your start up
7090794 as successful organizations what did you do right or wrong
7090795 okay hes scottish and he works in space and hes an engineer and hes a bit of a brawler
7090796 who are the next big things in rock or alternate music
7090797 we deem never to let ourselves become part of the unthinking majority
7090798 you guys remember what i said about the olympics being just another race yeah we said that was a lie he said it s totally different
7090799 this is chris favourite song his band wont play it so were doing him a favour
7090800 he played his first show at reading 2007 he blew it he fuck the whole show sideways
7090801 but i dont think its premature to say max has won this years most improved award
7090802 a lot of guys ask us why we dont have a back drop were the only band on the main stage who dont have one well its because the songs speak for themselves and we find that associating that kind of theatrics with them insulting
7090803 that and we forgot the back drop we actually have a really nice one
7090804 i have received reports of five deaths however i have to re check before confirming the death of laxmanananda saraswati
7090805 it was good for us we knew that facility very well and it was nice and loud for us so we had that going but it was also about a lot of good players playing well and thats what we have to have at the new place
7090806 i think its going to be a great time for us to get started on a new year a fresh year
7090807 guys are coming back i think its just all around great for this city and this state to bring a new stadium here and have us start doing bigger things
7090808 the first couple of games you only get about 15 plays last week we got 25
7090809 so far its gone pretty good except for getting field goals instead of touchdowns
7090810 it was very difficult and it is very difficult to get motivated but with the help of friends family and my agent we just keep pressing on
7090811 you have to keep looking at that light you have to keep saying something could happen and you have to be ready for it
7090812 when we came in here that was our goal was to get better as an individual and as an offensive unit and weve done that
7090813 mr asif zardari has accepted to contest the election for the office of president of pakistan after the party unanimously drafted him to do so
7090814 sure love it is on the driveway if you need to go tinkles please water the grass
7090815 obamas in much better shape because he seems to have very good standing in the places that john kerry won and very good opportunities in a number of other states that look like they could go to the democrats
7090816 mccains fundamental problem is theres only one way home for him replicate the bush electoral victory state by state
7090817 the fundamental truth remains that this race is extremely tight mccain is in strong position in ohio and florida two states that have been critical for republican victories and hes better positioned today in michigan than the president was in either 2000 or 2004
7090818 the last primary season is a direct result of 1968
7090819 had there been party leaders who had a major role in choosing the nominee this year it is probably much more likely it would have been a hillary clinton rather than a young barack obama
7090820 i think people figured if these guys cant run a convention without battling each other in the street and on the floor of the convention hall how the hell can they run the country
7090821 as representatives and senators saw the way students were taking to the streets they thought wed be better off if we channeled this into regular participation and not street politics
7090822 it became one of those images that has lasted and stuck with us
7090823 they came here to agitate and they did a fantastic job
7090824 joe biden has declared that obama a former part time state legislator and u s senator for just three years not ready to be president
7090825 one of the defining dynamics of 2008 has been the emerging wave of new young voters getting involved and storming the gates of the traditional political establishment
7090826 they have plenty of cousin pupfish in other parts of the desert who are also endangered but none are as bad off as the devils hole variety whose loss would bring an ignoble end to a species with a celebrated and controversial history the devils hole apostrophe long fell to the quirks of government cartographers and scientists who render both the site and fish without it

7090828 my parents grew up during the great depression and they had to conserve to survive
7090829 but they not only learned how to make do with a lot less but also how to have fun with it
7090830 they really did learn that the best things in life are free
7090831 treading lightly the joy of conservation moderation and the simple life
7090832 grew up at a time when resources were cherished and they summoned the creativity to make quilts from old clothing artwork from potential discards and repairs with available scraps
7090833 my mother irrigates the garden with rinse water from the washing machine she makes rugs out of old pantyhose as the recipient of a holiday card she cuts off the artwork to send as a postcard
7090834 she saves hair clippings to fill pincushions and is rumored to hoard used dental floss plastic storage bags are washed out and reused uneaten food is frozen and served
7090835 my mothers primary mode of transportation is a decades old schwinn and her sewing machine is a half century old singer and yes my mother darns socks
7090836 and she is one of the happiest people i know
7090837 the critics of conservationism and environmentalism argue that those of us who want to conserve and lead simpler lives would have everybody wear grass skirts and live in a cave
7090838 part of the title of the book moderation reflects that many of us are actually practical and use common sense in our efforts to conserve our resources
7090839 i am not preaching conservationism im trying to show how it actually makes people happier than buying and using too much stuff
7090840 we dont lead exemplary lives that they and others do but we try to do our part and even what little we do compared to others has made us happier
7090841 i went for a year without buying all the gadgets and clothes and other nonessentials that i used to purchase
7090842 i actually had more fun going without all that stuff than i did when i was buying it i also saved some money as well
7090843 my parents and their generation are the experts on how to live a life of conservation and moderation and get joy from that life
7090844 they can provide so many gems of wisdom for the younger generations and i have tried to include as many of those gems as possible in the book
7090845 it hasnt been the type of road youd want to follow or go down but its something i created for myself and had to fight through i almost threw it away on my own but i made the best of it
7090846 i didnt know it had come through the skin until i got to the doctor
7090847 i looked at it like id never use my arm again
7090848 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7090849 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7090850 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7090851 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7090852 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things
7090853 but i think i deserved a couple of things that didnt come to me
7090854 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7090855 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind

7090860 est bamos mareados y con n useas est bamos cansados pero la ltima hora recuperamos las fuerzas
7090861 accountability and self reliance love of country working hard without making excuses treating your neighbor as youd like to be treated
7090862 her fear of black men who passed by her on the street
7090863 where decency and endurance and the pioneer spirit were joined at the hip with conformity and suspicion and the potential for unblinking cruelty
7090864 but that was the age difference and not that she was mean or anything
7090865 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7090866 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7090867 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue

7090876 more energy sharper and better memory more restful sleep healthier blood pressure shinier hair and younger looking skin
7090877 it might not be appropriate to say that you can reverse normal aging but at least you can slow it down
7090878 juvenon should definitely give a person more energy if you have more mitochondria youll have more energy
7090879 if someone has tried proven therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy and antidepressants but still suffers from cognitive trouble supplements might be worth a try
7090880 i dont want to say that everybody should go to the store and get it
7090881 a estar preparados y no caer en las provocaciones la estrategia es desprestigiar al s diciendo que somos violentos
7090882 van a apuntar a vejar al presidente de la rep blica porque saben que soy la figura m s visible de este cambio hist rico en el pa s

7090889 el avi n arranc y empez el traqueteo en la pista antes de despegar hice el comentario como que iba suavecito iba muy suave
7090890 se separaron las ruedas del suelo est bamos en el aire pero muy pegados al suelo entonces el avi n hizo un giro como si el ala bajara muy bruscamente hacia un lado
7090891 escuchaba gritos de la gente ah qu pasa qu pasa
7090892 intent levantarme pero no pod a el humo me quemaba la cara
7090893 hab a un se or mayor muy disgustado pero lo nico que pensaba era que l podr a estar metiendo un poquito de prisa por el retraso en el despegue
7090894 why should we sign up for scripts4ning if a precedent has been set by ning that they can take third party widgets away from us widget labs was providing a level of service no other developer was offering how are we supposed to trust ning to not pull the plug on anybody else we rely on
7090895 the great things about ning is that even though we dont offer this functionality there are 3rd party developers out there meeting those needs or with a little php and css you can customize it all you want
7090896 for all the lengths senators barack obama and john mccain have gone to in keeping their hunt for a vice president under wraps their deliberations are in some ways being conducted in plain sight in indiana last week mr obama appeared with
7090897 barack is in a different situation and he needs somebody who can be safe and steady
7090898 its time to bite the bullet senator nunn get with the program
7090899 as can be seen by revisiting nunns past words and deeds the true source behind opposition to gay service was never concerns about unit cohesion as was often stated but moral animus to gay rights
7090900 strongly held moral belief that homosexuals should not be role models for our children
7090901 american family deterioration is one of the biggest problems we face in our culture
7090902 if obama picks former sam nunn as his vice presidential running mate
7090903 i would have a hard time voting for the democratic ticket i would be virtually useless in trying to convince other gays and lesbians to support the ticket
7090904 nunns positions on equal rights for the lgbt community should be reason enough to keep him off the ticket
7090905 the idea of obama picking nunn to run as his vice president is preposterous
7090906 as sen barack obama considers potential running mates he should contemplate with caution
7090907 if obama taps nunn he could end up adding gay men and lesbians to the list of disgruntled democrats they might not vote for mccain but they might very well stay home
7090908 revisiting is not admitting a mistake or apologizing for the pain he inflicted or the tens of thousands of lives affected by the policy surely there are more compelling choices out there for vice president
7090909 we dont think he would be a good choice i dont think there is any serious talk of him being selected for vice president i dont think its something our community should be alarmed about but its something our community should be aware of
7090910 for all nunns qualifications there would be very little enthusiasm for him within the lgbt community
7090911 as can be seen by revisiting nunns past words and deeds the true source behind opposition to gay service was never concerns about unit cohesion as was often stated but moral animus to gay rights
7090912 senator nunn has got to go all the way on opening the military to qualified gays and lesbians who want to serve not half way as hes been doing lately
7090913 no single issue more poignantly snaps our armed forces into the 21st century than the question of whether homosexuals should be permitted to serve openly in their ranks
7090914 our military cannot afford to stray long from the society it defends the pressures for it to catch up are mounting within and without
7090915 it might be time to take another look at dont ask dont tell
7090916 because hes an interesting black man he needs a sober experienced older establishment player who will be respected by the press the first responders of the political game theyll set the tone in which the choice is celebrated or not he needs someone like sam nunn
7090917 obama is going to need people who understand the global landscape and know how to work washington to get things done and thats where nunn can be a huge help
7090918 frankly the assertion that gays liberal and democratic gays that is may sit out the presidential race if nunn is chosen by obama is difficult to take seriously given obamas record in illinois and in the senate his overall ideology and the effusive endorsement of him earlier this month by the human rights campaign the nations largest gay lesbian bisexual and transgender civil rights group its absurd to suggest that politically interested gays who otherwise agree with obama and share his values would withhold their vote if he selected nunn to join his ticket
7090919 i reported that to them and they had both of those names on their list
7090920 if barack obama selected georgias former u s senator sam nunn as his vice presidential running mate would you be more or less likely to vote for barack obama
7090921 but nunn may be the best pick for barack obama in a year when the presumptive democratic nominee has no obvious choices if some potential candidate could immediately offer strength to obama on the economy he should pick him or her but no one fits that bill which leaves the field open to a foreign policy heavyweight who could help compensate for the slim resume of a freshman senator the notion that obama would be better off pretending this weakness didnt exist that he should double down on change with a young running mate ignores the readiness bar obama still needs to clear
7090922 on the whole nunns resistance to gays in the military 15 years ago it ought to be noted would be a plus for an obama led ticket not a minus obama unlike john mccain doesnt really have a problem with his base in this election
7090923 a nunn candidacy will be opposed by many in the gay community because of his advocacy of the
7090924 last week just before the fourth of july former georgia senator sam nunn predicted dont ask dont tell will ultimately end
7090925 big issues such as energy policy the war in iraq and health care and washingtons inability to deal with them are weighing on the former senator he loves to solve the problem said gordon giffin former chief counsel for nunn nunn seems to have studied obamas entire platform he thinks he can make a contribution now obamas team said the illinois senator deeply respects senator nunns leadership on national security nunns former chief of staff said the nations daunting problems have made nunn a lifelong democrat with gravitas and a reputation as a problem solver a particularly attractive candidate this year
7090926 bob barrs libertarian candidacy will likely hurt republicans in georgia and help put the state in play for obama georgia has 15 electoral votes a 30 vote swing but obama wont take georgia without sam nunn as his running mate nunn is also a leading democratic thinker on defense and foreign policy issues
7090927 the traveling press corps trailing the presumptive democratic nominees campaign bombarded bayh and nunn with questions over reports both democrats are on obamas shortlist for vice president
7090928 it is always nice to have your name mentioned it is an honor but i have no expectation of being offered any office and i am not in any way sitting on the edge of a chair ready to go back into government
7090929 sen barack obama was flanked by two potential running mates wednesday as experts talked about dirty bombs anthrax and attacks on the nations computer infrastructure many eyes were trained on evan bayh of indiana and sam nunn of georgia both have been listed as potential obama running mates and both live in key red states that obamas campaign has targeted for the general election
7090930 for all the lengths senators barack obama and john mccain have gone to in keeping their hunt for a vice president under wraps their deliberations are in some ways being conducted in plain sight in indiana last week mr
7090931 barack is in a different situation and he needs somebody who can be safe and steady
7090932 it is harder to tell whether the dollar is shifting oil or the opposite
7090933 its obvious that there is a relationship and that they intensify the moves of each other
7090934 as long as we hold 110 it doesnt mean much in the grand scheme
7090935 it was the cliched emotional roller coaster every time you do an ivf cycle theres optimism or pessimism then if it doesnt work theres depression i also had one miscarriage after six weeks
7090936 but then on our 11th attempt finally success weve never been happier
7090937 i just want to give some reassurance that it can actually work even if you are having failure after failure
7090938 for lindsay and i it wasnt an age thing we are like 1per cent of the population in that we are unable to fall pregnant naturally you want to be in the 1per cent bracket for other things but not incompatible fertility
7090939 people knew we were trying to get pregnant although everyone is very well meaning advice like take a holiday and stop thinking about it made me want to scream we cant have babies naturally so ivf is our only choice
7090940 it seems everyone is getting pregnant at ten its like a creche in here
7090941 youre always happy for someone else when they get pregnant i was thrilled for them but there was a little voice inside me saying when is it my turn
7090942 kath robinson went through ivf too and had twins so she has been a great help
7090943 im so anxious its ridiculous the doctors say couples who go though ivf are nervous nellys but ive had a few false alarms with some bleeding which is really nerve wracking when we saw our baby and saw the heartbeat lindsay and i had a huge sigh of relief
7090944 if youre not willing to hit something yourself than you ought to keep your thoughts to yourself
7090945 well if seeing this put you off eating pigs would seeing blood put you off touching offals

7090954 it is clear that they were kidnapped because their schedule was to come back to the hotel before 12 in the afternoon and we dont have their whereabouts

7090957 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7090958 many pharmaceutical companies have approached us for carrying out clinical trials for the usage of solanesol as anti cancer and anti diabetic drugs
7090959 solanesol has excellent prospects in future as drug and ctri would soon distribute the rights for production of drugs in the market
7090960 increasing intensity of coffee drinking was inversely associated with parkinsons disease
7090961 increasing dosage and intensity of total caffeine consumption were also inversely associated with high dosage presenting a significant inverse association with parkinsons disease
7090962 given the complexity of parkinsons disease these environmental factors likely do not exert their effects in isolation thus highlighting the importance of gene environment interactions in determining parkinsons disease susceptibility
7090963 smoking and caffeine possibly modify genetic effects in families with parkinsons disease and should be considered as effect modifiers in candidate gene studies for parkinsons disease
7090964 id be very surprised if this did not have a similar effect in people
7090965 london is most definitely a world leader in all of this
7090966 if you dont smoke dont start and if you do smoke stop
7090967 we think that something in smoke keeps the level of the nos2a down so cells dont produce nitric oxide which decreases cell damage
7090968 it really is ironic that something good might ultimately come out of smoking
7090969 it is definitely a window of opportunity that we are working on
7090970 the other problem is that these things are not curing anything only treating the symptoms while the process is still going on
7090971 id like to be able to identify people that are at a high risk of parkinsons disease so we can provide them information to change their lifestyle or give them a drug to stop them getting it
7090972 holding a cigarette is like having a walking stick in your hand giving you support
7090973 in china today the economy comes first and everything else is secondary including health care
7090974 you wonder if anyone in the government is conscious of how great the smoking problem is theres no public education program the chinese anti smoking association is very weak and has almost no money within 20 years china could have the majority of all smoking deaths in the world
7090975 the tobacco industry is so huge and the anti tobacco movement is so weak
7090976 what were doing is just a drop in the ocean
7090977 ten years ago when we first came to china it was unheard of for young women to smoke
7090978 more than 90 per cent of my friends smoked so i couldnt be different
7090979 and its helpful for my work offering a cigarette is a social greeting whenever you meet a friend or a stranger i know that smoking isnt good once i stopped smoking for a month or two but my friends persuaded me to smoke again
7090980 the government should be doing more we need promotion campaigns to tell people about it
7090981 we used to incinerate the fake cigarettes which is wasteful and causes air pollution
7090982 everyone wants me to fight k fed because hes a notorious celebrity dad and so am i its for charity its serious boxing you have to go get a trainer i have to register with the mature boxing association
7090983 i dont care who it is its for charity ive been beaten up by the press so i dont care if i get a few shots by a kid half my age
7090984 we clean the capital we are treated like rubbish ourselves we demand that every cleaner on the tube get papers so that we can end the abuse of these companies they are all corrupt they have the money they could afford to treat us with dignity and respect
7090985 it was a preemptive abuse of process to diffuse any attempt at establishing a tent city
7090986 theyre just jumping the fence helping themselves to whatever they can find so we had to start hanging things overhead so they couldnt reach and were taking a lot of things home
7090987 people trying to help you out but they dont see it that way just opportunists they dont call themselves thieves call themselves opportunists
7090988 none of the churches in the area have any intention of bringing tent city to the area
7090989 grant me the treasure of sublime poverty permit the distinctive sign of our order to be that it does not possess anything of its own beneath the sun for the glory of your name and that it have no other patrimony than begging
7090990 preserve the sacred character of assisi without damaging its welcome
7090991 this western fair thing is getting a little tired so weve decided to cancel stampede though i trust that tourists will flock here in july all the same
7090992 saint francis is the saint of the poor and his teachings are still relevant
7090993 recommended recourse to begging only when it was not possible to sustain oneself through work
7090994 the city needed an eye opener and then the whole country found out
7090995 tent city taught us the importance of recognizing that we needed to be proactive this year
7090996 hopefully what were doing this year will overall enable us to house people before a tent city would ever develop
7090997 i dont even want to go there because everything were doing is to prevent that from happening
7090998 that was in a sad way one of the benefits of tent city it did force some relationships and helped us break down some barriers
7090999 our housing support team in some ways evolved out of the work at tent city
7091000 we have a team that works to help people find housing and then to keep people in housing because just finding people housing is not enough
7091001 it feels so good to have your own place you can rest you can shower you can bake
7091002 i dont think i could ever live like that again its too hard
7091003 i often said when we were on the streets that we just needed a roof over our heads
7091004 we have lots of people we could house if we could find affordable and accessible housing
7091005 theres a lot more demand than we have service availability
7091006 were in that process of developing those services or connecting them to those services
7091007 they werent strangers who came to live in our community they were us
7091008 the foreclose rate really highlights the governments inability to prevent homelessness
7091009 were pushing the government to provide more funds for rental assistance or emergency assistance oftentimes this covers a first months rent and moving expenses if a person is short just that one month its enough help to get a person back on their feet
7091010 its harder to get out of being homeless than it is to prevent homelessness
7091011 when children are involved its even harder to be flexible because you have a larger family to feed
7091012 half of my people leave in the middle of the day to donate plasma because they need some kind of income for the day
7091013 you are supposed to be some kind of high tech visionary electronic books are the future how can you not own a kindle you ought to be ashamed of yourself

7091026 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber

7091064 steves advice was no matter what you do in comedy just be honest it must come from a real place and if you believe it it will be funny that stuck with me just knowing that if you believe it everyone else will
7091065 skylar came up to me early on when i was performing
7091066 skylar actually said why dont you do this i remember thinking hang on who is this guy ive been doing this 20 years this is his first movie and hes got an idea for me then i realized what he was saying was funnier than my idea he often made smart judgments that seemed to come from a guy who had a much older head on his shoulders
7091067 i dont think this is the last youll see of me
7091068 i am happy and aware i am going into a tough challenge but a very very exciting one
7091069 it was very very hard i knew it would be
7091070 being a player myself going away on international duty and then coming back is always difficult ive had about an hour with all my players this week
7091071 and at times it showed we looked tired very lethargic i think conceding the goal so soon after we had just scored killed us a bit it was very disappointing defending
7091072 phil brown hull boss has had all but two people all week whereas weve had ten players away and it showed at times obviously the expectation because you are playing hull at home a team that has just come up can be mentally draining
7091073 im not pleased with the performance but i can understand why we played that way it will be nice to have a full week with my team
7091074 it was important that we backed up last weeks decent performance im delighted for the players maybe we had a bit of luck
7091075 theres no problem with chimbonda i have to try to pick the right team to get a result pascal and carlos edwards came down as part of the squad today ive got to try to pick team to win the game and it worked out ok i have a decent squad it gives me options
7091076 tottenham caused us one or two problems but we stayed positive and we got our rewards it was a great ball in by murphy and is was a great header
7091077 we had that threat sometimes you are only as good as your strikers lucky for us one of our substitutions worked out and cisse scored
7091078 were here to try to change the stats and history of club we were aware that we had not won here in 30 years
7091079 ive havent been here long and were trying to change things the mentality i believe sunderland fans came down here believing we could get a result instead of hoping i certainly did
7091080 we showed good mental strength to react after tottenham scored you have to have good options and i did today on the bench which i didnt have last season
7091081 we took our chances we stuck at it people might have seen a different side to us we are trying to be a bit more street wise and we had a bit more steel we were raw an innocent last season
7091082 it was important today that we won its well and good running them close but you have to get a result when we played tottenham last year we played quite well against them and we lost 2 0
7091083 even when they equalised today i knew we were up to the challenge
7091084 were not dancing in the streets were building that mentality where we want to come to these places and give them a game
7091085 this time last year we did not get a win away from home until march we need to back it up now at forest on wednesday
7091086 its a good result but lets not get too carried away
7091087 i had no intentions of cisse starting the game he only had his first training session yesterday
7091088 i thought it would be good for him to sit on the bench and plug in to what we are about but its great for him to come on and score hes hit the ground running
7091089 he has got a presence like all good players and i just felt he could contribute today weve had a good result here but im convinced we can play far better
7091090 we must have public officials who will stand up and tell the people exactly what they think

7091126 i dont quite know but theyre part of the party you treat them with respect ill give them an answer
7091127 look we can be bigoted and discriminatory towards atheists too
7091128 obama recognized the gap on national security and he recognized the need to get tougher on mccain and he chose the guy who can most quickly help him on both counts
7091129 there should be no doubt that this is going to be a rough campaign from here on out and biden knows how to fight im sure that was a strong consideration
7091130 this is an admission by barack obama that he doesnt have the experience to be president more than a vice president hes looking for a hand holder or a tutor
7091131 his brain is an asset but his mouth is a major liability when the latter starts trumping the former and it inevitably will the democrats will have a problem on their hands
7091132 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc
7091133 an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
7091134 there are many possible methods to determine age but they are not very accurate the error is about two years
7091135 we all age at different rates at the molecular level
7091136 old politics white senior dc pol who knows what hes teaching the young president
7091137 delaware senator is a safe choice but is not a risk free running mate for barack obama
7091138 an extremely bad day for the baracky hussein obama campaign
7091139 kids 2000 legislation established a public private partnership to provide computer centers teachers internet access and technical training to young people particularly to low income and at risk youth
7091140 he plans to stress the dangers to the security of the average american not just from the terrorist threat but from the lack of health assistance crime and energy dependence on unstable parts of the world
7091141 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7091142 would significantly change the meaning and the degree of offensiveness of bidens comment
7091143 under no administration will i accept the job of secretary of state
7091144 i know a lot of my opponents out there say id be a great secretary of state
7091145 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11
7091146 all party members have unanimously nominated mr zardari for the presidency
7091147 i have no objection over mr zardari contesting presidential election if he removes the 17th amendment
7091148 que arroj nuestro suelo post ltimo proceso militar sin embargo
7091149 leave your child on regular formula until the doctor says he can tolerate milk and then make the switch
7091150 it takes some children a little bit longer to transition and some kids do have food aversions in your sons case i would recommend using the older infant formula just to make sure he gets all the nutrients he needs if he doesnt like the milk dont force it upon him
7091151 higher oil prices will be taken as a distinct negative by traders but this too could be part of a plan by certain vested interests to force the administration to save fannie fre o k bill i give up could you give me a scenario
7091152 nuestra campa a ha sido austera lo que hemos hecho es hablar cara a cara con el pueblo

7091157 if it wasnt for erica i wouldnt know just how evil i am
7091158 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years
7091159 i think i should be very careful with what i say lest folks get the idear were lesbos or something
7091160 you always succeed in making me laugh or cry and think and learn thank you for your blog its a treasure
7091161 youre such a delicate flower i want you to write the blurb for the dust jacket when i finally write my novel
7091162 thats all right erica you can talk dirty to me in kerrville
7091163 you used to be fun you now act like a fascist
7091164 i think someone oughta take ericas comments from all the blogs she visits and mash em together into a new blog
7091165 erica you possess formidable talent i am impressed yet slightly repulsed
7091166 i find myself wandering the blogosphere to read ericas comments almost as much as to read everyones posts really
7091167 oh my gawd what a cutie she is bright eyed and full of wonder i could just listen to that accent all day
7091168 oh erica it is always good to know that brooklyn is in the house
7091169 i like you just the way you are a dooshbag
7091170 girl you are slicker than cow patties on wet dew in the morning and you can play half rubber better than anyone
7091171 one of the sweetest most intelligent and perceptive ladies i have never met
7091172 erica has cornered the market on crap blogging in a highly disgusting but yet entertaining way
7091173 i can have a mason jar of grade a pure d buck goat pee especially delivered to the troll of your choice at any given time
7091174 erica has a heart two sizes too big for her may god bless her and keep her
7091175 omg i so totally rate right now erica has left anti nj words in the comments here on my blog
7091176 beating erica sherman at pool was a rare treat and i think perhaps people should know even at the expense of possibly coming off as a braggart for going on and on about beating this aforementioned individual at her own game
7091177 china julia child and yiddish how do these things go together why in a post by erica of course need you ask lol
7091178 i dont do memes and i dont do links i do do gratuitous sex you know my email
7091179 as you gaze into the mullet remember that the mullet also gazes into you
7091180 that barack obama selected joe biden as his running mate is wholly consistent with his lack of experience and judgment
7091181 joe biden is hardly an agent of change he has been a lifelong politician in washington
7091182 i dont know much about biden but ive heard he has move international experience
7091183 its probably a wise choice because thats one of the areas where obama is perceived as weakest
7091184 hes also argumentative which is a good thing for someone in the second position it takes some pressure off the presidential candidate
7091185 when youre running you try to find something that you have that no one else has
7091186 now that hes part of the ticket that will change
7091187 they are both intellectual and will be able to put together sentences that neither mccain nor whoever he picks as a running mate could never put together
7091188 i love biden he was my second choice for the democratic nominee
7091189 he has good international experience and a long record he puts a lot of weight into the campaign
7091190 he has been an outstanding senator and would have been a good presidential candidate
7091191 i think a woman not necessarily hillary would have been a better choice
7091192 i dont know that much about bidens record and i think thats important when making a choice because obama has said he would rely heavily on the people around him as president
7091193 i dont know yet whether he was a good choice for obama
7091194 until we hear more its hard to say whether he will help or hurt obama
7091195 theres no evidence it has happened and no evidence it will happen
7091196 i applaud senator obamas choice and welcome the addition of such a passionate advocate for women to the democratic ticket
7091197 in selecting sen joe biden as his running mate sen obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of
7091198 sen bidens record in the united states senate is one of support and understanding that has been unwavering throughout his career
7091199 we only need to look back to the recent passage of the repeal of the hiv travel and immigration ban to see the type of leadership we can expect from sen biden on the issues important to our community
7091200 it was because of his determination and tenacity that we were able to see this relic of discrimination against people living with hiv aids torn down
7091201 if the support sen biden has proven on our issues is any indication of the type of vice president he will be than our community can be assured that sen obama has chosen a thoughtful and staunch advocate for equality as his closest adviser

7091213 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7091214 theres a lot of pain that needs to be addressed
7091215 i feel sort of sorry for whoever obama chooses because there will inevitably be some comparisons and shes such a rock star
7091216 will have to speak to and address 2 000 delegates who voted for hillary clinton it could be a tough crowd
7091217 runs with hillary ill vote for him if not i wont vote for him
7091218 ultimately do we have more work to do yes were taking it one week at a time
7091219 you could argue that no one is ever ready to be president
7091220 the last primary season is a direct result of 1968
7091221 had there been party leaders who had a major role in choosing the nominee this year it is probably much more likely it would have been a hillary clinton rather than a young barack obama
7091222 i think people figured if these guys cant run a convention without battling each other in the street and on the floor of the convention hall how the hell can they run the country
7091223 as representatives and senators saw the way students were taking to the streets they thought wed be better off if we channeled this into regular participation and not street politics
7091224 it became one of those images that has lasted and stuck with us
7091225 they came here to agitate and they did a fantastic job
7091226 that kind of thing has happened to her before she is a very nervous athlete
7091227 she is good dont worry shes not in serious condition
7091228 during the last part of the routine the team became exhausted
7091229 the last part was the climax but it went wrong and this was reflected in the score their sharpness was poor as well

7091240 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7091241 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7091242 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent
7091243 thats where we are today in the middle of a financial crisis with the economy sliding into recession with monetary policy at maximum easing and fiscal transfers impotent
7091244 more than a year into the most challenging financial crisis of our times we now face a complex and interlocking combination of rising inflation declining growth tightening credit conditions and widespread liquidity tensions
7091245 these adjustments will not be painless and ensuring that they take place in an orderly manner will pose substantial challenges for policymakers

7091248 john mccain is going to make a very principled choice about who he will stand with
7091249 it will be someone that is ready to lead that shares his vision to change washington and begin to deliver the things that the american people expect
7091250 were voting for commander in chief and there is only one
7091251 either it is going to be john mccain or barack obama this is not a time for a mentor this is a time for a commander in chief
7091252 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions

7091260 shares may rebound after oil prices boosted us stocks shrugging off the negative impact of higher oil prices
7091261 but the upside may be limited as there havent been any changes to the fears about the us financial system and uncertainty about slowing economies
7091262 imports are surging in value which shows that high crude oil prices continue to hurt corporate revenues which are leading to an outflow of income from japan
7091263 earnest graham has a secure hold on the bucs starting running back spot
7091264 in the second half the bucs will look to pound the ball with graham and at the end of the game he should lead the team in carries and will be their goal line back
7091265 i think graham despite the decent numbers last season is a risky rb2
7091266 he has not proven himself to me as a solid consistent contributor at the running back position
7091267 but last year was his first in that capacity so he may grow into a more consistent role

7091336 blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven whose sins are covered blessed are those whose sin the lord does not count against them and in whose spirit is no deceit
7091337 then i acknowledged my sin and did not cover up my iniquity i said i will confess my transgressions to the lord and you forgave the guilt of my sin
7091338 flee the evil desires of the flesh and pursue righteousness faith love and peace along with those who call on the lord out of a pure heart

7091393 take a minute to share a personal note welcoming joe to our movement for change
7091394 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7091395 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7091396 you must never depend on one person i dont think we would have had the success initially without nigel but we are onto our eighth season it feels like its going to be a different show this year because of it and we will see whether thats an advantage or a negative
7091397 i started to get bored because of the middle sections of the show because we had 24 people by the time we hit say show five of the live show i felt i had known them for years the other problem was that they were so media savvy these contestants that they never showed us or you their true personality in parts they were like robots i didnt know much more about them at the end then i did at the beginning i think it could be just more interesting and controversial than we did last year and that will change
7091398 if our laws will not respect the natural law and gods precept then it does not merit any obedience at all
7091399 authority must enact just laws that is laws that correspond to the dignity of the human person and to what is required by right reason
7091400 human law is law insofar as it corresponds to right reason and therefore is derived from the eternal law
7091401 when however a law is contrary to reason it is called an unjust law in such case it ceases to be law and becomes instead an act of violence
7091402 whoever refuses to obey an authority that is acting in accordance with the moral order resists what god has appointed
7091403 bist du mit deiner bisherigen leistung und die art und weise wie das team das gesamte wochenende auf dieser neuen strecke angegangen ist zufrieden
7091404 meiner meinung nach haben wir gro artige arbeit geleistet die art und weise wie wir hierher gekommen und uns vorbereitet haben unsere herangehensweise war meiner meinung nach so gut wie immer
7091405 wir kommen hier wirklich mit einem starken paket an und ich denke dass wir zumindest am dichtesten an ferrari dran sind ich bin ber die arbeit die wir heute geleistet haben wirklich ganz gl cklich dass wir in der ersten reihe stehen bringt uns wirklich in eine gute position um morgen um einen sieg zu k mpfen ich bin sehr sehr gl cklich
7091406 erz hle uns wie es um die strecke bestellt ist denn einige fahrer hatten ein paar schreckmomente ist sie noch rutschig
7091407 ich denke nicht dass sie rutschig ist es gibt meiner meinung nach dort drau en haftung aber wenn man ber das limit geht dann kommt man wohl ber das haftungsniveau das tun alle ungl cklicherweise war felipe in der lage auf dieser linie zu bleiben besonders im ersten sektor und hat die zeit dort herausgeholt
7091408 ich denke dass alle probleme mit blockierenden reifen einer blockierenden hinterachse blockierenden vorderreifen haben es geht wirklich darum dort die beste balance zu finden zu versuchen nicht zu viel druck zu machen aber noch druck zu machen das limit zu finden ich denke nicht dass dies ein problem ist
7091409 wie wird sich dies im rennen selbst auswirken w hrend einer runde ist dies nat rlich eine sache aber wenn die r der mehrmals stehen bleiben k nnte dies ja zu einem problem werden
7091410 in bezug auf die bremsen ist dies hier ein ziemlich harter kurs ich bin mir sicher dass ein paar leute probleme haben werden aber f r uns wird dies kein problem darstellen morgen wird es darum gehen mit den reifen hauszuhalten und zu versuchen sie auf einem longrun zu konservieren ich denke jedoch nicht dass wir ein problem haben werden
7091411 wie liefen die ersten beiden teile des qualifyings denn es schien so zu sein als h ttest du etwas zeit ben tigt um auf geschwindigkeit zu kommen und wir hatten ein paar ungew hnliche namen an der spitze der zeiten tabelle
7091412 der erste qualifying teil war ziemlich gut ich ging auf die strecke fuhr eine runde und ich stand den gro teil der einheit ber auf der pole ich war meine zeit gefahren ich musste nicht noch einmal auf die strecke gehen und als sich die strecke entwickelte fuhren die leute schneller so einfach war dies im zweiten qualifying teil war es sehr sehr berraschend
7091413 wir gingen auf dem weicheren reifen auf die strecke und waren nicht in der lage die zeit im vergleich zum h rteren reifen derart zu verbessern es war definitiv eine berraschung dass ein paar andere teams vorne lagen und so schnell waren wir sind aus diesem grund noch einmal auf die strecke gegangen h tten dies aber nicht wirklich tun m ssen
7091414 du startest zusammen mit felipe aus der ersten reihe wir haben in ungarn gesehen dass er dich auf fantastische art und weise berholt hat denkst du dass es hier raum f r eine revanche gibt
7091415 es ist f r mich eine gute m glichkeit aus der ersten reihe zu starten so wie ich das schon gesagt habe wir wissen nicht wie die starts sein werden wie es ist auf der schmutzigeren oder auf der sauberen seite zu stehen ich denke nicht dass es hier eine besonders saubere oder schmutzige seite gibt
7091416 morgen ist es aus diesem grund meiner meinung nach wichtig dass wir einen guten start hinbekommen und mein ziel wird es sein felipe herauszufordern aber wenn ich nicht nahe genug heran komme dann werde ich einfach versuchen meine position zu behalten
7091417 wir haben geh rt dass es in der boxengasse ein problem mit dem asphalt gibt kannst du uns etwas dar ber erz hlen
7091418 in bezug auf die boxengasse denke ich nicht dass es ein richtiges problem ist zumindest nicht f r uns
7091419 no hay ni una ley ni un reglamento que no conduzca al absurdo
7091420 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7091421 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7091422 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7091423 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7091424 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7091425 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7091426 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7091427 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7091428 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7091429 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7091430 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7091431 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7091432 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7091433 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7091434 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7091435 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7091436 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7091437 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7091438 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7091439 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7091440 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7091441 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7091442 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7091443 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7091444 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7091445 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7091446 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7091447 cheney has essentially been called a co president or by some critics a secret president
7091448 the president of vice president has become much more powerful and certainly anyone who would be looking at taking the number two position on the ticket would certainly think i might have a broader portfolio i might have the opportunity to have a real impact on the administration policies
7091449 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
7091450 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7091451 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7091452 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7091453 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7091454 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7091455 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7091456 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7091457 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7091458 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7091459 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7091460 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7091461 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7091462 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7091463 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7091464 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7091465 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7091466 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7091467 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7091468 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7091469 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7091470 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7091471 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7091472 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7091473 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7091474 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7091475 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7091476 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7091477 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7091478 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7091479 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7091480 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
7091481 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
7091482 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7091483 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7091484 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7091485 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7091486 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7091487 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7091488 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7091489 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7091490 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7091491 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7091492 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7091493 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7091494 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7091495 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7091496 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7091497 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7091498 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7091499 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7091500 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7091501 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7091502 nas discotecas em espanha uma bebida custa sete euros claro que sai muito mais barato dividirmos uma garrafa de rum ou de u sque que custa cerca de doze
7091503 s o ocasi es ptimas para conhecer outras pessoas desde que aqui estamos j conhecemos v rios portugueses e at outros amigos de sevilha que n o conhec amos
7091504 l j n o h botellones como antigamente mas agora h o botell dromo
7091505 n s aqui trazemos sacos para colocar o lixo e isto aqui muito calmo n o vejo qualquer problema
7091506 o qu aqueles militares com as espingardas que ficaram ali parados a olhar para n s eu pensava que se tratava de algum desembarque de droga na praia ou algo do g nero
7091507 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7091508 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7091509 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7091510 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7091511 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7091512 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7091513 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7091514 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7091515 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7091516 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7091517 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7091518 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7091519 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7091520 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7091521 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7091522 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7091523 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7091524 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7091525 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7091526 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7091527 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7091528 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7091529 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7091530 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7091531 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7091532 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7091533 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7091534 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7091535 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
7091536 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
7091537 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7091538 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7091539 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7091540 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7091541 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7091542 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7091543 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7091544 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7091545 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7091546 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7091547 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7091548 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7091549 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7091550 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7091551 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7091552 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7091553 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7091554 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7091555 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7091556 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7091557 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7091558 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7091559 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7091560 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7091561 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7091562 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7091563 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7091564 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7091565 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7091566 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7091567 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7091568 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7091569 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7091570 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7091571 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7091572 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7091573 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7091574 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7091575 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7091576 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7091577 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7091578 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7091579 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7091580 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7091581 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7091582 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7091583 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7091584 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7091585 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7091586 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7091587 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7091588 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7091589 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7091590 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7091591 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7091592 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7091593 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7091594 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7091595 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7091596 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7091597 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7091598 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7091599 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7091600 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama

7091606 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7091607 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7091608 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7091609 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7091610 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7091611 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7091612 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery

7091618 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7091619 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7091620 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7091621 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7091622 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7091623 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7091624 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7091625 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7091626 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7091627 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7091628 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests

7091630 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7091631 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7091632 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7091633 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7091634 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7091635 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7091636 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7091637 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7091638 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7091639 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7091640 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7091641 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7091642 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7091643 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7091644 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7091645 the first thing that i would do is call in john kerry bob kerrey
7091646 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7091647 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7091648 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions

7091663 without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
7091664 establishing check points and buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7091665 may only be implemented in the immediate proximity of south ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of georgian territory
7091666 inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers from the administrative limit between south ossetia and the rest of georgia in a manner such that no significant urban zone would be included
7091667 our foreign partners have done nothing to force tbilisi to use their influence with tbilisi for the signature of a legally binding document
7091668 as i specified at our joint press conference in tbilisi these additional security measures can only be implemented in the immediate proximity of south ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of georgian territory
7091669 more precisely these measures may only be implemented within a zone of a few kilometres from the administrative limits between south ossetia and the rest of georgia in such a way that no major urban centre is included i am thinking in particular of the town of gori
7091670 special arrangements will have to be defined to guarantee freedom of movement along the road and rail routes of georgia
7091671 the presidency of the republic of france for the sake of transparency wished to make public the letter
7091672 its been really rewarding for us to see him outside like this and so healthy were proud of the progress hes made
7091673 when he first came to us he was very thin for his length
7091674 weve estimated hes about 3 or 4 years old but its hard to tell since his growth rate was altered by his limited environment and poor nutrition
7091675 he was so weak when he got here he could barely take two steps his muscles had atrophied pretty badly and he was frightened he had never been in sunshine and grass before and he just stayed huddled up against the wall behind the tortoise exhibit it took a good two months to get him strong enough that we felt he could go outside and walk through the grass like this
7091676 not only could such an animal pose a danger but most people dont have the resources to keep an animal like this the proper environment or food
7091677 they have no idea how to care for it the animal grows bigger than they expected and then ends up in a bad situation or let loose which poses other problems
7091678 we had to get two catch poles to put around the neck and tail
7091679 he was scared so it wasnt an easy task then we were able to get him in one of the cages in the animal control van and we brought him to the zoo
7091680 there really arent that many places around here to rehab an alligator
7091681 its like taking a person out of new york city and throwing him in the rain forest
7091682 he wouldnt know sources of food or how to survive
7091683 when you get people with more money than time and time than money the two will find a way to meet
7091684 rispolverare il concetto di filiera corta in epoca di globalizzazione sicuramente una novit da non sottovalutare
7091685 nel caso di filiere cortissime passaggio diretto dal produttore al venditore
7091686 prossimo al 300 nei casi in cui siano presenti 3 o 4 intermediari oltre al produttore e al distributore finale
7091687 rappresentata in circa il 60 dei casi da un solo intermediario coincidente di norma con il mercato allingrosso
7091688 si caratterizza ancora per la presenza di una moltitudine di strutture di piccola dimensione a fronte dei 19 mercati allingrosso esistenti in francia e dei 23 in spagna in italia sono presenti quasi 150 strutture
7091689 una dimensione pari a meno di un quinto di quella delle realt minori in francia e spagna
7091690 poco meno della met delle strutture italiane risale agli anni sessanta e settanta e quasi un terzo antecedente alla seconda guerra mondiale
7091691 il complesso dei mercati allingrosso si presenta insufficiente a trattare unofferta agricola rilevante ridistribuendola ve quasi sempre poi

7091765 the major political parties first gave credentials to bloggers in 2004 the republicans allowed a dozen bloggers to attend their convention in new york while the democrats gave bloggers 35 seats in the nosebleed section of the fleet center in boston this year the r n c gave credentials to 200 bloggers as a means to get senator mccains message out to more people said joanna burgos the press secretary of the convention for bloggers attending the democratic convention at the pepsi center in denver two types of credentials are offered the first is a national credential which offers the same access granted to members of traditional news media organizations the second more coveted credential is the state blogger credential it allows one blogger per state to cover the convention alongside its state delegation with unlimited floor access

7091775 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7091776 the last primary season is a direct result of 1968
7091777 had there been party leaders who had a major role in choosing the nominee this year it is probably much more likely it would have been a hillary clinton rather than a young barack obama
7091778 i think people figured if these guys cant run a convention without battling each other in the street and on the floor of the convention hall how the hell can they run the country
7091779 as representatives and senators saw the way students were taking to the streets they thought wed be better off if we channeled this into regular participation and not street politics
7091780 it became one of those images that has lasted and stuck with us
7091781 they came here to agitate and they did a fantastic job
7091782 the cautionary note of that convention to the party was to avoid at all costs the kind of open warfare on a platform issue and a large dispute that could take place in prime time
7091783 obamas in much better shape because he seems to have very good standing in the places that john kerry won and very good opportunities in a number of other states that look like they could go to the democrats

7091786 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
7091787 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
7091788 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
7091789 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
7091790 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
7091791 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
7091792 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
7091793 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
7091794 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
7091795 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
7091796 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
7091797 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence
7091798 the last primary season is a direct result of 1968
7091799 had there been party leaders who had a major role in choosing the nominee this year it is probably much more likely it would have been a hillary clinton rather than a young barack obama

7091805 what we have learned from her is that she was in custody for over five years
7091806 i have no doubt that there really are real terrorists out there but she isnt one of them

7091816 their projected rates of expansion are so fast that we dont have a hope in hell of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
7091817 we are blessed by the fact that our friend and neighbor is also our number one supplier of foreign oil
7091818 the amount of energy that you have to use to get that oil out of the ground is such that it actually creates a much greater impact on climate change as well as using much more energy than even traditional petroleum
7091819 if american mayors want to send their money to unstable undemocratic countries in the middle east instead of to canada that will be their call if they want to pay a premium for iranian saudi iraqi oil that will be their call
7091820 do you think americans are going to be paying a buck or a buck fifty more because somebody said that our carbon footprint is higher than oil from kazakhstan
7091821 you have to consider the environmental impact in a broader context
7091822 there is significant economic benefit from the development of oil sands the oil sands represent a very secure reliable long term source of supply to the united states people in the u s will have to judge whether that supply stacks up to other alternatives
7091823 they say no no were going to do research and really clean up our act well you cant give these guys permission to go ahead on the promise that something is going to happen in the future
7091824 for 40 years a couple of oil companies worked on the tar sands extraction process not its environmental impacts it was albertas massive expansion of tar sands leasing over the last few years ignoring serious unanswered environmental and public health concerns that created this mushrooming crisis
7091825 it would be the equivalent of several hundred exxon valdez oil spills
7091826 im just one of a chorus of people that are concerned
7091827 while we dont disagree that the resources should be exploited for human consumption we are saying it should be done in a way thats manageable responsible sustainable there are gross negligent environment and health issues being observed

7091831 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7091832 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7091833 his personnel file has junk in it its not worth considering
7091834 performance appraisals are not worth the paper they were written on
7091835 the system is flawed the system doesnt work well and in my opinion the system causes more problems
7091836 i dont agree that he should have had sex i dont agree that lt curtis breaux told him he should have sex
7091837 if you are asking if i had an orgasm yes it was a job sir
7091838 i didnt have pleasure doing this i was paid to do it
7091839 obviously you havent listened to the tapes yes i did
7091840 theres a glaring incident that i have to question having sex with someone who is not your wife
7091841 i have very high morals but they are being attacked because of something i did for the city

7091843 right now i feel like nothing ive been writing has a definitive point of aim i feel like you just need to keep writing until the writing itself just begins to take shape

7091856 these vessels are a key priority of the government of canada
7091857 however the government must ensure that canadian taxpayers receive the best value for their money
7091858 there is no arguing that the following 20 leaders have inspired us challenged us and in many ways caused us to rethink what it means to do church in todays culture
7091859 were all about building people up we re all about helping people reach their full potential we dont push some kind of religion all we push is joy and peace and victory through jesus christ our message every single week is through faith in god you can live an overcoming life of victory i believe thats the message this generation needs to hear weve heard a lot about the judgment of god and what we cant do and whats going to keep us out of heaven but its time people start hearing about the goodness of god about a god that loves them a god that believes in them a god that wants to help them thats our message here at lakewood
7091860 forget the fire and brimstone popular preacher joel osteen offers his listeners a simple upbeat message
7091861 your best life now 7 steps to living at your full potential
7091862 it sort of treats the bible as a collection of fortune cookies
7091863 if you claim the right verses then you can have health wealth and happiness
7091864 the miracle is in your mouth dare to speak those promises out loud confess them in the face of all contrary evidence when we say and confess his word god brings the miracle to pass
7091865 joel one day were going to live in a beautiful home just like that
7091866 a deadly cancer that is ravaging the body of christ
7091867 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
7091868 faith was the raw material substance that the spirit of god used to form the universe
7091869 father if it is your will take this cup away from me nevertheless not my will but yours be done
7091870 so start believing according to gods word then begin making faith and victory over your life if you dont like what you have in life then begin to change the way
7091871 a template for most all w f teachers and followers
7091872 kenyons view all sickness is essentially from satan and we can with the power of faith command satan and demand our healing
7091873 i command the author of sickness to leave my body
7091874 makes all the difference in the world just remember the tragedy of larry and lucky parker who bought the lie of w f doctrine and let their son die
7091875 god has to be given permission to work in this earth realm on behalf of man
7091876 it comes to faith theology truth is often stranger than fiction marilyn hickey for example teaches people to speak to their bodies
7091877 youre whole body why you just function so beautifully and so well why body you never have any problems youre a strong healthy body
7091878 when that happens the last thing you want to do is withdraw your faith and say well i guess it didnt work this time
7091879 decades christian science was the matriarch of the mind science family the mother church first church of christ scientist dominated the mind science movement more important in almost all respects than unity school of christianity mind science religious science divine science and their other siblings like new thought
7091880 then you can add that to the thesaurus and call it up when you need it rather than type it in every time
7091881 the terrorists can win and quite often do and its global anarchy it sums up the randomness of geo politics pretty well
7091882 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
7091883 its absurd a beard can conceal someones identity are the police going to start banning beards
7091884 what does this mean ah what does this mean ah
7091885 we also came away impressed by the dish network vip622s downconversion capability which is important for tv2 watchers and dvd archiving we recorded a few episodes of the sopranos from hbo hd to dvd and the downconverted standard def picture didnt have the issues weve noticed on some dvrs in fact it looked pretty good significantly better than the same episode on the standard def hbo2 channel in our experience the scientific atlanta 8300hd a common high def cable box does an inferior job downconverting hd shows to standard def

7091892 ich kann mir nicht erkl ren warum es einige nicht bis ins ziel geschafft haben
7091893 aber das hat mir die pole f r morgen gegeben ich hoffe wir k nnen sie ausnutzen das ist eine chance die man nicht immer bekommt bei mir war es heute richtig knapp denn ich kam erst 20 meter vor der linie an bruno vorbei
7091894 wir haben nach dem zeittraining die hinteren bremsen gewechselt und ich fand bei den schwierigen bedingungen zun chst keine richtige balance
7091895 ich bin ganz und gar nicht zufrieden mit dem auto bis morgen m ssen wir uns noch stark verbessern sonst werden wir keine chance haben momentan ist der abstand auf die spitze noch zu gro
7091896 bruno senna war hinter mir hat sich gedreht und ist mir in die front gekracht ich musste das ganze rennen mit einem schiefstehenden lenkrad fahren
7091897 da hat er wohl einen fehler gemacht den ich ihm aber nicht bel nehme denn morgen habe ich chancen auf den sieg
7091898 laut den berechnungen aus dem training h tte der sprit locker reichen m ssen wir hatten noch gen gend spielraum eingeplant
7091899 anscheinend hat er im laufe des rennens noch mehr sprit verbraucht ich kann es mir nicht anders erkl ren
7091900 aber immerhin hat das heutige chaos die meisterschaft nicht beeinflusst bruno und giorgio sind ohne punkte geblieben
7091901 sie kannten das problem und h tten reagieren m ssen entweder h tte die renndistanz zwei runden geringer sein m ssen oder man h tte etwas am motorenmanagement verstellen sollen
7091902 ohne das safety car w re kaum jemand bis ins ziel gekommen das war ein komisches rennen
7091903 mein tank war voll und ich habe nicht gepusht sondern das rennen kontrolliert ich bin nur ein paar runden schnell gefahren um die schnellste runde zu holen aber auch so w re ich liegengeblieben
7091904 aber ich einen vollen tank und damit die selben voraussetzungen wie die anderen ich frage mich warum sie es ins ziel geschafft haben ich aber nicht

7091912 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7091913 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7091914 the best possible pick that barack obama could have made
7091915 i think he brings a wealth of experience and he is a great campaigner and i think he is a very fine pick
7091916 joe biden has been fighting his entire career for the change that sen obama champions
7091917 he is a dedicated family man who has been an effective chairman of both the foreign affairs and judiciary committees has been a sage voice on many of the toughest foreign policy issues of our time and has long been a strong advocate for protecting american families and making our communities safer
7091918 you said i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
7091919 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7091920 aquele que d o que n o pode manter para ganhar o que n o pode perder n o um tolo
7091921 perhaps real world climate sensitivity is very much below the ipccs estimates perhaps therefore there is no climate crisis at all the correct policy approach to a non problem is to have the courage to do nothing
7091922 i was impressed by an hour long academic lecture which criticized claims about global warming and explained the implications of the physics of radiative transfer for climate change
7091923 to me the value of this paper lies in its dispassionate but ruthlessly clear exposition or rather expos of the ipccs method of evaluating climate sensitivity the detailed arguments in this paper and indeed in a large number of other scientific papers point up extensive errors including numerous projection errors of climate models as well as misleading statements by the ipcc consequently there are no rational grounds for believing either the ipcc or any other claims of dangerous anthropogenic global warming

7091935 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence
7091936 giving special attention to ninth grade is the first order of business
7091937 but then apply the same general principles to grades 10 through 12 so students arent faced with the same problems but just a year later
7091938 the flow is increasing as dramatically as it is because it is operating in a condition of impunity
7091939 the failure of the venezuelan government to go after this is a failure to be serious
7091940 frankly this has gotten to the point where theyre playing games
7091941 usually drugs is beyond a lot of other political differences we have a cooperative relationship with cuba
7091942 there just has been no willingness to establish that cooperation or re establish a working relationship
7091943 youve got to go after the criminals and youve got to go after those who are in positions of authority and are criminals
7091944 just do it its in your interest to do it

7092167 anak anak muda nu yang berada di kajian utan kayu islib itu cenderung menyalahkan kitab kitab klasik para ulama terdahulu mereka lebih menyukai pendapat pendapat hasan hanafi arkoun husain nasr dan sebagainya
7092168 padahal pemikir seperti hasan hanafi maupun arkoun dan lainnya itu sebelum menuangkan gagasan gagasannya itu saya yakin terlebih dahulu mempelajari kitab kitab klasik
7092169 tapi mengapa anak anak muda yang belum mendalami kitab kitab klasik itu malah justru mengkritik terlebih dahulu dan mengedepankan pendapatnya semata

7092173 organisasi misionaris ini semakin terorganisir dan sasaran mereka adalah mengkristenkan warga minang di seluruh indonesia dan malaysia
7092174 kelompok misionaris ini menilai program mereka berjalan lamban karena hanya mampu mengkristenkan seribu orang dalam lima tahun karenanya menurut informasi yang kita terima mereka pun kini bahkan sudah masuk ke sumbar agar program kristenisasi itu bisa berjalan lebih cepat
7092175 kita telah mencoba menelusuri ke berbagai pihak di sini kristen itu sendiri memiliki banyak sekte di mana setiap kita tanya mereka selalu mengelak dan satu sekte akan menunjuk sekte lain sebagai kelompok misionaris itu dan bukan mereka
7092176 tujuan utama kita adalah untuk bersama sama mengingatkan umat bahwa saat ini tengah berkeliaran kelompok kelompok misionaris yang dengan iming iming materi akan membujuk dan merayu umat agar mengikuti ajaran mereka
7092177 jika akidah dan keimanan kuat insyaallah mereka tidak akan berhasil membujuk umat agar berpindah agama

7092182 nissan does it very well so does cadillac ford does it with sync which adds a level of voice control scion has it in at least two of its cars
7092183 its no trick to get that in an expensive car but in a ford focus scion or moderately priced nissan it is

7092193 what began as the record of a fledgling culinary career now continues as one of recovery while i slowly regain a damaged sense of smell
7092194 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7092195 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7092196 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent
7092197 thats where we are today in the middle of a financial crisis with the economy sliding into recession with monetary policy at maximum easing and fiscal transfers impotent
7092198 more than a year into the most challenging financial crisis of our times we now face a complex and interlocking combination of rising inflation declining growth tightening credit conditions and widespread liquidity tensions
7092199 these adjustments will not be painless and ensuring that they take place in an orderly manner will pose substantial challenges for policymakers
7092200 most hospitals never pay their bills for months and most of the suppliers are too scared to create problems because they are threatened with losing their contracts
7092201 we are a small business and we do need cash flow
7092202 its frustrating having to chase money especially when i give them goods and they get money back on the same day
7092203 its the lowest of the low for a big government agency to make suppliers hold out for payment of services and goods that they have supplied
7092204 its mean and its jeopardising some of those small businesses that have to pay their bills and staff on time they struggle to stay afloat
7092205 now we have put them on pre pay so they pay in advance
7092206 they toro rosso have been coming and with that sort of horsepower you cant deal with it
7092207 their drivers are doing a good job you cant drive around here doing that sort of time without doing a good job thats clear but they do have a stronger package at the moment
7092208 we know the red bull is one of the quickest cars now and they toro rosso have the ferrari engine so obviously they have maybe an advantage there
7092209 we saw today two exactly same cars two red bulls and two toro rossos one was in pole position and one was out of q1 and q2 i think toro rosso now is clearly in front of red bull after the last couple of races
7092210 today i think he vettel did very well but also sebastien bourdais is in q3 and fighting for good positions so when the toro rosso is competitive we know that sebastian will be in the top positions
7092211 it was a great performance a great weekend and i think tomorrow they have a very high chance to score many points it is another competitor that we renault have now

7092265 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it

7092267 circumvents every rational practice in child welfare that im aware of
7092268 drafters will sometimes try to say as little as possible so they dont create ambiguity but drafters here succeeded in writing the law in such a limited fashion that the entire provision is ambiguous
7092269 the sad thing is we have plenty of other mechanisms for people to use
7092270 im not sure the safe haven law is really going to help in a majority of cases
7092271 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7092272 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
7092273 now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you gotta make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
7092274 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so that they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
7092275 what people are going through every single day here in america
7092276 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
7092277 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
7092278 the reality is that barack obamas plans to raise taxes and opposition to producing more energy here at home as gas prices skyrocket show hes completely out of touch with the concerns of average americans
7092279 maybe youre struggling just to pay the mortgage on your home
7092280 then again that same day when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember well its seven seven houses
7092281 and heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
7092282 from my perspective obama needs to introduce a game changer and fast before public opinion starts to gel around the notion that he is a phenom who deserves great respect but is not seasoned enough and would be too much of a risk in the oval office
7092283 its better for the player to get good cars free than to pay for bad cars
7092284 it doesnt matter the most im portant thing is that the indigenous get the best content at the lowest cost especially free regardless of who loses business or not as a result as long as content gets to the player its good
7092285 we had ups and we had downs just wanted to end on a high moment

7092338 the first thing that i would do is call in john kerry bob kerrey
7092339 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7092340 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7092341 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
7092342 im looking forward to working with these two distinguished new yorkers on the power authority board
7092343 the experience that they bring in key areas of law and finance will be a great asset to helping guide the power authority in carrying out its responsibilities as the nations largest state owned power organization

7092366 la idea como en bosnia es mantener unido a irak descentraliz ndolo d ndole a cada grupo tnico religioso kurdo sunita y chi ta espacio para ejercer sus propias relaciones
7092367 biden es conocido como un charlat n por su tendencia a formular declaraciones que lo meten en camisa de once varas
7092368 la elecci n de biden subraya ciertas debilidades que la campa a de obama busca corregir en momentos en que los sondeos muestras que su competici n con el senador republicano john mccain se torna m s disputada
7092369 algunas canas que pueden hacer parecer algo joven a obama
7092370 para una campa a que se enorgullece de su disciplina en materia de comunicaci n la opci n de biden incorpora al equipo un elemento fuerte de incertidumbre

7092433 id like to give you a piece of my mind
7092434 before you hire a company to build a house you would i expect insist on detailed plans showing what the finished structure was going to look like building a childs mind and character is what public schools do their justification for prematurely breaking family and neighborhood learning where is documentary evidence to prove this assumption that trained and certified professionals do it better than people who know and love them can there isnt any the cost in new york state for building a well schooled child in the year 2000 is 200 000 per body when lost interest is calculated that capital sum invested in the childs name over the past twelve years would have delivered a million dollars to each kid as a nest egg to compensate for having no school the original 200 000 is more than the average home in new york costs you wouldnt build a home without some idea what it would look like when finished but you are compelled to let a corps of perfect strangers tinker with your childs mind and personality without the foggiest idea what they want to do with it

7092466 i have to strictly follow the irca internal rules of the court of appeals
7092467 you are always emphasizing that you do everything by the book but here is the situation no one aside from the members of your division in fact should know the contents of your ponencia decision and here you are delivering a copy of your decision to a justice who is not a member of your division what is the point only for her reading
7092468 justice vidal was in my decision when we issued the tro
7092469 no longer a member of your division there was no more need to show to her a copy of your ponencia and yet you are showing to her a copy of your ponencia only for her reading pleasure
7092470 why did you not send also a copy of your ponencia to justice sabio for his reading pleasure also i know he also likes to read
7092471 never mind the seniority you are a justice of the court of appeals you have your own mind even if your senior is wrong and youre just a junior you tell him hes wrong im right after all you are a professor in up university of the philippines my goodness speak your mind never mind the seniority
7092472 it is a violation of the law for lawyers to follow up cases at the office of the justices they should respect the privacy of records of the case
7092473 the milf said the signing of the moa is just a formality
7092474 what would be the effect of our ruling to the milf
7092475 can you cite a case where a person has been prohibited from exercising a legal right
7092476 the problem here is that there is no consummated act yet why cant you wait for the signing of the agreement
7092477 we dont want to get the impression that only anti moa people reside in mindanao
7092478 the reason for the request was that there were interventions filed and we were not even asked to file comments that is part of due process we shouldnt be going to court unless we have inputs
7092479 on matter of due process when petition is filed against the law provides that the other party should be given the right to be heard the government is like any other ordinary citizen who should be given the chance to be heard which is missing on this case
7092480 the moa ad is flawed in the process just as it is flawed in its provisions what was lost in the process was an appreciation for legitimacy in a democracy that stems from winning consensus including the consent of the governed
7092481 the moa violates many provisions of the constitution which strangely enough the memorandum never mentions by name
7092482 its impossible that government lawyers wont be able to answer questions about the moa since they prepared it
7092483 you must indicate the nature of the pleadings parties case number and date filed for proper identification
7092484 in our master list we do indicate that but we will now do the same with our logbook as per your instruction
7092485 there is nothing in the rollo records of the case i cant find any transcript
7092486 it is the duty of the stenographer to attach the notes to the rollo of the case you do not find any
7092487 it appears that the rollo is always with justice roxas isnt it strange imagine if he has 300 cases and all the cases rollo are in his office how many justices in your division keep the rollo
7092488 imagine if the supreme court will ask for records of this case how can you comply if the rollo is with the justice what kind of performance is this and with so many pleadings submitted in this case all this is with justice roxas

7092508 its no trick to get that in an expensive car but in a ford focus scion or moderately priced nissan it is

7092515 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7092516 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7092517 today is a great day for democrats we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president this campaign is going to make history
7092518 i congratulate sen barack obama on his selection of my friend sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7092519 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7092520 i believe that joe biden is an excellent choice he is a man of experience and high integrity he will be a valuable running mate to sen obama
7092521 obama has spent millions on his change message in indiana biden has held onto a seat in the senate since 1972 how does that represent change
7092522 this is a terrific choice joe biden understands the challenges facing our country at home and abroad and his long history of bipartisanship in the senate will be a welcome asset he will be a tireless and enthusiastic partner for sen obama in the campaign and in the white house
7092523 sen biden will be a tremendous partner for sen obama and for michigan our state has been battered by the policies of the bush administration so it matters to us that sen biden has a long standing reputation of bringing real results that matter to americans it also matters that his track record on foreign policy will be invaluable to the new administration in helping to secure our nations place in the world
7092524 in choosing joe biden to join him on the ticket barack has struck olympic gold i competed against biden in the 88 campaign he is a bona fide expert on the judiciary and foreign policy he is always extremely well prepared is very smart a top level debater gutsy strong and has great personal integrity
7092525 i just had some subcutaneous fat injected into my penis to increase its girth so thats pretty good
7092526 hey barry they may cling bitterly but gosh darn it the rubes sure do vote
7092527 im sure the tragedy of this circumstance will hit all of those communities
7092528 he was very well qualified hed flown that plane for hundreds of hours hed flown this route many times
7092529 to end it with an olympic record after everything those guys have been through that shows you they care about representing america
7092530 they wanted to end it with a good dose of good ol american apple pie
7092531 so we used that as motivation we kept our heads high and we ran great
7092532 a lot of things happened in this olympics that we werent expecting
7092533 but well use that to build on i know next year at the world championships its going to be different
7092534 its a blessing for me to be out on this floor now participating in my fourth olympics and walking away with a fourth gold medal
7092535 weve said from day one that top to bottom we are a deep team
7092536 we just send wave after wave of players at you
7092537 we werent going to be the team to let lisa lose
7092538 you cant shoot less than 40 percent and expect to win gold medals
7092539 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7092540 biden has a record of raising taxes on hard working families voting to fund abortions with tax dollars and voting in favor of strict gun control
7092541 he was one of obamas harshest critics during the presidential primary slamming the junior illinois senator for cutting funds for our troops and agreeing to meet with the worlds worst tyrants
7092542 obama claims to be the change candidate but after four decades in the u s senate his running mate personifies washingtons failed status quo and in south carolina biden brings nothing to the ticket
7092543 saya masih lagi nak ikut hukum dan mahkamah syariah kalau sumpah untuk tuduhan jenayah kena jawab dengan siasatanlah
7092544 saya sudah buat salah dulu kepada rakyat saya mahu minta maaf kerana mengikut anwar dahulu
7092545 selepas main tenis saya tahu mana dia pergi sebab itu saya tidak terkejut
7092546 kita ada bukti yang kukuh untuk bawa mereka ke muka pengadilan jadi tidak timbul isu soal minta maaf atau sebaliknya
7092547 apabila orang lain kena terutama orang umno dia suka dan boleh terima tapi apabila orang dia yang kena kenapa tak boleh terima
7092548 mereka kata nak hapuskan rasuah tapi bila kita tangkap orang dia suruh bpr dan media minta maaf pula patut mereka kena bantu kita dan media
7092549 kebanyakan mereka adalah peguam sepatutnya mereka tahu dan biasa dengan istilah istilah ini kita bebaskan mereka dengan jaminan bpr ini bermakna kita boleh panggil mereka bila bila masa
7092550 sekarang kita sudah ambil keputusan untuk tuduh mereka di mahkamah setelah meneliti segala keterangan dan bukti yang ada
7092551 mereka memang tak faham kita akan siasat sesiapa saja kalau ada dakwaan berlakunya transaksi rasuah
7092552 saya tidak kisah sama ada dia menang atau tidak apa yang saya tahu saya mempunyai kerajaan untuk bekerja lebih keras dan mengetahui masalah rakyat
7092553 sebenarnya tak payah tunggu anwar rakyat lebih tahu kami mempunyai sokongan yang kuat rakyat tahu kami sedang bekerja sebagai kerajaan sehinggalah tiba pilihan raya umum ketika itu biarlah rakyat buat keputusan
7092554 objektif utama kami ialah untuk menawan dan mengadakan kongres kami di pwtc
7092555 saya percaya hanya anwar boleh menjadi orang tengah antara pas dan dap
7092556 beliau bukan lagi anwar yang kita pernah kritik sebelum ini beliau kini anwar yang sudah berubah dan saya percaya kepadanya
7092557 sudah jelas bahawa rakyat mahukan perubahan pada pilihan raya umum lepas dan dap menegaskan perubahan yang dilakukan perlu berteraskan prinsip ini

7092572 mccains fundamental problem is theres only one way home for him replicate the bush electoral victory state by state
7092573 the fundamental truth remains that this race is extremely tight mccain is in strong position in ohio and florida two states that have been critical for republican victories and hes better positioned today in michigan than the president was in either 2000 or 2004

7092593 mi piacerebbe che fosse messa in risalto la bellezza sia fisica che spirituale delle suore ha detto alladnkronos padre rungi stiamo parlando di persone molto preparate che operano nel sociale dove oltre alla bellezza spirituale ma per avere visibilit c anche bisogno di una bella presenza
7092594 lidea mi venuta parlando con alcune sorelle con le quali stavo pregando sulla spiaggia di mondragone ha spiegato il prete casertano eravamo in preghiera con turisti e villeggianti a dimostrazione di quanto sia aperta la mentalit di queste suore
7092595 si tratta di uniniziativa che sfrutta le potenzialit del web ha sottolineato padre rungi infatti verr gestita interamente su internet
7092596 gli stessi utenti del web il contatto non sar diretto ma online
7092597 e importante ha aggiunto don rungi sfruttare tutte le potenzialit del web infatti lassociazionismo cattolico molto attivo in questo campo daltronde ormai il modo migliore per poter mediare con i giovani
7092598 vorrei che si sfatasse il mito della suora vecchia trascurata e cattiva ha spiegato padre rungi ce ne sono tante soprattutto quelle che fanno formazione con i giovani che sono estremamente attive e preparate devono essere soprattutto al passo coi tempi visto che hanno a che fare con ragazzi
7092599 ho ricevuto anche qualche mail di dissenso ha ammesso padre rungi di cristiani che non hanno colto lo spirito di evangelizzazione insito in questa idea purtroppo alcune persone hanno una mentalit ancora chiusa e pensano che si debbano utilizzare solo i media tradizionali

7092603 but some of the guests do kind of look at them like what in the world
7092604 but with star trek theres one thing to relate it to
7092605 if youre a fur theres no one thing to relate it to people cant make sense of it
7092606 a lot of the misunderstanding comes from career minded adults asking why are people this age doing this
7092607 these are the only friends we had when we were growing up
7092608 some people crack open a beer some people sit in front of the tv
7092609 my other half happens to be a furry and our outlook on it is pretty much the same
7092610 you can call it a lifestyle its part of who we are it gives us an escape from the daily bs and rigmarole
7092611 coming up i had a hard life lions were always strong and dominant they helped me get through a lot of troubles just kept me strong
7092612 its basically how much flak are you willing to take
7092613 they think theres a very large sex thing going on and theres not
7092614 it would be a lie to say theres not an adult aspect to it

7092616 how do i reconcile being a furry and a christian its pretty difficult
7092617 i dont hide it that im a furry within my church and im more involved with my ministry than i am as a furry
7092618 its one of the few times you can say you have a family thats 100 percent accepting of who you are
7092619 you can feel free to be yourself without fear of being persecuted by other people
7092620 were not obsessed to the point where we dont function outside of it
7092621 it just makes you feel like the animal for a short time
7092622 s amp p tracks 7 000 companies so the vast bulk are still either maintaining or raising their dividends
7092623 the market is sending a signal about sustainability at that point
7092624 a lot of people are still under the rubble we have recovered eight bodies
7092625 most hospitals never pay their bills for months and most of the suppliers are too scared to create problems because they are threatened with losing their contracts
7092626 we are a small business and we do need cash flow
7092627 its frustrating having to chase money especially when i give them goods and they get money back on the same day
7092628 its the lowest of the low for a big government agency to make suppliers hold out for payment of services and goods that they have supplied
7092629 its mean and its jeopardising some of those small businesses that have to pay their bills and staff on time they struggle to stay afloat
7092630 now we have put them on pre pay so they pay in advance
7092631 solitude trying to stay in control of things always trying to do right

7092635 but with star trek theres one thing to relate it to
7092636 if youre a fur theres no one thing to relate it to people cant make sense of it
7092637 a lot of the misunderstanding comes from career minded adults asking why are people this age doing this
7092638 these are the only friends we had when we were growing up
7092639 some people crack open a beer some people sit in front of the tv
7092640 my other half happens to be a furry and our outlook on it is pretty much the same
7092641 you can call it a lifestyle its part of who we are it gives us an escape from the daily bs and rigmarole
7092642 coming up i had a hard life lions were always strong and dominant they helped me get through a lot of troubles just kept me strong
7092643 its basically how much flak are you willing to take
7092644 they think theres a very large sex thing going on and theres not
7092645 it would be a lie to say theres not an adult aspect to it
7092646 but its not a religion or an occult group theres no idols to worship we leave religion out of it completely

7092660 the development time line for the 496 and 596 was three years and we wanted to address aero weight stiffness and comfort into a package that would work well for triathlon
7092661 its been an emerging market for us so lot of time was put into creating this frame there is no afterthought aerodynamics has become a key aspect of our triathlon frames and we proudly take a slightly different approach
7092662 without a clear exit path for that air we found you get a high degree of turbulence
7092663 it goes against conventional wisdom but that comes from thinking when looking at the bike statically the story changes with a spinning wheel
7092664 when jaja had that bike for three weeks before nice he called and said he regrets he didnt have such a bike when he was racing he couldnt explain but said it just amazed him it was something he felt in the bike
7092665 patrick vernay went to roth and won he said normally he couldnt stay with the other guys on the bike he told us he dedicated his victory to the bike ive heard of dedicated a race to your spouse or dying aunt but a bike it must be damn good
7092666 now you have a universal crankset that will work for everybody

7092710 youre getting national security experience youre getting enthusiasm and you hope youre getting some help in those white working class blue collar towns where barack obama needs help
7092711 the rap on him is that he talks too long his speeches dont end and occasionally he goes off the reservation
7092712 has a personal story as well triumph over tragedy he brings depth to this ticket
7092713 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook
7092714 an editorial in the los angeles times said in addition to his uncontrolled verbosity biden is a gaffe machine can you reassure voters in this country that you would have the discipline you would need on the world stage senator
7092715 biden can help a lot by first reassuring and even more important putting bush and mccain on trial and showing that barack obama is change thats what i think well see joe biden doing over the next couple of months
7092716 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy

7092728 es zeugt vom selbstvertrauen und unserer klasse dass wir noch einmal zur ckgekommen sind
7092729 dass das tor so sp t gefallen ist war vielleicht etwas gl cklich aber wir sind so leicht nicht zu schlagen
7092730 wir waren berhaupt nicht pr sent und nicht aggressiv wir sind fast nur hinterhergelaufen und haben die torchancen nicht genutzt
7092731 wir haben vor allem in der ersten halbzeit aggressiv gespielt den ball laufen lassen und das spiel von stuttgart unterbunden

7092738 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee senator obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7092739 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7092740 the best possible pick that barack obama could have made
7092741 i think he brings a wealth of experience and he is a great campaigner and i think he is a very fine pick
7092742 joe biden has been fighting his entire career for the change that sen obama champions
7092743 he is a dedicated family man who has been an effective chairman of both the foreign affairs and judiciary committees has been a sage voice on many of the toughest foreign policy issues of our time and has long been a strong advocate for protecting american families and making our communities safer
7092744 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7092745 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7092746 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7092747 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7092748 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7092749 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

7092817 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7092818 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7092819 biden has a way with words using thousands of them when ten would do and five would be perfect thus the law of averages is against him the chances of a gaffe increase proportionately with the number of words employed
7092820 the only thing standing between joe biden and the presidency is his mouth that though is no small matter it is a himalayan barrier a sahara of a handicap a summers day in death valley a winters night at the pole either one an endless list of metaphors intended to show you both the immensity of the problem and to illustrate it with the op ed version of excess this alas is joe biden

7092822 the us mint has suspended sales of american eagle gold coins
7092823 the suspension is overwhelming evidence that the futures contract price of gold on the commodities exchanges is substantially below the physical market price and that indeed the commodities exchanges are being used as gata long has maintained as part of a massive scheme of manipulation of the precious metals currency and bond markets
7092824 the western central banks desperate to prop up a corrupt and tottering financial system have put gold so much on sale that even the us mint cant find any now
7092825 regardless of why silver went down by so much so fast why did it go down at all
7092826 many people agree there is a shortage of retail investor silver but they get confused by the lower price they think a lower price means more silver must have come into the market
7092827 well if one looks at the classical supply demand dynamic where the supply curve meeting the demand curve determines the price then yes silver supply must have come onto the market to swamp demand making the price go down thats the way things work everybody knows that do i look like i am stupid or something is that what you are saying youre saying im stupid like i dont understand supply and demand or something is that what you are saying punk
7092828 wrong o thats how all markets work price equilibrates demand and supply so that they equal each other
7092829 our markets are affected by paper silver futures contracts and very few people ever attempt to take delivery of that silver they buy it on leverage for the investment returns not for real silver so some people can sell silver promises to excess and never deliver and if they sell more paper silver than exists that can manipulate the price
7092830 the disconnect between supply and demand in gold amp silver markets
7092831 western markets are with the exception of some fabrication and industrial demand almost 90 paper based
7092832 managing deliveries of physical gold and silver to artificially reduce the quantities delivered

7092838 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7092839 senator bidens well known commitment to his catholic faith has inspired his advocacy on issues such as genocide universal health care education workers rights and violence against women there are those especially involved in south dakotas sweeping task force report organizations of women who have suffered from abortion but back to catholics united we are optimistic that senator bidens history of seeking practical means of addressing abortion will help move our nation beyond the divisive acrimonious and unproductive debate that has come to surround the issue what makes it divisive acrimonious and unproductive would make for a good examination senator biden accepts his churchs teachings on human life and can work to advance these teachings in ways that americans of all political persuasions can support thats a contradiction if sen biden accepted his churchs teachings on human life he could not support abortion catholics united is especially hopeful that operatives on the far right will refrain from using senator bidens faith and the teachings of the catholic church as political weapons in the coming campaign faith and values should be used to unite americans behind solutions to the key challenges of this age war poverty lack of health care and a looming climate crisis and not as partisan wedges to divide voters

7092917 the bottom line here is if regime change is the operative element of this administrations policy in iran you are never going to get to the point where you end up with a diplomatic solution there may be no diplomatic solution in the end thats possible we may have crossed the line or they may have crossed the line while we fool around with this youre going to see japan go nuclear and youre going to see china react to japan going nuclear and youre going to see a chain of events set in motion that are going to be significantly damaging to the next generation of americans and so it seems to me we should get off this wicket of suggesting that we wont talk i mean what are we afraid of in talking

7092919 there has never been progress in the middle east without the united states acting as a catalyst the fact of the matter is that our good offices are important the fact as the matter is that i would not do anything that i did not coordinate with the israeli government i would not pretend to be anything other than we are arabs know where we are and all they want to know is that we are going to in fact be blanced and fair about it i think we can still establish that my point is that we should have some very important person on the ground there ready to explore all the initiatives any serious person in the government thinks it might be worth considering we should be a catalyst here
7092920 the single most important thing we could do for israel right now is to get a political settlement in iraq that changes the dynamic frees up resources for us frees up our capability and changes the whole game but we dont seem to have anyone in this administration that can connect the dots
7092921 it seems to me what we have to do is continue to push to see if we can hold this coalition together to increase gradual sanctions on iran without that we dont have a whole lot of options here this is a test for the diplomacy this is a test for the united nations if it fails then what were going to have to do is begin to come up with a serious containment policy here
7092922 because of our lack of a prevention strategy were left with no option here in my view but to support israel in what is a totally legitimate self defense effort

7093007 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7093008 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
7093009 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs
7093010 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
7093011 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7093012 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7093013 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7093014 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7093015 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
7093016 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
7093017 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7093018 sen obama said he would do everything possible to end the war in iraq and emphasized the need for a political solution yet he failed to show up to vote for sen bidens critical amendment to provide a political solution in iraq
7093019 frankly i think im more qualified than other candidates and the issues facing the american public are all in my wheelbarrow
7093020 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
7093021 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
7093022 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
7093023 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
7093024 the threat saddam hussein presented was that if saddam was left unfettered which i said during that period for the next five years with sanctions lifted and billions of dollars into his coffers then i believed he had the ability to acquire a tactical nuclear weapon not by building it by purchasing it
7093025 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7093026 i mean the truth of the matter is that that the americas this administrations policy and the surge are a failure and that the surge which was supposed to stop sectarian violence and long enough to give political reconciliation theres been no political reconciliation the reality is that although there has been some mild progress on the security front there is in fact no no real security in baghdad and or in anbar province where i was dealing with the most serious problem sectarian violence sectarian violence is as strong and as solid and as serious a problem as it was before the surge started
7093027 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
7093028 if he surges another 20 30 or whatever number hes going to into baghdad itll be a tragic mistake in my view but as a practical matter theres no way to say mr
7093029 unless we fundamentally change the rotation dates and fundamentally change how many members of the national guard were calling up itll be virtually impossible to maintain 150 000 folks this year

7093040 el revolucionario proletario considera a los obreros chinos como su ej rcito para el d a de hoy o para el de ma ana el funcionario aventurero se sit a por encima de todas las clases de la naci n china se cree llamado a dominar decidir mandar independientemente de las relaciones internas de las fuerzas que existen en china

7093056 we couldnt just cover he said this she said that
7093057 i think americans get carried away by that but it doesnt work with european audiences we try to explain the consequences trying to be constructive
7093058 even if you look at things without racism history has told you that whenever a white man and a black man meet its the white man that has more power
7093059 now you see barack obama meeting with european authorities and he could become the most powerful man in the world in the united states it might not be so shocking but in europe its revolutionary
7093060 consequently they have an added responsibility to make sure that both candidates are playing on a level field
7093061 we have covered more about obama i know its a mistake and i try to be more fair

7093115 the medicare drug benefit has produced tangible relief for millions of people despite the unusual coverage gap that was created to make the benefit fit within budget constraints
7093116 but if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions

7093136 honesty bidens most notorious feature is his mouth but in his youth he had a stutter as a freshman in high school he was exempted from public speaking because of his disability and was ridiculed by teachers and peers his nickname was dash because of his inability to finish a sentence he developed an odd smile as a way to relax his facial muscles it still shows up while hes speaking today and hes spent his adulthood making up for any comments that may have gone unmade during his youth today bidens conversational style is tiresome to some but it has one outstanding feature he is direct no matter who you are he tells you exactly what he thinks before he tells it to you a second third and fourth time
7093137 this year has not gone like last year at all
7093138 i thought i was going to come in here and have a good year but this is part of the game it is better this happened early in my career early in the season im better now and im getting better every time
7093139 the command wasnt there the sink wasnt there the location wasnt there thats a bad combination for a closer
7093140 he went through a very painful experience a lot of adversity that being said hes worked himself into a very good spot being very productive setting up in front of setup man taylor buchholz i would not be hesitant if closer brian fuentes was down for him to close again its his second year lets not lose sight of that
7093141 its always possible for young players to think there is going to be more to the equation than what there was
7093142 what i have told guys for years is that i learned the hard way myself the enemy of good is great if you want to go from good to great it does not happen in a year more often than not it takes you away from being good in the immediate future you get to be great by being good for a long time
7093143 through it all i understood what was happening and im staying positive
7093144 now i just have to keep going forward and doing the work
7093145 ive learned that if i feel bad on the mound i am going to do badly i know that how i work off the field carries over to how i do in the games my concentration is a lot better i am staying confident all of the time my focus is on doing my work and not on what happened or what is going to happen
7093146 where he is now to where he was in april says a lot about this kids desire and his makeup

7093151 i think its a good selection i think he brings a lot of stature to the ticket he certainly brings foreign policy and defense policy qualifications or experience that obama doesnt necessarily have given his short tenure in the senate
7093152 i am very pleased with the pick of senator biden i think he is a very strong compliment to senator obamas skill set
7093153 that was a pretty strong field for us between biden and chet edwards and even evan bayh and chuck hagel and it just kinda became a numbers game at that point
7093154 he let me in on this some time ago we were pushing him as hard as we could
7093155 really hit it off personally when we got them together
7093156 both of them have a real strong kind of bond on what to do about veterans
7093157 chets stock among his colleagues i think among his constituents among people who are involved or watch the national policy scene like the media and others has gone up considerably as a result of this as it should
7093158 the actions of everyone that day not just torres proved we were trained and ready for this deployment

7093161 she would describe an experiment and say thanks to allah it turned out well
7093162 what we have learned from her is that she was in custody for over five years
7093163 i have no doubt that there really are real terrorists out there but she isnt one of them
7093164 shes a dangerous person with a lot of ability and the investigation will show how far along she may have been with any plot
7093165 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
7093166 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
7093167 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
7093168 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
7093169 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
7093170 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
7093171 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
7093172 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
7093173 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
7093174 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
7093175 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
7093176 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence
7093177 i aint pro human because all humans aint pro black
7093178 boy scout huh you call yourself a goddam boy scout why you wouldnt make a pimple on a real boy scouts ass

7093183 hey mike remember that girl you talked to at the hospital the one that got beat up and walked in with your buddy from the candy store

7093186 i just have to figure what ill put on the peak
7093187 i didnt give melissa what she really needed i guess
7093188 somebody told me something like that once that kids can skip out of their house because of the tension there and the pressure it puts on them
7093189 who was in the same a street kid who lived in a pretty bad neighborhood but still managed to take care of herself and a lot people around her

7093198 you get some rest you keep coming in here theyre gonna have to name the wing after you
7093199 tell nurse bridges thanks and ask her if i can get another favor
7093200 just ask her if she would keep willimina here for a while um until
7093201 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time

7093203 i admire the jonas brothers because they are all so down to earth and all of them really remember where they come from and they stay grounded unlike alot of other famous people
7093204 todays commercial kitchens are being squeezed by high operating costs driven by energy prices and a reduction in discretionary spending by consumers
7093205 our customers wanted a way to reduce their operating costs while becoming more ecologically responsible which in turn would make their establishment more appealing to patrons the program we developed allows our customers to achieve these goals while putting them further down the path toward other types of certifications

7093209 just remember four things when you go into the voting booth this november 1 barack hussein
7093210 1 barack hussein obama lets his own brother starve in africa when obama makes millions of dollars and lives in luxury family values anyone
7093211 2 barack hussein obama doesnt know when life begins according to him whose to say life begins at birth let alone conception get ready for legal infanticide dont like how your baby looks after birth go ahead and kill it obama supports this and has voted to allow babies to be killed after they are born
7093212 seriously look at the facts mccain is probably the least qualified person in the history of the united states on paper
7093213 i am a zionist you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
7093214 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7093215 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7093216 it appears pirates are still trying to hijack ships in the location
7093217 well have to gain trust over a period of time and thats what were going to try to do
7093218 the killing sprees that seem to be enjoyed by the winnipeg police service
7093219 when theres comments that we enjoy a killing spree that to me is very disappointing
7093220 i think the majority of the public supports the police
7093221 we will be seeking more specific information about why he was picked up and held and about his experience during his incarceration
7093222 all the languages of heteroglossia are specific points of view on the world forms for conceptualizing the world in words specificworldviews each characterized by its own objects meanings and values bakhtin
7093223 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7093224 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7093225 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7093226 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7093227 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7093228 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7093229 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7093230 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7093231 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7093232 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7093233 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7093234 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7093235 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7093236 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7093237 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7093238 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7093239 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7093240 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7093241 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7093242 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7093243 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7093244 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7093245 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7093246 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7093247 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7093248 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7093249 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7093250 who are open to doing something on the production side
7093251 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7093252 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7093253 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7093254 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7093255 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7093256 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7093257 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7093258 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7093259 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7093260 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7093261 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7093262 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7093263 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7093264 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

7093272 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7093273 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7093274 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7093275 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7093276 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7093277 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7093278 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7093279 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7093280 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7093281 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7093282 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7093283 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7093284 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7093285 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7093286 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7093287 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7093288 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7093289 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7093290 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7093291 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7093292 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7093293 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7093294 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7093295 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7093296 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7093297 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7093298 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7093299 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7093300 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7093301 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7093302 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7093303 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7093304 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7093305 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7093306 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7093307 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7093308 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7093309 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7093310 im gonna get this guy in a room and i want you to make a positive identification do you think you can do that for me

7093362 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7093363 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history

7093407 un partido que en las anteriores elecciones obtuvo un mill n de votos es una fuerza pol tica con futuro
7093408 el momento sea complicado y dif cil como consecuencia de esos resultados electorales
7093409 estoy convencido de que superaremos esta situaci n y surgir una formaci n con fuerza proyecci n y futuro
7093410 unitario una direcci n lo m s legitimada posible y un coordinador con la mayor fuerza
7093411 desde euskadi trabajaremos en esa direcci n con esos objetivos y esas claves porque necesitamos un referente en el estado que nos acompa e y con el que trabajar en la construcci n de un estado solidario federal y republicano
7093412 tenemos muchos nombres asegur no uno sino varios por lo que alternativas habr y se trata de buscar el mayor consenso
7093413 porque ser a la mejor manera de quemar sus nombres
7093414 a partir de septiembre pronostic todo este debate comenzar a surgir con m s fuerza
7093415 tenemos que hacer esfuerzos por acordar esos censos unos censos transparentes que nos hagan enfrentar a una asamblea normalizada
7093416 no puede ser que algunas federaciones hayan presentado censos inflados sin el suficiente soporte y rigor como para dar a entender que estamos ante una afiliaci n que se corresponde con la realidad
7093417 tratan de buscar tener ventajas en la asamblea con una obtenci n de mayores delegados para obtener mayor correlaci n de fuerzas mientras no despejemos bien esa fase no tendremos un horizonte despejado para la asamblea y para que sta se haga con garant as democr ticas
7093418 un referente fundamental un patrimonio del partido y lo seguir siendo en los pr ximos tiempos
7093419 se enfrent a unas elecciones muy dif ciles permiti que tuvi ramos grupo parlamentario en la anterior legislatura y ha sido capaz de dar imagen de una fuerza pol tica til capaz de incidir en las pol ticas de forma constructiva
7093420 se han ubicado en claves que corresponden a las posiciones de otras fuerzas pol ticas
7093421 sobre censos inflados es f cil tener mayor as pero hay que obtenerlas sobre censos reales que se ajusten a la afiliaci n en cada federaci n y algunos no se ajustan a las afiliaciones reales
7093422 alimentar pol micas que otros ya van a alimentar y s lo hacen da o a la formaci n

7093426 he made a set of compromises all in a row that freaked people out on the progressive side of the party
7093427 is a narrative about his life that ties his life to his positions
7093428 twenty years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen just doesnt make you a better commander in chief
7093429 we dont need as a commander in chief a war hero johns a war hero we need someone with some wisdom
7093430 youre getting national security experience youre getting enthusiasm and you hope youre getting some help in those white working class blue collar towns where barack obama needs help
7093431 the rap on him is that he talks too long his speeches dont end and occasionally he goes off the reservation
7093432 has a personal story as well triumph over tragedy he brings depth to this ticket
7093433 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook
7093434 an editorial in the los angeles times said in addition to his uncontrolled verbosity biden is a gaffe machine can you reassure voters in this country that you would have the discipline you would need on the world stage senator
7093435 biden can help a lot by first reassuring and even more important putting bush and mccain on trial and showing that barack obama is change thats what i think well see joe biden doing over the next couple of months
7093436 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7093437 great canadian mobile giveaway and had over 250 people sent in comments and e mails to answer our skill testing question
7093438 we are persistent and resiliant than those in other countries
7093439 we needed this after the year weve had no doubt about that all the whelen engineering guys have been working so hard to get this no 30 corvette up front the first half of the season was a disaster and the way we view it is the second half of the season is the start of our season road america was a good finish and here we are at mosport where the corvettes have always done well we won here last year so i feel comfortable the whelen corvette is doing great and were hoping for a repeat of last year
7093440 it certainly helped that the qualifying ended early because i think there were cars some cars that would have been faster than i was
7093441 i was counting down the time with the guys on the radio saying is it done
7093442 i will say that a longtime x men villain has his sinster hands in it
7093443 im partial to nightcrawler ever since i first encountered him fighting spider man in the pages of amazing spider man 161
7093444 like a lot of other people ive always liked wolverine as well
7093445 im partial to female characters and rogue is probably my favorite
7093446 the idea that she cant touch anyone or if she does she absorbs all their memories and powers is terrific like have nothing or take all in any relationship i have to say im quite new to the x men though and the more i discover about them the more it becomes difficult to choose on a graphic point of view i have to agree with chris nightcrawler is awesome drawing the blob was so much fun as for spider man villains i choose j jonah jameson and the prowler i really liked him as a kid
7093447 we looked for eras in which both spidey and the x men were going through interesting events in their lives
7093448 for example kravens last hunt took place right around the time of the mutant massacre so that was a logical time period to use and the ben reilly clone saga coincided with the time wolverine had been stripped of his adamantium and was using bone claws so we felt it would be interesting to explore what that did to the dynamic our first issue takes place just after x men v1 66 which is also when spidey was in the midst of the classic john romita gwen stacy era i think mario would have gone on a hunger strike if we didnt get gwen in there as for the last issue im being a bit secretive about that for now but its set in modern times
7093449 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7093450 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7093451 obama is trying to compensate for his lack of national security creds
7093452 he picked joe lieberman to compensate for gores bill clinton problem

7093454 she knew early on that i had virtually not much in common with the rockefeller family
7093455 referred to me as having been descended from john d rockefeller and such whenever it was to her advantage
7093456 she usually did so in an understated way calling special attention to it by keeping it extra quiet
7093457 sort of psst shes married to a rockefeller its like saying you went to harvard it opens doors
7093458 from what ive heard lately it might not be but as far as i know its my name

7093461 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7093462 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7093463 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent
7093464 thats where we are today in the middle of a financial crisis with the economy sliding into recession with monetary policy at maximum easing and fiscal transfers impotent
7093465 more than a year into the most challenging financial crisis of our times we now face a complex and interlocking combination of rising inflation declining growth tightening credit conditions and widespread liquidity tensions
7093466 these adjustments will not be painless and ensuring that they take place in an orderly manner will pose substantial challenges for policymakers
7093467 you know how to get to work already but cant always navigate around traffic
7093468 there are broadcast channels where you can listen to the traffic audibly with this you can listen to music and see the traffic info pop up this will show red yellow or green lines to show the flow of traffic as it happens
7093469 that gives an indication that its not just cadillac and lexus that offers this

7093471 nissan does it very well so does cadillac ford does it with sync which adds a level of voice control scion has it in at least two of its cars
7093472 its no trick to get that in an expensive car but in a ford focus scion or moderately priced nissan it is

7093478 obama recognized the gap on national security and he recognized the need to get tougher on mccain and he chose the guy who can most quickly help him on both counts
7093479 there should be no doubt that this is going to be a rough campaign from here on out and biden knows how to fight im sure that was a strong consideration
7093480 this is an admission by barack obama that he doesnt have the experience to be president more than a vice president hes looking for a hand holder or a tutor
7093481 his brain is an asset but his mouth is a major liability when the latter starts trumping the former and it inevitably will the democrats will have a problem on their hands

7093514 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up

7093586 the obama desire to get out and the mccain desire to succeed could be coming together in the form of an ability to get out while succeeding
7093587 the simple truth is that we do not have sufficient forces in iraq to meet our military objectives
7093588 facts have to affect your decision making and over the course of 16 months things are going to constantly change
7093589 he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq even today with victory in sight

7093591 this idea that the public sector would move in and try to encourage alternative scheduling based on the idea of reducing traffic congestion reducing pollution most find it an appropriate time because of the price of gas
7093592 were in the midst of a very different sort of work world than we used to be were competing globally and it makes sense to have more flexibility more sense to have a framework where were going to be able to adjust in a hypercompetitive world
7093593 we couldnt and we havent found any identification showing they are taliban
7093594 the coalition forces have made mistakes so many times and killed so many civilians we are asking president karzai to come here
7093595 on such a serious allegation as this one we have to look into it
7093596 were just trying to get to the bottom of this
7093597 i thought we had scored a perfectly good goal which was chalked off and also palace goalkeeper julian speroni made some top class saves
7093598 in the first half we both looked nervous palace are looking to score their first goal but we started well in the second half and then the sending offs came along
7093599 we showed some application and the effort was there but credit to palace because they defended with their lives
7093600 well not get carried away because its only two games
7093601 but it was one of those games where paul ince was on a high after the result last weekend it was his first home game hes just signed santa cruz on a new contract so there was a little bit of momentum with blackburn and it was important we got something
7093602 we could have gone on to win the game and whether that would have been fair or unfair doesnt matter we could have won it
7093603 im ecstatic with a point to tell you the truth
7093604 its a great point on our travels and if we continue with that kind of passion drive commitment togetherness well be okay this year
7093605 but it does come down to that little bit of quality in the final third which you pay a lot of money for
7093606 you spy on americans for me and ill make sure you dont have to pay any taxes
7093607 just remember four things when you go into the voting booth this november 1 barack hussein
7093608 1 barack hussein obama lets his own brother starve in africa when obama makes millions of dollars and lives in luxury family values anyone
7093609 2 barack hussein obama doesnt know when life begins according to him whose to say life begins at birth let alone conception get ready for legal infanticide dont like how your baby looks after birth go ahead and kill it obama supports this and has voted to allow babies to be killed after they are born
7093610 seriously look at the facts mccain is probably the least qualified person in the history of the united states on paper
7093611 why do so many liberals on digg always resort to hyperbole cant put forth a simple argument based upon facts
7093612 i am a zionist you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
7093613 players have been away on international duty and the performance wasnt the best
7093614 ive been a player and ive been away with england many times and it is hard to get going again
7093615 i had about an hour with my players yesterday and i think it showed in the second half we played into hulls hands
7093616 but we did it to everton last week so it evens itself out in the end
7093617 to be fair when you go ahead theyve got to start coming out and playing and that probably opens things out for us to go further ahead
7093618 but to concede straight after our goal was really really disappointing defensively we werent at the races
7093619 paul robinson could do nothing about it the header could have gone anywhere but it goes in off the post
7093620 but overall they deserved their point and could even have won it at the end
7093621 it was an exciting game to be fair and were always trying to win it and make it exciting for people
7093622 but sometimes and ive said this to the lads when youre tired and you know youre tired its important you have a bank of four and another bank of four and be hard to beat
7093623 i have watched the dvd and can not understand how the referee came to his decision
7093624 i have been to see the ref and given him my point of view
7093625 i dont want to get into trouble over this but it was a case of two players rightly competing for the ball
7093626 this is going to be a long hard season for us and we need to be more ruthless
7093627 people in this division punish your mistakes but what we are doing is not punishing their mistakes
7093628 you only have to look at the quality available to clubs like sheffield united as against the smaller clubs like ourselves
7093629 however i thought we more than matched them going forwards and played some good football at times
7093630 i have no doubt it was a penalty there was a lot of pushing and shoving at the corner and the ref says he saw a shirt being pulled
7093631 i thought this was a good result for us because blackpool are a workman like side and this is a difficult place to come to
7093632 i thought we controlled the game well and got players forward in numbers
7093633 we have some good players like jon stead and james beattie coming back after injury so there is pressure on places and that is what i want
7093634 why would they call it building 7 if it were the 3rd building to fall
7093635 why would they call it building 7 if it were the 3rd building to fall
7093636 of course you always hoped it would happen but now its a reality its fantastic for hull
7093637 there was so much talk about it being the biggest place never to have had a top flight team so its wonderful for the city and the club that they have made it
7093638 near the end of my time there just before i went to nottingham forest there were starting to be some financial difficulties and a couple of years after that it started to get really bad and then at one point the gates were closed
7093639 sometimes it takes adversity for a club to go through a transition and get success everybody knew the potential of the fan base and it was a matter of putting a lot of things in place which they did and it took off
7093640 the new stadium brought in a lot of new fans we went from something like 4 000 at boothferry park to 20 000 at the kc stadium it had an effect on the team and the whole city
7093641 i went back there recently and walked round boothferry park which was a bit eery and sad in many ways
7093642 its changed in many ways since i was there but its a lovely club and i spent a lot of my time there and im really pleased for the players
7093643 it was the best club i have ever been at when i went from hull to nottingham forest i said to myself it doesnt get any better than this but then when i went to blackburn it was a totally different mindset again
7093644 they had just started the new training ground and the academy and the players were superb we had two fantastic goalkeepers in alan kelly and john filan and it was a great place to be
7093645 i always look back at that and when people say which was the best club i played at and i always say blackburn
7093646 i have spoken to a few people who played under him at macclesfield and mk dons and they always speak highly of the training and the way he did things so perhaps its no coincidence that hes been successful wherever hes been
7093647 indeed i count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing christ jesus my lord
7093648 i press on to make it my own because christ jesus has made me his own i press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of god in christ jesus
7093649 would you be satisfied in heaven if jesus wasnt there
7093650 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularised by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer
7093651 young women tend to express egalitarian values and dislike the traditionalism and hierarchies they imagine are integral to the church
7093652 womens ordination as priests and now bishops has dominated debate and headlines but while looking at women in the pulpit we have taken our eyes off the pews where a shift with more consequences for the churchs survival is underway
7093653 gone are the days when the mother was at home during the day and had time to visit the churchs coffee mornings and mother and toddler groups
7093654 with the pressures women face churches must adapt to make themselves more accessible
7093655 what this research reveals is that a lot of people are put off by traditional stances and attitudes we still have a long way to go before women particularly young women feel as included in the church as men do
7093656 im absolutely convinced that when we have women as bishops that it will send out a very clear message that women are as valued as much as men
7093657 i hadnt the slightest desire to get into any sort of political debate i was 0 for 16
7093658 anything to make me look odd is to their advantage
7093659 i dont want to fuel anything id rather not talk about it
7093660 i had high heels on and i just couldnt stand anymore
7093661 i was going to be a focus of the rally
7093662 pastor manning had just joined bethelite community church he was fresh out of prison
7093663 as a younger man pastor manning burglarized homes mostly on long island he spent about three and a half years in prison in new york and florida for burglary robbery larceny criminal possession of a weapon and other charges before his release in 1978 while in prison he became a devout christian

7093665 why would they call it building 7 if it were the 3rd building to fall
7093666 you know how to get to work already but cant always navigate around traffic
7093667 there are broadcast channels where you can listen to the traffic audibly with this you can listen to music and see the traffic info pop up this will show red yellow or green lines to show the flow of traffic as it happens
7093668 that gives an indication that its not just cadillac and lexus that offers this
7093669 its integrated into the car you can use it in a seemless way
7093670 nissan does it very well so does cadillac ford does it with sync which adds a level of voice control scion has it in at least two of its cars
7093671 its no trick to get that in an expensive car but in a ford focus scion or moderately priced nissan it is
7093672 nissan ford and scion have made a point at looking at what customers really want they want high tech gadgety things
7093673 chrysler has done a nice job of offering the ability to play videos or play music from separate sources
7093674 if a kid is watching a dvd you can listen to your own music then older kids in way back can play a video game
7093675 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc
7093676 an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
7093677 there are many possible methods to determine age but they are not very accurate the error is about two years
7093678 we all age at different rates at the molecular level
7093679 aufgrund der situation die sich durch das gegentor und den platzverweis ergeben hat war es nicht einfach f r uns daher ist es wirklich bemerkenswert wie meine mannschaft in der zweiten halbzeit gespielt hat wie sie den ausgleich erzwingen wollte
7093680 wir haben in der anfangsphase sehr gut gespielt nach dem platzverweis aber nachgelassen
7093681 das ist rgerlich nach einem spiel mit dem ich durchaus zufrieden war wir haben uns selbst um den lohn unserer arbeit gebracht
7093682 das ergebnis geht in ordnung wir haben erneut gezeigt dass wir nicht so leicht zu bezwingen sind
7093683 leverkusen war wesentlich zweikampfst rker wir waren nicht pr sent aggressiv genug au erdem haben wir unsere torchancen nicht gemacht der sieg von leverkusen geht v llig in ordnung
7093684 wir haben in der ersten h lfte nicht so gut gespielt wie wir das eigentlich k nnen deshalb war die f hrung zur halbzeit auch etwas schmeichelhaft nach der pause haben wir dann richtig stark gespielt und am ende hochverdient gewonnen
7093685 life is what happens while you are busy making other plans
7093686 i dont understand how or why people behave the way they do
7093687 lord i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof but only say the word and my soul shall be healed
7093688 and the scribes and pharisees began to think saying who is this who speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone
7093689 i saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed
7093690 and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
7093691 the lords words to the apostle peter in matthew 16 19 as to binding and to all the disciples in 18 18 signify in the former case that the apostle by his ministry of the word of life would keep unbelievers outside the kingdom of god and admit those who believed
7093692 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved
7093693 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3 000 souls
7093694 to him christ give all the prophets witness that through his christs name whosoever believeth in him christ shall receive remission of sins
7093695 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
7093696 depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels
7093697 god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar
7093698 come now and let us reason together and has said in so many words herself that her eyes and ears are closed she is not ready and so we can only pray for her at this point and i have done so
7093699 there has been a historical process of expropriation of the means of production on the part of the clergy to the detriment of the christian people
7093700 the sacred power must be put back in the hands of the people
7093701 on may 13 1981 within three weeks of that private papal conference to fire arrupe john paul ii was struck by two bullets from the browning semiautomatic pistol of paid hitman mehmet ali agca by mistake as it was later explained the pontiff was rushed to the roman hospital of gemelli rather than to the special hospital unit organized solely for papal use he was given blood from the public blood bank the private supply kept in readiness was never used in rapid succession pope john paul underwent two major operations and suffered the consequences of the transfusion of impure blood he contracted a severe case of hepatitis at the height of the pontiffs crisis on may 28 cardinal wyszynski of warsaw died wyszynski was john pauls closest friend and had made his career
7093702 in some respects the meeting that convened in the middle of spring 1981 bore the marks of thousands of board meetings going on at the same moment in every daylight country of the world beyond glass paneled double doors a conference between seven men was in progress a folder bulging with reports lay in front of each man at each mans elbow a full carafe of water topped with a glass was perched anyone happening to glance in might have said that the men gathered there were absorbed in the sort of hushed but free wheeling discussion typical of board meetings everywhere but this was not the sort of meeting most people have ever witnessed or even glimpsed through shut glass paneled doors this conference room was on the third floor of the palace of the popes on vatican hill the report folders were red damask and emblazoned in gold with the tiara and keys outside the door a secretary and two swiss guards in traditional uniform were on duty to block all intruders seated at the conference table were the pontiff of the holy roman catholic church and six of his most powerful cardinals the movers and shakers of the vatican a cameo of its most formidable strength and the subject of discussion between them was the life or death of the society of jesus whether in other words the order headed by father general pedro arrupe should be allowed to go on as it was or be reorganized and reset according to the often repeated wishes of three popes or be officially done to death by the power and under the authority of pope john paul ii
7093703 a summary of this material was made generally available through the associated press which published the following short note on march 31
7093704 soon after the conclave the new pope had a talk with the 20 cardinals from latin america and was deeply impressed by the fact that most of them supported liberation theology
7093705 on the basis of paul vis critical dossier and with the help of a very experienced old jesuit father paolo dezza who had been confessor to pope paul vi and now was john paul is confessor the pope composed a hard hitting speech of warning
7093706 let it not happen that the teachings and publications of jesuits contain anything to cause confusion among the faithful
7093707 paul meanwhile was in desperate need of help of all sorts his health had been deteriorating in an operation that took place on the fourth floor of the apostolic palace in november of 1967 the pontiffs prostate gland was removed contrary to rumors there had been no metastasis more miseries of the mortal kind came from the extremely arthritic condition of pauls legs and from his cervical arthritis that last condition forced him to wear a stiff collar beneath his robes in order to lessen the pain a circumstance that saved his life during his visit to manila the kris wielded by the bolivian painter and would be papal assassin benjamin amor y mendoza was sharp enough to have severed pauls jugular veins as mendoza slashed twice once to the right and once to the left side of pauls neck had it not been for that stiff collar and the speed of pauls private secretary monsignore macchi who caught mendozas arm and slowed its force paul would have been killed as it was he was wounded slightly on both sides of the neck
7093708 again in 1590 the same pope sixtus v decided to change the name
7093709 you have to doff your hat or bow your head
7093710 if god causes you to suffer much it is a sign that he has great designs for you and that he certainly intends to make you a saint and if you wish to become a great saint entreat him yourself to give you much opportunity for suffering for there is no wood better to kindle the fire of holy love than the wood of the cross which christ used for his own great sacrifice of boundless charity
7093711 few souls understand what god would accomplish in them if they were to abandon themselves unreservedly to him and if they were to allow his grace to mold them accordingly
7093712 you think that everybody is edified with those copies of yours i dont show many of them nor do i read many of them i havent the time two letters could be made out of the 3 superfluous matter in your principal letter
7093713 look for god in all men and serve them as images of him
7093714 barack obama ha escogido a joe biden como su compa ero de f rmula
7093715 joe biden aporta su extensa experiencia en pol tica exterior asombrosos antecedentes de colaboraci n entre los partidos y un enfoque directo a cumplir con el trabajo
7093716 no ha habido un cr tico m s duro de la falta de experiencia de barack obama que joe biden
7093717 biden ha criticado el mal juicio de barack obama en pol tica exterior y ha afirmado duramente en sus propias palabras que los estadounidenses se est n dando cuenta r pidamente de que barack obama no est listo para ser presidente
7093718 to us the main objective is to bring peace and stability in this area
7093719 no they leave us alone and we leave them alone
7093720 no they might encourage people to observe islamic law but most of us do so anyway
7093721 if anybody says anything bad about the taliban theyll go after them
7093722 why is the government bombing our homes the taliban want to bring peace to the area
7093723 it is because of these atrocities that people are giving the militants more and more sympathy
7093724 but then it made a turn as if the wing dropped abruptly
7093725 we were still very low very close to the ground
7093726 and then the wind shifted and i felt how the smoke was burning me
7093727 he may not be a threat to the u s but he is to the people hes allegedly been attacking
7093728 has not been in great health hes being treated for a number of medical issues that one would expect in an elderly male who hasnt exactly had a tranquil life
7093729 i worry that these cases have the tendency to make very bad law
7093730 willing to tolerate terrorists as long as they are your friends
7093731 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7093732 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7093733 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
7093734 life is what happens while you are busy making other plans
7093735 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7093736 i slept through the whole thing it wasnt very dramatic when it came onshore
7093737 i just think were so fortunate we didnt have high tide and a stronger wind because hurricane dennis is still fresh in our mind the tidal surge we had in here
7093738 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7093739 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7093740 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7093741 i offered to pay for that one sign if they would agree to use gender neutral ones
7093742 the head of the work crew said he had gender neutral signs but refused to use them no charges were filed
7093743 signs such as men at work unintentionally reinforce the idea that only men are suited for and are capable of doing outdoor physical jobs
7093744 the response is weve seen none of those signs theyre not out there
7093745 my guess is that atlanta probably bought a bunch of signs back in the late 70s early 80s and maybe werent aware of the change
7093746 not in compliance with the ceasefire and that they need to come into compliance now

7093753 tiny south island finance company st kilda has thrown in the towel and stopped taking new investments from the public
7093754 it has been a very difficult year for the company for obvious reasons
7093755 at the time of preparing this report 24 finance companies have failed in one way or another and the financial markets worldwide are extremely volatile as each finance company failure was reported the flow of investor funds reduced until there were virtually no new investments coming to hand at the same time the re investment level reduced from 65 to 15 resulting in a continuing outflow of funds
7093756 the last primary season is a direct result of 1968
7093757 had there been party leaders who had a major role in choosing the nominee this year it is probably much more likely it would have been a hillary clinton rather than a young barack obama
7093758 i think people figured if these guys cant run a convention without battling each other in the street and on the floor of the convention hall how the hell can they run the country
7093759 as representatives and senators saw the way students were taking to the streets they thought wed be better off if we channeled this into regular participation and not street politics
7093760 it became one of those images that has lasted and stuck with us

7093764 winston peters allegations in the house at question time on july 31 were well known sir robert jones for several years provided a rent free office to act and it probably was worth as peters claimed about 20 000 a year what peters didnt know was when act moved out and sir robert had to spend a couple of thousand dollars making it rentable again he was told by an act board member to send the bill to parliamentary services so the taxpayers could pay act did have a separate asian chapter into whose coffers many thousands of dollars were poured i remember going to a fundraising dinner at a chinese restaurant in pakuranga and an asian property developer from remuera paid about 20 000 for a signed photograph of richard prebble most of the throng attending this dinner paid to sign up to the asian chapter then when act took donna awatere huata to the supreme court to have her expelled from parliament the asian chapter was pressured to pay the legal bills because their candidate kenneth wang was next on the list
7093765 helen is paying the price of a mistake in not being nice enough to the green party the greens have gone a bit weak at the knees on the watered down scheme indicating they may not support it and they are asking the public to email them on how to vote i suspect it is largely a stunt to gain them more publicity because they are languishing in the polls and urgently need to galvanise some voter support this suspicion was reinforced when jeanette fitzsimons was asked if her caucus was split on how the party should vote she replied she would not know until next tuesdays caucus because she had not spoken to her mps good grief there are only half a dozen of them and the carbon footprint from six phone calls to find out what they thought would not be too great surely fitzsimons and her cunning co leader russel norman are trying to drag out the issue with this bit of theatre to gain maximum media coverage in the run up to the election

7093821 the strong public interest here in access to the information about a case involving millions of taxpayer dollars outweighs the desire of the committee and or debtor to evade public scrutiny
7093822 the unsecured creditors committee filed its motion earlier this month to restrict access to some information particularly as it relates to del biaggios interests in the predators hockey club
7093823 the value of this interest depends in part upon relations with the national hockey league and with the other owners of the team both of which stand to be injured upon disclosure of confidential and privileged information

7093845 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
7093846 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
7093847 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
7093848 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing

7093855 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7093856 the selection of senator biden is smart and strategic he is extremely capable on matters of foreign policy and international affairs and his ability to frame the complex issues facing america in simple terms is a gift as importantly he will be helpful to the campaigns effort to win the adjacent states of pennsylvania and new jersey i was privileged to work with him in his first presidential campaign and am confident that senator obamas decision to choose him as his running mate will produce the kind of change our nation so desperately needs
7093857 today is a great day for democrats we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president this campaign is going to make history not only will we put barack obama and his running mate joe biden into the white house but were going to elect a filibuster proof senate majority that can and will pass the democratic agenda this is the once in a generation chance weve been waiting for our party has never been more energized or more dedicated across the country we have set records for voter registration and primary participation in just a matter of hours well gather in denver for a democratic convention that will demonstrate our amazing and growing strength for the final stretch before election day barack obama and joe biden are on a path to bring sweeping change to this great country each and every committed democrat stands proudly with them today and right on through election day together we will take back the white house and elect the filibuster proof senate majority we need to bring that change

7093910 we used that to build on and go out and work harder so it doesnt happen again
7093911 how about concentrating on the intermediate hurdles where we went 1 2 3 or the 400 where we went 1 2 3 i am not proud that we were not in the 4x100 finals ive lived my life to be in that race we werent there but i cant change it but it shouldnt be a reflection on how this mens team performed they performed well and im extremely pleased at the end of the day
7093912 he just said go out there you have a job to do so go out there and kick butt and thats what we did

7093914 i probably slept for 30 minutes i couldnt stop thinking about it i stayed with my family i thought it was the best place to be and we started talking about different things and get me to forget about the race but its hard to work four years and then come up short i dont think that memory will go away overnight i think about it a lot but at least now i have something positive to think about as well
7093915 i went out there with the mindset that i was going to hang with the guys that i was going to follow them
7093916 i followed them but at some point they kicked a little bit and i could not go with them and i got slower and slower and slower and slower my chest was burning like crazy and it felt so dry everywhere
7093917 i was asked if i used this to redeem myself from the opening and thats not it at all this is a team relay not individuals we came together as a team and all went out there and ran our hardest and came out with an olympic record were proud of that and have a lot more to come in the future

7093956 well its understandable protective isnt the right word kay mommy pero siyempre kahit paano nandun ang maternal instinct naman pero of course sooner or later when time passes by siyempre gusto rin naman niya na magkaapo at ako magkaroon ng sarili kong pamilya pero siguro not now which is perfectly understandable
7093957 i think its maternal instinct its not necessarily strict dahil she was never strict sa akin kahit bata pa ako gumigimik na ako first year high school pa lang gumigimik na ako because she knew she trusted me naman alam niyang responsible din ako so she was never strict to me never akong nagka curfew umuuwi ako after two weeks okey lang sa kanya galing ang galing magpalaki
7093958 siguro ngayon ang dami ko pang kailangang gawin ang dami pang puwedeng pagkakitaan marami pang priorities na kailangan na i focus muna pero sa akin walang definite age if alam mo marami ka pang kailangang gawin then go for it
7093959 no definitely kahit mag asawa na ako i would love to have my mom right by my side so it wont be difficult na my mom checked up on me thats a good thing dahil you always know that you are loved
7093960 yun yung para sa akin pinaka ano doon necessity hindi naman kailangang pag usapan walang buhay na nakataya sabi nga ni angel sa interview namin sa entertainment live yung sa amin its on a personal basis na we dont need to expound on it naman
7093961 dahil sabi nga namin its not that we want to keep it really private yung parang we dont need to talk about it pero angel and i lumalabas kami in public nagmu mall kami so parang its not worth hiding e parang we just dont need to
7093962 yun nga may buhay bang nakataya pag sumagot ako o hindi meron bang nakaabang sa building wala naman na pag oo may tatalon kapag hindi di ba theres no necessity naman kumbaga sinasabi namin ni angel palagi kahit paano ibalato na lang sa amin
7093963 hindi kasi one sa amin ni anne when we started coming out about our status before seven years ago hindi pa ako showbiz noon so thats why we were open to talk about it
7093964 nancy especially mas lalo akong hindi showbiz noon at siya rin hindi pa siya showbiz noon commercial model pa lang siya
7093965 hindi kaya nga yung sa amin for example if pj palayaw ni piolo and angel are seen somewhere for example sa belo party i cant because im with calayan
7093966 and i understand naman na magkaibigan sila pj and angel theres nothing wrong kung pumunta sila together and sabi nga nila sila ang love team kami hindi wala kaming ipinu promote
7093967 im so happy kahit very open ako sa gma 7 sa pagsasabing i can work on bigger challenges
7093968 wala akong karapatang magreklamo dahil tuloy tuloy ang ibinibigay nilang trabaho sa akin sa ngayon tatlong regular exposures ang nae enoy ko sa gma 7 at pinagtatrabahuan ko rin naman nang husto
7093969 sapat na yung paniniwala ng gma 7 na if theres a good role and character naiisip nila ako na they can really depend on me for such challenges only for that i should always be thankful
7093970 aside from that im working in my farm sa sta maria bulacan
7093971 nagpapatanim ako ng mga gulay different crops agricultural food production ang business ko at ito ang tinututukan ko
7093972 may iba pa akong negosyo sa ngayon bumabalik na lang ang kita sa akin pero dito sa farming at food production ako naglalaan ng maraming oras four times a week pinupuntahan ko ang farm even if i have taping lets say papuntang subic hindi puwedeng hindi ko aagahan ang alis para mga fifteen minutes man lang makapag stay ako sa farm
7093973 parang mas nag e enjoy ako sa farm ngayon tahimik hindi ako pressured at nakakapag relax ako kahit paano
7093974 ito na yung time na nare realize ng televiewers ang substance ng role ko na hindi lang ako palamuti na ako ang symbol ng selfless love kay dyesebel yung mga taong nami meet ko tinatawag na akong erebus which is my character in the series nagpapasalamat ako at naibigay sa akin ang ganitong klaseng role na kakaiba because i play the role of a merman na nagkatawang tao na rin
7093975 hindi rin siguro maiiwasan dahil magkatrabaho kami pero ang maganda kasi nagkahiwalay kami ni lj na magkaibigan kaya kumportable pa rin kami sa isat isa sa ngayon we really have to be professional never na nagkaproblema sa amin ni lj basta trabaho lang
7093976 sa dami ng dapat kong asikasuhin ayoko na talagang maulit uli yung makikipagrelasyon ako na hindi ko maibibigay ang mas maraming oras gaya sa naging kakulangan ko kay lj
7093977 kung magkakarelasyon ako uli sisiguraduhin ko namang maayos ang lahat ayoko na ng ganoong conflict lalo na kung nagiging unfair ako sa babae pagdating sa oras at atensiyon
7093978 one can tell a gentleman by the way he treats those for whom he has no use
7093979 what have i done if i would have taken the 360 000 i could have paid off all my bills and not have to work at all
7093980 hey look theres the my gym we used to go to
7093981 sinabihan na ako ng gma 7 na may follow up na ang exposure ko sa joaquin bordado natutuwa sila sa resulta ng telserye at itong susunod na lalabasan ko it will be something different hindi pa puwedeng magsabi ng detalye hanggat wala pang go signal
7093982 marami ngang magagandang nangyayari sa career ko isa na ang project na pagsasamahan namin nina dingdong dantes at marian rivera its going to be a movie na ididirek ni mac alejandre for gma films
7093983 naku hindi naman siguro pero alam kong hindi ako madedehado i must be aware that their team up is so popular pero alam kong hindi naman ako basta lalabas lang na kontrabida sa kanila hindi rin ako basta binibigyan sa ngayon ng contravida role eventually perhaps pero kahit kontrabida wala akong mairereklamo basta may impact at hindi yung magiging kawawa lang ako
7093984 thats not true on that day lang kasi kailangang mag work ako nag taping ako ng
7093985 okey lang sa akin yun hindi naman ako naghahangad na parang isasali pa ako sa birthday concert nina marian at dingdong sa araneta coliseum ano naman ang gagawin ko doon marian and dingdong deserve that and lets give that to them since they are the hottest love team now
7093986 sinabi ba talaga ni mark na fan niya lang ako yun ang sabi niya sige fan lang po ako pero may fan po ba na sinasakay sa van niya pinapatulog sa bahay nila pag gabi pagkatapos ng taping gusto niya pumunta ako ng taping hindi ako pumapasok sa school kasi gusto niya doon lang ako tapos ngayon fan niya lang ako
7093987 as in noong nagsisimula pa ako sa starstruck tapos siya talaga fan ko na pag tapings nandoon na talaga gusto ko lang i clear na yung lumabas na issue last week e hindi po siya yon kasi unang una po yung balita naglabas ng pictures di ba kung ako maninira lang or kung maglalabas ng ganoon e bakit ako mahihiya na ipakita sarili ko o bakit ako hindi magpapa interview at text lang dahil ayoko lumabas sa tv so hindi si val ito
7093988 yung mga fan na galit doon sa love team ng mark and rhian ramos e sila ang mga nang aaway so may nag text sa akin two days before sc and sabi abangan mo showbiz central magpapasabog kami ng issue about diyan kay val so nangdadamay sila ng tao yun po ang totoo
7093989 hindi naman ako ma ano na tao e pala kaibigan ako kaya yun
7093990 masasabi mo ba na fault mo din na masyado kang malapit sa mga tagahanga at sa ibang tao
7093991 ako naman kasi may mali ako pero kilala ko din kasi yung mga fan ko na tunay na ugali nila e
7093992 hindi lang basta tagahanga kialala ko din tunay na pagkatao nila so may mali din ako na sobrang close
7093993 ano ang masasabi mo kay valerie sa naglalabasang issue na ito
7093994 kung si valerie ka talaga kung ikaw talaga yan humarap ka sa camera o sa media punta ka sa startalk at magpa interview ka hindi ako natatakot
7093995 bakit sabi sa akin ni anna pingol ng yes magazine na pumayag ka daw magparetrato kasama ang baby ni jennylyn
7093996 papayag ako pag kaming mga ninong kasama pero yung solo ayoko
7093997 kasi hindi pa ako nakakapunta kay jen o natatawagan kasi nga siguro kailangan pa magpahinga nung tao si tita lydia lang ang kausap ko at ka text
7093998 hindi ka ba natatakot na malagyan ng kulay ang patuloy na pagsuporta kay jennlyn
7093999 hindi naman siguro kasi wala naman ibig sabihin ang pagtulong ko tumutulong lang ako

7094084 its pretty simple you as a lecturer can take classes of any quality as you like that is if kids attend firstly and get away with it not something you can really do in our case and so on as easily for you what you have learnt in college is the end here you just have to keep unlearning and relearning
7094085 whatever happens no one employed now will lose jobs for next 20 years
7094086 have turned our government into a game only they can afford to play
7094087 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice
7094088 true religion will not let us fall asleep in the comfort of our freedom love thy neighbor is not a piece of advice its a command god my friends is with the poor and god is with us if we are with them this is not a burden this is an adventure
7094089 contemporary jihad is not a matter of politics at all of occupation of grievances of colonialism neocolonialism imperialism and zionism but a matter of gnostic faith consequently attempts at dealing with the problem politically will not even touch it
7094090 those who do not accept baptism are to be killed then they will be baptized in their blood
7094091 accursed be the man who withholds his sword from shedding the blood of the enemies of christ every believer must wash his hands in that blood every priest may lawfully pursue wound and kill sinners
7094092 the just will not rejoice seeing vengeance and washing their hands with the blood of sinners
7094093 curse the unbelievers dont let them live any longer the evil doers who turn away from god for a godless man has no right to live if he hinders the godly the sword is necessary to exterminate them if they resist let them be slaughtered without mercy the ungodly have no right to live save what the elect choose to allow them now go at them it is time the scoundrels are as dispirited as dogs take no notice of the lamentations of the godless they will beg you dont be moved by pity at them at them while the fire is hot dont let your sword get cold dont let it go lame
7094094 if hitler invaded hell i would make at least a favorable reference to the devil in the house of commons
7094095 deterrence works because one is able credibly to threaten the center of gravity of the enemy the threat of inflicting unacceptable losses upon him whether in a bar brawl or in nuclear escalation deterrence works if the price to be paid by the party to be deterred hugely exceeds his expected earnings but deterrence only works if the enemy is able and willing to enter the same calculus if the enemy plays by other rules and calculates by other means he will not be deterred if the calculus is i exchange my worthless earthly life against the triumph of allah on earth and an eternity of bliss for me if the enemy wishes to be dead if to him the apocalypse is desirable he will not be deterred
7094096 the difference between the religious and the ideologically religious is this the religious believer accepts that reality is a given whereas the fanatic gambles everything on a pseudo reality of what ought to be the religious believer accepts reality and works at improving it the fanatic rejects reality refuses to pass any compromise with it and tries to destroy it and replace it with his fantasy
7094097 contemporary jihad is not a matter of politics at all of occupation of grievances of colonialism neocolonialism imperialism and zionism but a matter of gnostic faith
7094098 soldiers kill terrorists kill modern jihadis lap the blood inseparable from contemporary arab muslim jihad are the idealization of blood the veneration of savagery the cult of killing the worship of death gruesome murder gory and gleeful infliction of pain are lionized and proffered as models and exemplary actions pleasing to allah these are no merely reflections of a pre modern attitude toward death
7094099 five shots fired at point blank range hit him he staggered and he fell dying among the shards of glass on the marble floor as he lay dying one of his killers bent over and lapped the blood that poured from his wounds
7094100 dr hammed boukhobza who was killed by a group of islamist terrorists in the city of telemly he was not just killed in his apartment but his wife and children who wanted to escape were forced to watch how he was literally cut to pieces his entrails slowly drawn out while he was just barely alive the terrorists obviously liked to watch the suffering and they wanted to family to share their enjoyment
7094101 this pornography of crime is endless from the gratuitous killing of a leon klinghoffer to mohammad attas instructions
7094102 as i said a soldier kills a jihadi loves to kill
7094103 how do we deter the modern gnostic warriors the jihadi
7094104 mainly we do not those who are dead already who consider themselves dead to the world and only alive to the afterworld those who wish to die generally cannot be deterred faith has been described as a belief in things invisible gnosticism is belief in a fantasy that is taken to be more real than the common reality they do not believe what they see they see what they believe this cannot be deterred
7094105 if our enemy was merely terrorism we could defang it admittedly at great cost by destroying the saudi wahhabi nexus and their grip on power by wiping out the iranian ayatollahs strength and by squeezing hard the noxious pakistani military intelligence establishment all in all the linchpins of muslim terrorism once this infrastructure of terror collapsed much of terror would but terror itself is nothing but the principal paramilitary instrument of jihad the operative concept is jihad not terror some workarounds work the way in which israeli military and security forces have ruthlessly sapped the strength of islamic terror notably by a high tempo attrition of its leadership cadre is exemplary and should be studied and emulated elsewhere
7094106 contemporary jihad like its emanation terrorism is an integral chain as long as it is islamico glamorous to be a cleric who issues fatwas calling for the murder of israeli civilians or american gis the cleric will go on once dead he will stop so will the chairman of a charity that funnels money to jihad so will the senior intelligence officer who trains or smuggles them the predicator who incites the madrasa or university professor who brainwashes the prince who lies for terror the ayatollah who sends out teams of killers etc
7094107 jihad is the operative ideology of a number of states states can be pinned down and hit this approach is a variant of the notion of decapitation or of the formulation of nodal targeting given by air power theorist col john warden less than the jihadi hardware it is the jihadi software that has to be hit but not by soft power
7094108 one martyr will have followers ten martyrs will be admired and emulated
7094109 you cannot make a martyr out of him since this is what he wants
7094110 jihad is integral to islam and derives from its most fundamental tenets
7094111 applying high tempo attrition and nodal targeting to the jihadi apparatus worldwide by which i emphatically do not mean terrorists alone or even in the first place seems to me to be a modern equivalent it is those who deploy the undead who must be the priority targets

7094206 i dont know much about biden but ive heard he has move international experience
7094207 its probably a wise choice because thats one of the areas where obama is perceived as weakest
7094208 hes also argumentative which is a good thing for someone in the second position it takes some pressure off the presidential candidate

7094210 now that hes part of the ticket that will change
7094211 they are both intellectual and will be able to put together sentences that neither mccain nor whoever he picks as a running mate could never put together
7094212 i love biden he was my second choice for the democratic nominee
7094213 he has good international experience and a long record he puts a lot of weight into the campaign
7094214 he has been an outstanding senator and would have been a good presidential candidate
7094215 i think a woman not necessarily hillary would have been a better choice
7094216 i dont know that much about bidens record and i think thats important when making a choice because obama has said he would rely heavily on the people around him as president
7094217 i dont know yet whether he was a good choice for obama
7094218 until we hear more its hard to say whether he will help or hurt obama
7094219 theres no evidence it has happened and no evidence it will happen
7094220 in selecting sen joe biden as his running mate sen obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of
7094221 sen bidens record in the united states senate is one of support and understanding that has been unwavering throughout his career
7094222 we only need to look back to the recent passage of the repeal of the hiv travel and immigration ban to see the type of leadership we can expect from sen biden on the issues important to our community
7094223 it was because of his determination and tenacity that we were able to see this relic of discrimination against people living with hiv aids torn down
7094224 if the support sen biden has proven on our issues is any indication of the type of vice president he will be than our community can be assured that sen obama has chosen a thoughtful and staunch advocate for equality as his closest adviser

7094325 i think obama can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training

7094327 my idea was to show dramatically the toll that the war was taking
7094328 i was kind of surprised they were being passed or even being considered

7094335 fraziers t shirts are themselves core political speech fully protected by the first amendment his website is like a street side table used to disseminate anti war and political messages

7094351 sparked a nationwide controversy over whether catholics who support legal abortion can receive communion
7094352 selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7094353 the american bishops have instructed catholic voters to consider many issues but have characterized the defense of human life as foundational and have explained that the issue has a special claim on the conscience of the catholic voter this means that a political candidate like biden because of his strong support for abortion rights forfeits any claim for support despite his views on other issues like health care and the economy

7094364 ive spoken to andriy 48 times in the past three hours the terms of the agreement are very private
7094365 between today and tomorrow andriy will be at milan and he will start again his life as a milan player
7094366 andriy made a mistake in leaving and i believe that in the past two years he has realised that this is his home
7094367 now he has made his financial sacrifices but at this point the only thing that matters is that he returns to us
7094368 its been a blessing for me to be out on this court
7094369 i havent necessarily played great during this tournament tonight i got into some foul trouble as did diana taurasi and katie smith but we fought hard and beat australia its the third olympics in a row weve faced them for the gold for all those kids out there i encourage you to write down all your goals
7094370 you look at the shooting and that tells a story
7094371 we were down in the 20s percent you cant win ball games like that so credit goes to them

7094374 i never expected to beat blanka because for almost one year shes been unbeatable
7094375 but its always nice to be at your best at big championships
7094376 we gave a recommendation this does not mean it will be a final decision
7094377 the wtf will look into it as to what legal actions can be taken
7094378 it is a most unfortunate situation it is an insult to olympism and insult to the spirit of taekwondo and an insult to mankind
7094379 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7094380 this is outstanding when we came here we didnt think about the gold medal
7094381 our goal was third place but every game we gave 200 percent
7094382 we fought hard and i think that its a good medal
7094383 our bats woke up brett pitched a great ball game
7094384 weve been working very hard for the last four years
7094385 we are a very bonded team each and every player of the team deserved this gold

7094391 being named the us flag bearer for the closing ceremony is almost like winning a gold medal maybe even better
7094392 i thought i could win a gold medal in competition but i never thought id have this opportunity i am truly truly so proud to be an american citizen and part of the u s olympic team
7094393 i think its great to get the silver and i won it in a fair way
7094394 but its not my place to judge her blonska i just wanted to get on the medal stand i didnt know where it would be im very happy with the silver

7094410 and look tim if you tell me ive got to take away this protection for these kids in order to win the election some things arent worth it some things are worth losing over that would be worth losing over hundreds of lives are being saved and will be saved by us sending these vehicles over which we are funding with this supplemental legislation and i want to ask any of my other colleagues would they in fact vote to cut off the money for those troops to protect them thats the right question this isnt cutting off the war this is cutting off support that will save the lives of thousands of american troops

7094471 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole

7094567 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
7094568 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security we have no choice but to eliminate the threat this is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world he must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power

7094601 sparked a nationwide controversy over whether catholics who support legal abortion can receive communion
7094602 selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7094603 the american bishops have instructed catholic voters to consider many issues but have characterized the defense of human life as foundational and have explained that the issue has a special claim on the conscience of the catholic voter this means that a political candidate like biden because of his strong support for abortion rights forfeits any claim for support despite his views on other issues like health care and the economy

7094615 one of obamas strongest distinctions from mccain was his wisdom and courage in opposing the invasion of iraq
7094616 this isnt american democracy in action its the failure of american democracy before we go to war with iraq we must be able to determine that iraq poses a threat to the national security of the united states such a determination must be backed up with substantive fact i believe that iraq does not pose a threat to the u s worthy of war this conclusion is shared by many senior military officers according to president bush and his advisers iraq is known to possess weapons of mass destruction and is actively seeking to reconstitute the weapons production capabilities i bear personal witness through seven years as a chief weapons inspector in iraq for the un to both the scope of iraqs weapons of mass destruction programs and the effectiveness of the un weapons inspectors in ultimately eliminating them while we were never able to provide 100 percent certainty regarding the disposition of iraqs proscribed weaponry we did ascertain a 90 95 percent level of verified disarmament these are the sort of facts that must be included in any hearing that seeks to determine the threat posed by iraq today it is clear that sen biden and his colleagues have no interest in such facts
7094617 i do not believe this is a rush to war i believe it is a march to peace and security i believe that failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur saddam hussein possesses chemical and biological weapons and is seeking nuclear weapons
7094618 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
7094619 the only way the only way were going to get rid of saddam hussein is were going to end up having to start it alone start it alone and its going to require guys like you ritter in uniform to be back on foot in the desert taking this son of a the taking saddam down
7094620 the revolution may not be televised but it will be up loaded
7094621 the good news about this team is theyve been through an experience that will allow them to continue to develop to understand the work that needs to take place
7094622 we really invest in what weve determined to be our process that process helps us identify the team
7094623 i see our players getting along i see great chemistry
7094624 i like the idea that the running backs are veteran the tight end is veteran the fullback and the receivers are veteran i think its a great position for a newcomer at quarterback to get comfortable and understand that the guys that are around him are all capable
7094625 i know there are a number of lsu olympians that are off representing our country
7094626 several times quietly i have said to trindon we wish that you were there but were glad that you are still here
7094627 were not defending were not dealing with rankings this is a brand new year if were defending come see the trophy its in our trophy case were not defending it its there
7094628 catchers arent there just for their offense defense and their ability to handle a pitching staff and call a game are arguably more important

7094637 we are very happy that you have passed our little test we couldnt ask for a better man for our daughter welcome to the family
7094638 i believe that we have got to start engaging in diplomacy and that is what i would do beginning now if i were president
7094639 and if our president does not end our involvement in iraq when i am president i will
7094640 we have bad options and worse options the best option i believe is to make certain that we begin a phased redeployment that we are as careful getting out as we were careless getting in
7094641 if i were president today i would withdraw all our forces before the end of this calendar year
7094642 but where i differentiate with the other candidates is i leave no residual forces
7094643 i would get sunni and the shia leadership engaged in serious discussions to see if they can reach some kind of political solution political reconciliation
7094644 because without that there is never going to be peace in iraq
7094645 and we need a president who can defend our country but also who knows when war is wrong and is ready to say so when it counts not four years later not five years later
7094646 there is one person who i think has the greatest chance if you figure the odds of all 18 candidates both republicans and democrats there is one candidate if you had to pick one who has the best chance to be president i think it is hillary clinton the senator from new york
7094647 she is ahead and she has been ahead and she stays ahead without much change
7094648 there is no question that mrs clinton is very very popular among democrats but she still has a high number of negatives in the quinnipiac poll and in everybodys polls
7094649 i believe that we have got to start engaging in diplomacy and that is what i would do beginning now if i were president

7094696 jim did mention the terrible pollutants coming from the smoke stacks and the brown water he washed his clothes in while in theatre i read about depleted uranium and talked with him about it but he never said anything about being exposed to it and i dont think they tested him for it we asked the doctors if agent orange could be the cause and they said there was no way to tell we asked if he had been exposed to something in kuwait and again they couldnt say they did comment frequently on how aggressive his cancer was
7094697 when the doctor told him he had six months to live i dont think he believed it he still asked for more treatment
7094698 he tried to get stronger and the doctor said well you could try more chemo and die from a heart attack or you could die from the cancer
7094699 over 4th of july weekend skin lesions multiplied canvassing his neck back and chest
7094700 there were hundreds thousands of lesions circling the upper part of his entire body
7094701 his neck and throat was so swollen i pleaded with his doctors to make him more comfortable
7094702 it was the first time i had seen him laying still resting so i went back to the fisher house
7094703 the next morning i returned to the hospital at the usual time 5 00 am only to see his room door closed
7094704 i knew when i saw the door closed something had happened and the nurses asked if i had gotten a phone call and i did not they said he passed away at 4 55 am five minutes before i arrived
7094705 so i guess he was comfortable he slipped away in peace remaining in the same position i left him in the night before
7094706 jim said he knew where he was going and hed be okay but please pray for dixie
7094707 they the aforementioned dont talk to the sick soldiers nobody wanted to hear our story maybe when a wounded soldier dies but not a sick soldier the sick soldiers dont exist i firmly believe that just because they have gotten sick and were not injured they were still over there in iraq and served their country but its not the same in the militarys eyes or in the publics if you werent injured over there but you became sick instead it doesnt seem to count in the game of war

7094717 de belangrijkste conclusie van het onderzoek is dat latijn een minder goede voorbereiding is op het leren van een taal als spaans
7094718 de onderzoekers hadden een paar jaar geleden al vastgesteld dat bij duitse middelbare scholieren het leren van latijn ten opzichte van het leren van engels ook al niet leidt tot betere prestaties in wiskunde logisch rederen of tekstbegrip
7094719 maar wel de achtergrond in latijn of frans de fransen maakten bijna een derde minder grammaticale fouten en een kwart minder fouten in woordbetekenissen de latijnen faalden vooral omdat ze ten onrechte de logica van het latijn toepasten op het spaans

7094724 ron gardner contentdm specialist for oclc made the point that libraries are getting a lot more involved in the creation that goes on in libraries it got me thinking that we are still a little fixated on what comes into the library metadata creation organization even the library website rather than caring as much as we should about what goes out in a profession full of humanists and expert researchers is it time for us to be thinking even more about what people produce in libraries rather than simply finding them the right resources and leaving them to their best devices could the library profession be a key player in the quality of information that with or without our help is going to wind up available to millions through search and discovery mechanisms that are not of our own flawless ahem design were already playing a role in the production of mass digitization of our existing resources and the creation of digital portals for our unique resources isnt the next logical step to be the stewards of the things that are created from access to those things
7094725 many of us are in denial that we are in the age of digital natives how many times have we walked by people whom we thought were crazy only to find out that they have an earpiece attached to their cellphone watching someone using the wii controller to jog around second life is even odder only because weve never exercised that way second life is just another information place we can meet these people and serve them it doesnt have to be one world or another we can straddle as many worlds as we want and be all the more information richer we can even defeat a 12 year old at a video game its the same game different skin second life is the internet in a different form if we only set our minds to it we can free ourselves of our psychological barriers if i can do it you can do it too

7094752 im not complaining believe me because our offense is supposed to score points and that excites the fans
7094753 i just want people to know that our defense was really good under coach jon tenuta and now it has a chance to be even better with coach wommack
7094754 its a little bit easier to communicate with coach wommack
7094755 coach tenuta is a great defensive coordinator but is kind of a stern guy he tells you what he wants you to do so then its up to you to do what he says and produce
7094756 its kind of a question of well see when we play you really dont know because we havent got a lot of guys who have played a lot of football so its going to be interesting to see how everything works out we dont have any preconceived notions about guys
7094757 he has a pro style game with his length athleticism and ability to rush the passer
7094758 its not always about how many sacks you have its how you fit into a pro system
7094759 its not a question of whether hes got to make a name for himself
7094760 he already has what he needs to do is take advantage of his standing he needs to have a great year go play in the senior bowl and dominate people if he does that he has the physical capabilities to be a top 10 pick
7094761 but i try not to look at that kind of stuff i just go out and work hard every day and focus i kind of have an underdog mentality to go out and get better every day i never get content
7094762 when he was younger he wanted to be a marine
7094763 i said no i dont want you to be a marine i told him to go to a great institution and get an education instead with his great academic ability i really and truly thought he could make a contribution in a different area like maybe law medicine or something like that
7094764 this kid has worked to get himself in the position hes in
7094765 i talked to michael about his goals what he wanted to do where he wanted to be he stressed that he wanted to play in college and in the nfl we set goals for him and he reached every one of them by the time he graduated
7094766 heres a kid whos 6 7 and 260 pounds and probably runs a sub 4 6 40 yard dash
7094767 he can jump out of the gym change direction and hes got a great motor
7094768 hes a hard worker who plays with a great motor
7094769 hes fought some injury problems nothing major just some little stuff hes got to go out there and be an every down player hes got tremendous upside hes got great athletic ability physically hes a freak
7094770 in the nfl the two priorities are defensive ends or outside linebackers who can get to the quarterback and cover corners
7094771 theyre the kind of guys who dont make it to free agency too often they get re signed early or get franchised if theres a talented defensive end with the ability to get to the quarterback they dont last long
7094772 theres no such thing as a lock first round pick but hes going to have to have a great year which he should have
7094773 ive been playing ball since i was 10 years old expectations are from other people my expectations are always to do my best and to do well those are the expectations i have for myself i dont really worry about what other peoples expectations are most of the time im going to hold myself to a higher standard than anyone else
7094774 we had guys running wide open in the secondary we had missed assignments missed tackles theres a lot of stuff we need to work on
7094775 you hoped we were further along than we are it was a good message to me and the coaches weve got a lot of young guys who havent done it before
7094776 it felt more like a game the stuff coach threw at us could very well happen in a game we adjusted to it very well weve just got to get better
7094777 just think about the game and my job and try to get everybody ready
7094778 its getting me jacked up but i try to keep it off my mind and approach it like ive played every game since i started playing it when i was 8 years old
7094779 when you look at the statistics then i see a different game leverkusen were very strong in the tackle and we were just not aggressive enough and had to chase the ball a lot
7094780 if you dont use your goal scoring chances then you are going to lose the game leverkusen deserved their win
7094781 it is hard to say where it went wrong today
7094782 we had good chances ourselves but just couldnt convert them leverkusen played well and were a little sharper than us
7094783 last week we were more efficient with our chances but today our opponents were the first goal was particularly unlucky and could have been avoided
7094784 leverkusen are a young and talented side with good individual players they showed good movement today and deserved their win
7094785 it is hard to take but we didnt take our chances if i had made it 1 0 then the game perhaps would have gone quite differently
7094786 schade wir haben gut gespielt am ende bleibt die entt uschung ber nur einen punkt der ausgleich war ein geschenk
7094787 nat rlich war es ein technischer fehler von kaka aber ich bedauere meine entscheidung nicht kaka hat in der vorbereitung gut gespielt und jo hat noch etwas r ckstand
7094788 es gab sicher die eine oder andere szene wo wir gro es gl ck hatten
7094789 well not get carried away because weve only played two games
7094790 it was important we got something from the game we could have won it whether that would have been fair or not doesnt matter
7094791 but im ecstatic with a point it was a great point on our travels and if we can continue with that sort of passion and commitment then well be okay
7094792 but that bit of quality in the final third is what you pay big money for we had one or two half chances that we could have turned into real chances but we wasted those opportunities
7094793 viele von uns erhielten vor dem absturz von unseren verwandten sms aus dem flugzeug dass mit der maschine etwas nicht stimmte

7094796 good leadership permeates it cascades down not just to the players but to the secretaries and the hot dog vendors and yes even the elevator operators
7094797 a labile physical system is one that is in a state of flux
7094798 right now frank mccourt needs to be extremely astute with everything he does with a labile system any intervention any small movement could have a huge impact an impact that could be felt for years
7094799 mccourt sounds so damn equivocal whenever he is asked about collettis future that needs to stop

7094813 we sent him to germany and they did a wonderful job hes come back and hes a young keeper when there are guys like david james van der sar and brad friedel theres still a lot ahead of shay but he was brilliant today
7094814 it was always going to take something to get us going and to get the crowd going
7094815 for some reason we didnt pass it as well as we can we had one or two players just not seeing things as well as they normally do

7094880 increased activity of the bands is chiefly due to atrocities carried out by ustasha units in croatia against the orthodox population the ustashas committed their deeds in a bestial manner not only against males of conscript age but especially against helpless old people women and children the number of the orthodox that the croats have massacred and sadistically tortured to death is about three hundred thousand
7094881 all or nothing the axis and the holocaust 1941 1943
7094882 according to reliable reports from countless german military and civil observers during the last few weeks the ustasi have gone raging mad
7094883 our troops have to be mute witnesses of such events it does not reflect well on their otherwise high reputation i am frequently told that german occupation troops would finally have to intervene against ustasha crimes this may happen eventually right now with the available forces i could not ask for such action ad hoc intervention in individual cases could make the german army look responsible for countless crimes which it could not prevent in the past
7094884 we saw no sign of guerillas but there were plenty of ownerless horses and cattle not to mention innumerable geese at crkveni bok an unhappy place where under the leadership of ustase lieutenant colonel some 500 country folk from 15 to 20 years had met their end all murdered the women raped then tortured the children killed i saw in the river sava a womans corpse with the eyes gouged out and a stick shoved into the sexual parts the woman was at most 20 years old when she fell into the hands of these monsters anywhere in a corner the pigs are gorging themselves on an unburied human being all the houses were looted the lucky inhabitants were consigned to one of the fearsome boxcar trains many of these involuntary passengers cut their veins on the journey

7094892 the major political parties first gave credentials to bloggers in 2004 the republicans allowed a dozen bloggers to attend their convention in new york while the democrats gave bloggers 35 seats in the nosebleed section of the fleet center in boston this year the r n c gave credentials to 200 bloggers as a means to get senator mccains message out to more people said joanna burgos the press secretary of the convention for bloggers attending the democratic convention at the pepsi center in denver two types of credentials are offered the first is a national credential which offers the same access granted to members of traditional news media organizations the second more coveted credential is the state blogger credential it allows one blogger per state to cover the convention alongside its state delegation with unlimited floor access

7094895 it has often been said that the difficulty modern people have with faith is not so much about the arguments for or against it but with the difficulty of imagining gods presence in our highly secularised world
7094896 gambari said the government had allowed the meeting with daw aung san suu kyi even at her house but it was suu kyi who refused to see him
7094897 the enam committee report is not a rule it is just the report of a committee the bfa needs its own ordinance rules and policy to ensure quality preservation of films a policy is also needed to have modern equipments and facilities to preserve the present and the past in the most powerful form
7094898 an organisation preserving films which is like preserving artifacts and has to deal with creative people must have a policy or ordinance otherwise the institution would never become a centre for different cultures and it would not be able to perform its job of informing the next generation about their history
7094899 we have recently introduced a research fellowship programme started a project to modernise the film preservation process and we published our first ever journal the caretaker government has also decided to hand over the allotted 1 86 acre land for bfa in agargaon
7094900 before a film archive is established we must know the importance and benefits of the archive and criterions under which films are to be collected and preserved it should not happen this way once a government is changed the policy of an entire system gets changed and a certain genre of films is destroyed or removed in accordance with the likings of a government
7094901 what has become of the bfa today is just because of putting people who were never related to films in charge of the bfa none of the people appointed as bfa chief were ever involved in anything related to films and they did not even have the ability to understand films
7094902 i challenge you that you cannot name a single person appointed as chief of bfa as a film expert
7094903 it would be more appropriate if we consider the governments approach to film archive as the making of a concentration camp by transferring government officials to an institution which has been neglected and been under budgeted over the years this is indeed a punishment for the government officials
7094904 it is the smallest department under the information ministry and one might feel deprived once he or she is transferred to the bfa it is very normal
7094905 arrange collection of films from different sources for preservation in the film vaults
7094906 a lot of the films the bfa so far preserved are in video format and you might find a number of shops in dhaka selling videos or dvds from a better collection and with better preservation method this should not be the approach of a film archive
7094907 the government should have a criterion to collect films and encourage filmmakers to submit their films a filmmaker cannot give a print of his film just after release it should be purchased or the filmmaker can give it six months after the release of the film
7094908 the national institute of mass communication has been established mainly for electronic media the structure of the institution relates to radio and television and it does not have the structure to deal with films

7094915 we know that during the afternoon ahmed and a group of friends were on the top floor of the block of flats
7094916 they saw the group of six youths approach the estate on bikes at that point they decided to leave ahmed had become separated from his friends who went to the third floor
7094917 ahmed remained at the top and it seems that one or more of the group made their way up to ahmed and he has been so scared he has made his way out of the balcony to shin down the outside of the flat
7094918 when he got to the seventh floor his progress was stopped by a grille
7094919 he has cried out for help lost his grip and fallen to his death
7094920 ahmed was a very much loved son grandson brother and nephew his loss is an enormous tragedy for his loving and devoted family
7094921 he was a happy friendly and generous boy who stayed away from trouble and was a good student
7094922 on the day of his untimely death he was due to receive his gcse results he would have been delighted to discover that his hard work and dedication to his studies had rewarded him with passes in maths and science as well as other subjects
7094923 his 17th birthday would have been on september 1 and this was the day he was due to enrol on a mechanical engineering course at tower hamlets college

7094927 joe biden thinks its time to remind the world of what america stands for freedom equality justice opportunity he thinks its time to put courage over compromise time to express americas outrage once again towards repression brutality violence the abuse of human dignity around the world and if the sparks fly so be it
7094928 the lord almighty or allah whoever if he came to every kitchen table in america and said look i have a faustian bargain for you you choose i will guarantee to you that i will end all terror threats against the united states within the year but in return for that there will be no help for education no help for social security no help for health care what do you do my answer is that seventy five per cent of the american people would buy that bargain

7095132 uno de los objetivos de este gobierno era acabar la oficina del narcotr fico que se llama oficina de envigado
7095133 theyll take control of the state governments and start voting themselves anything they want
7095134 hes feeding an environment of intolerance that doesnt distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants
7095135 hes presenting our whole community as invaders people who want to take over the country
7095136 the farmers overall would be really concerned about his statement
7095137 hes not a regular farmer hes one of these big guys id call him a multinational farmer
7095138 there are a number of different achievements that this meeting will lead to
7095139 for example one is that we want to assist donors in gaining an understanding of climate change initiatives in the region and allow for better targeted assistance to areas in the action plan where there are gaps but above all the roundtable is intended to catalyse new and additional action to combat climate change in the region
7095140 to make a male feel himself to be less of a man by subjecting him to humiliation
7095141 it keeps going down so for our boats everything takes a lot longer
7095142 on the positive side more stuff is exposed for us to get so i guess it works both ways
7095143 its the roofs the trusses the 2x4s the electrical box and electrical wires and the structure itself
7095144 it gets caught up in a log jam so its all mangled
7095145 its kind of all held together by the internal wiring and board by board piece by piece piece of carpet or whatever it is we load up the boats one by one
7095146 we really need all the water we can get whether its rain or water from the upper reservoirs
7095147 we need rain but we dont need 14 inches in two days or something like that
7095148 its kind of weird to pick up pieces of peoples lives

7095151 when china can participate at olympics win gold medals and host olympic games
7095152 when we china spend creditable efforts to organize olympics they western media said were wasting money for the face when we mobilized million volunteers to support the games they accused therere punch of secret police and spies when we bring the best to show to the world they called it a propaganda when they running out of anything to say then they running the spin circle of critizing chinas environment records spots dope allegation safety concern human rights tibet cheating allegation etc
7095153 any international olympic visitors could tell you its not true

7095158 it helped to bring down murder and violent crime rates eight years in a row during the clinton administration
7095159 now president bush has cut the program substantially and crime rates are going back up it doesnt take a scientist to figure out why
7095160 this is one of those rare cases where the best interests of the child must take precedence over the policy goal of deterring parental wrongdoing
7095161 canada was the more appropriate forum to resolve this matter
7095162 the majority rewards the kidnapper and encourages others by equating unlawful frustration of family court jurisdiction with the best interests of the child
7095163 the canadian courts judgment rested on a relatively recent comprehensive evaluation of the emotional and physical health of the mother and the child the childs adjustment at school and the likely emotional impact on the child of an abrupt reunification with father
7095164 while mothers criminal interference with fathers parent child contact was extraordinary she demonstrated no extraordinary circumstances warranting relief from the family courts order on jurisdiction
7095165 theres no way to compel the kid to come down here
7095166 the child is now old enough to make his own decisions about where he goes and who he lives with as a practical matter the ruling changes nothing
7095167 obviously michelle is pleased with the decision and that the court agreed with our legal analysis but thats all were going to say

7095172 new documents from within the bush administration and us intelligence community during the run up to the invasion of iraq reveal that the white house began assembling a case for war before it had compiled the intel that ostensibly formed the basis of that case
7095173 ich bin entt uscht es ging um ein paar hunderstelsekunden aber trotzdem ist klar dass wir in valencia nicht so stark sind wie bei den letzten rennen
7095174 man muss sich nur anschauen wo die red bull mit dem gleichen motor stehen das kann kein zufall sein
7095175 uns fehlt der speed in den schikanen ich verliere meine ganze zeit im ersten sektor weil wir nicht genug speed in die langsamen kurven mit reinnehmen k nnen
7095176 valencia ist ein stra enkurs da kann viel passieren vielleicht kommt das safety car f r mich mal zu einem g nstigen zeitpunkt auf die strecke
7095177 i wish wed scored more goals because we had plenty of chances
7095178 but if we play like this and allow so few chances theres not much to complain about
7095179 weve had a great start and the top of the standings looks good but we are not naive to think that it will continue like this well be able to tell more after 10 rounds
7095180 we have to be happy with the point but well have to get three next week
7095181 we gave away too much possession in the second half
7095182 i am pleased with the way we played but im angry that we spoiled it at the end by allowing a goal
7095183 the result is justified we showed that we are hard to beat
7095184 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7095185 the major towns of the agency like khar raghagan hajilawant jar and others were completely deserted no sign of life was seen there some of the houses and a religious seminary near jar village had been dashed to the ground after being hit by missiles fired from gunship helicopters or jet fighters that were used in the operation
7095186 they the military are not hitting the known targets of the militants but blitzing the civilian abodes
7095187 around 30 people were killed in our village during the operation which forced us to leave the town
7095188 i am in a miserable condition here in the camp but i cannot return to our home due to continued shelling which has already wounded my daughter and destroyed our house
7095189 we arrived here this morning as our village nawagai was heavily shelled by gunship helicopters
7095190 pitiable as they did not have the required facilities including power potable water toilets etc
7095191 the internally displaced people of bajaur said the troops did not target the militant centres which are located at stone throws distance from their bases
7095192 rather the helicopters and artillery target the civilian population resulting in mounting civilian casualties
7095193 no one can deny the fact that pakistan and afghanistan are the gateway to the rich oil and gas reserves of the central asian republics
7095194 the war on terror was started to gain control of these reserves
7095195 if it the offensive in the fata doesnt stop we will continue such attacks the wah factory is a killer factory where arms are being produced to kill our women and children
7095196 the pro us policies pursued by the musharraf led regime
7095197 you must be getting tired do you want to keep telling stories
7095198 yes i was even dreaming about granny when you walked in
7095199 then granny said dixie theres something ive always wanted to tell you but never hav e and then you woke me up
7095200 dadurch haben wir die olympischen spiele erst richtig zu sch tzen gelernt
7095201 das war eine ganz normale strafecke du haust halt drauf und die kugel ist drin
7095202 haben die meisten von uns die grunds tzlichen sachen gelernt und markus weise hat jetzt eben noch das sahneh ubchen drauf gesetzt
7095203 die marktf hrer im westen sollten sich diese agilen lokalen unternehmen genau ansehen
7095204 viele m ssen feststellen dass prall gef llte kassen breite patentportfolios und bew hrte gesch ftsstrategien nicht ausreichen um diese firmen zu bezwingen
7095205 f r die kinder sorgen auf die ganze familie fokussieren
7095206 es ist nur eine frage der zeit bis lokale champions aus china auf dem weltmarkt angreifen
7095207 the booing was perfectly understandable because we are the world champions and we cannot afford to lose two in a row its unacceptable to play like that
7095208 it was all about execution because the chances were there but we cannot make mistakes like we did today its unacceptable for any international player
7095209 you drive the car ill f ck him in the back seat
7095210 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
7095211 so they could live their lives in a setting thats much more natural and with the hope that some may eventually be returned to their home in the wild
7095212 the plan for the facility would be to turn it into a virtual reality park

7095215 no ha habido hasta ahora peor cr tico de la falta de experiencia de barack obama que el propio joe biden

7095217 thou sayest that i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth every one that is of the the truth heareth my voice
7095218 where are you getting all of this info from or how did you come up with that answer when the book clearly states
7095219 democracy is little more than the system by which 51 percent of the people can pee in the cornflakes of 49 percent of the people
7095220 it could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no distinctly american criminal class except congress
7095221 the difference between death and taxes is death doesnt get worse every time congress meets
7095222 the budget should be balanced the treasury should be refilled public debt should be reduced the arrogance of officialdom should be tempered and controlled and the assistance to foreign lands should be curtailed lest rome become bankrupt people must again learn to work instead of living on public assistance
7095223 we hang the petty thieves and appoint the great ones to public office
7095224 a government big enough to give you everything you want is strong enough to take everything you have
7095225 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
7095226 we have triumphed gaza won its independence from the west bank one people now have two states two prisons who dont greet each other we are victims dressed in executioners clothing

7095502 we want roots reggae to regain the marley period level of appreciation
7095503 marley was very much about his musical development and artists like tarrus are trying to emulate what happened during that time
7095504 play our music a cut above how it sounds on the record
7095505 i like tarrus to be backed by a full ensemble horn section percussionists harmonies
7095506 but economics plays a great part in our music not being properly heard a lot of artists are scared to say i am not going to perform without my musicians because they dont want to risk not working but it is a necessary sacrifice for the development of the music
7095507 basically we revoiced tracks from movement on popular riddims in dub plate style and then built them into a mix with other dubs from popular artists

7095514 there are broadcast channels where you can listen to the traffic audibly with this you can listen to music and see the traffic info pop up this will show red yellow or green lines to show the flow of traffic as it happens
7095515 that gives an indication that its not just cadillac and lexus that offers this
7095516 its integrated into the car you can use it in a seemless way
7095517 nissan does it very well so does cadillac ford does it with sync which adds a level of voice control scion has it in at least two of its cars
7095518 its no trick to get that in an expensive car but in a ford focus scion or moderately priced nissan it is
7095519 nissan ford and scion have made a point at looking at what customers really want they want high tech gadgety things

7095530 i just decided it would be great to bring them with me
7095531 my vision and my dream was to have four gold medals around my neck by the time we finished the last game here in beijing
7095532 to have four gold medals obviously shows a level of dominance ive been able to participate in with so many great players
7095533 it would be shameful to try to take all the credit for myself because ive had so many awesome teammates
7095534 so for me i just pass that on to my teammates that are going on in the future to represent our country
7095535 we werent going to be the team to let lisa lose we wouldnt let her olympic career end that way
7095536 to lose by 30 against a quality team we believed we could win the gold medal against the usa you have to play a 40 minute game
7095537 we didnt play 40 minutes we shot the ball terrible defense has been one of our strengths through the tournament but we just werent great on our d today
7095538 weve said from day one that top to bottom we are a deep team
7095539 we just send wave after wave of players at you

7095545 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7095546 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7095547 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7095548 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7095549 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7095550 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7095551 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7095552 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7095560 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7095561 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7095562 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

7095570 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7095571 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7095572 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7095573 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7095574 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7095575 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7095576 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
7095577 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7095578 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados

7095589 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7095590 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7095591 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7095592 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7095593 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7095594 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7095595 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7095596 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
7095597 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7095598 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7095599 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7095600 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7095601 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7095602 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7095603 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta

7095616 we were a bit disappointed with the way we handled the situation there dambulla
7095617 we wanted to execute certain plans which we couldnt but that game has gone the wicket and conditions are different here and all the batsmen are ready for the challenge
7095618 it is a different wicket and looks firm the ball will probably come nicely on to the bat so definitely there will be more runs it is all about getting used to the conditions and the performance on the day
7095619 in one day cricket bowlers do come into the play create opportunities and put pressure but batsmen have more responsibility as they are the ones who control the game because runs on the board are vital
7095620 he has been bowling for the last two days and looking good right now he has a very good chance of playing the match on sunday
7095621 he and murali have been doing the job for us for a long time to get 400 wickets is a great achievement
7095622 both the young players virat kohli and badrinath played really well in the last match
7095623 it was good to see young players coming in and feeling comfortable in the international set up its very important for indian cricket that we have competition for places
7095624 we are discussing various combinations at the moment and would like to be pretty flexible we will take it game by game
7095625 i am very excited olympic gold and record what more could i want
7095626 i had just enough energy to make the break i did that for the people of ethiopia
7095627 i came here as the underdog because of the times i ran so far this year
7095628 its been a good night for kenya we have done something good here for our country
7095629 i knew she jamal would be very strong and i had to work hard to win
7095630 you can see from this tournament how we need to upgrade the level of the judges
7095631 we need re education and re training to achieve a higher level no more cheating no more manipulation but better referee judges
7095632 i will be the first to admit that not every point scored in boxing is recorded
7095633 there will be points missed but we know most of the time that the right boxer wins the contest
7095634 for 20 years this has been an organisation that has been under a cloud of suspicion but we have seen in the last year or so under the new reforms that that suspicion has been largely reduced
7095635 considering the circumstances the boks were in they were quite desperate after last week this is a significant win
7095636 weve had a tough time of it in the last few years not winning here since 2000 and the fact its always difficult so were very satisfied
7095637 were simply not hanging on to the ball for more than three phases if we can keep the ball then we can turn it around its very disappointing but theres no time to waste we have to go back and work on the mistakes were making on the field
7095638 we again created good opportunities but just didnt carry it through the guys must just believe in themselves
7095639 it has been a blessing for me to be out on this court
7095640 i havent necessarily played great during this tournament tonight i got into some foul trouble as did diana taurasi and katie smith but we fought hard and we beat australia

7095643 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras

7095649 we see a lot of atv injuries weve been seeing them more as the economys been booming out here and were seeing them in all age groups not just young kids
7095650 people are going to start crying saying its a provincial regulation because its transportation related and we dont want the feds involved
7095651 yet youve got a patchwork framework across the country that is not only very confusing but is not based on any science whatsoever
7095652 its based on public opinion and its based on political lack of will to do anything about the issue
7095653 one of the things that we would like to see and were part of a national association is a little bit of standardization going on
7095654 the regulations are so fractured across this country its hard to keep track
7095655 we definitely need to pull this all together across the country
7095656 instead of saying these are dangerous vehicles or high risk vehicles so dont use them maybe we should be focusing on the vehicles themselves why are they high risk what can be done with them from a product safety point of view
7095657 the question i think has to be raised from a federal point of view from product safety are these safe recreational products

7095682 es cierto que las im genes de periodistas persiguiendo a los familiares de los muertos son vergonzosas que por encima de la informaci n irrelevante del detalle escabroso est siempre la dignidad de las personas pero tengo la sensaci n de que hay una hiperreacci n de la sociedad ante la prensa que nos puede llevar a otro extremo tan o m s peligroso que el amarillismo sanguinolento ese mundo donde la muerte de 153 personas es una simple cifra una estad stica

7095686 support the prudent and calibrated use of all instruments of united states national power in iraq including diplomatic economic intelligence and military instruments in support of the policy with respect to the government of the islamic republic of iran and its proxies
7095687 the united states should designate the islamic revolutionary guards corps as a foreign terrorist organization and place the islamic revolutionary guards corps on the list of specially designated global terrorists
7095688 iran through the use of the iranian republican guard corps quds force seeks to turn the shiia militia extremists into a hezbollah like force to serve its interests and fight a proxy war against the iraqi state and coalition forces in iraq
7095689 the political power of the occupiers the united states and allied foreign forces in iraq is collapsing rapidly soon we will see a huge power vacuum in the region of course we are prepared to fill the gap
7095690 biden said the best deterrent to prevent pre emptive military action in iran is to make it clear even if it is at the end of his final term action will be taken against bush to ensure his legacy will be marred for all time

7095696 its sad it was his choice and were here to support him
7095697 at least these guys are getting a better send off than vietnam
7095698 we just want them to know were thinking of them
7095699 we ask you to be a shield and protector for them
7095700 will you give them rapid success in their mission to bring peace to the people of iraq and bring them home safely and securely to their families
7095701 domestic violence is a dreadful crime that can be difficult to escape
7095702 its critical that we provide a support network to help victims get out of violent situations
7095703 they are really strapped when they want to find help if theyve been abused or people have stolen from them
7095704 it sounds like a very positive and serious idea that would create a safer environment for domestic violence victims and assist prosecutors in bringing perpetrators to justice
7095705 i think any time you can combine services to better serve the needs of those in harms way we are doing the right thing

7095717 the governor has indicated that obama did not select him as a running mate
7095718 senator obama has made an outstanding selection in joe biden
7095719 strong leader fierce advocate and devoted family man with values rooted in the best of what american stands for
7095720 joe biden has been fighting his entire career for the change that senator obama champions
7095721 a sage voice on many of the toughest foreign policy issues of our time and has long been a strong advocate for protecting american families and making our communities safer
7095722 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7095723 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7095724 i just think were not getting into the details of the tick tock
7095725 its probably about 8 inches of water inside the first floor which is very dangerous at this time its just too dangerous to keep these people here
7095726 much as i love flowers flushing the toilets is a higher
7095727 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7095728 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7095729 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7095730 its been a really tough day an emotional roller coaster
7095731 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7095732 its a blessing for me to be out on this floor now participating in my fourth olympics and walking away with a fourth gold medal
7095733 weve said from day one that top to bottom we are a deep team
7095734 we just send wave after wave of players at you
7095735 we werent going to be the team to let lisa lose
7095736 you cant shoot less than 40 percent and expect to win gold medals

7095741 we couldnt and we havent found any identification showing they are taliban
7095742 the coalition forces have made mistakes so many times and killed so many civilians we are asking president karzai to come here
7095743 on such a serious allegation as this one we have to look into it
7095744 were just trying to get to the bottom of this
7095745 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7095746 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7095747 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
7095748 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
7095749 this is in fact not the case and all shared levels in the game will be available worldwide the confusion arose out of regional differences in how moderation will work as there are different legal rules each region have to play by and at one point this looked like it may require the game to be independent in each region however this has been worked around and there will only be one region for the game a littlebigregion
7095750 if you have reasonable suspicion that a person is concealing contraband thats reason to strip search someone
7095751 the county is going to have to pay everyone they illegally strip search
7095752 the only question is how much they have to pay
7095753 every person who was booked during the time when this happened can recover something
7095754 there have been new procedures for more than a year now because this lawsuit brought it to the sheriffs attention that the procedures they were using werent up to constitutional standing
7095755 weve settled a fair number and we have a few pending still
7095756 our office has become somewhat of a specialist in this area
7095757 when he opens no one shall shut when he shuts no one shall open
7095758 the definitive time has arrived in which to constitute the new people of god the people of the twelve tribes which now becomes a universal people his church
7095759 were in iraq as a result of a democracy asking for us to come in there
7095760 john mccain is a war hero he deserves a capuccino when he wants one
7095761 he went 5 and a half years without a latte when he was in the hanoi hilton
7095762 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7095763 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7095764 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7095765 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7095766 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7095767 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7095768 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7095769 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7095770 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7095771 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7095772 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7095773 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7095774 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7095775 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7095776 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7095777 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7095778 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7095779 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7095780 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7095781 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7095782 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7095783 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7095784 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7095785 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7095786 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7095787 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7095788 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7095789 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7095790 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7095791 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7095792 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7095793 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7095794 es un jugador que resulta muy adecuado en este momento para las necesidades del real zaragoza tiene experiencia es polivalente y un jugador de equipo

7095800 mi principal preocupaci n ahora es estar con mis compa eros jugar y empezar el campeonato con buen pie
7095801 el mercado est como est y habr que esperar hasta el final pero la semana que viene habr muchas novedades
7095802 el equipo ha recibido ingresos de la venta de aimar lafita scar y adem s el zaragoza est reconstruyendo la plantilla pensando en las pr ximas dos temporadas
7095803 est respondiendo a las necesidades que el entrenador ha puesto sobre la mesa
7095804 yo fui desde el na tico hasta la expo en ebrob s y la verdad es que el recorrido en barco fue muy tranquilo y c modo ahora tengo ganas de recorrer el r o en uno de los ecopatines que han puesto hoy
7095805 va desde el embarcadero hasta unos 250 metros antes de llegar a la desembocadura del huerva
7095806 no nos hemos atrevido a sacarlos y hemos preferido esperar
7095807 hemos pensado sacar primero los ecopatines porque cuentan con m s aceptaci n pero seguramente la pr xima semana la gente tambi n dispondr de los remos
7095808 tendr a que haber estado a disposici n del p blico a mediados de junio
7095809 these vessels are a key priority of the government of canada
7095810 however the government must ensure that canadian taxpayers receive the best value for their money
7095811 if the federal government lower the petrol price will you support them
7095812 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7095813 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7095814 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7095815 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7095816 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7095817 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7095818 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7095819 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7095820 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7095821 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7095822 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7095823 no en absoluto se va a dictar una emergencia econ mica en la provincia
7095824 lo primero que le digo es que el primer sentimiento que me causa es sorpresa porque nosotros desde que nos reunimos con los legisladores la gobernadora no me manifest ninguna especie vinculante con lo manifestado por velazquez con esta situaci n
7095825 en absoluto se est gestionando ninguna especie que tenga que ver con una emergencia econ mica pero eso no obsta que la situaci n no es holgada o critica y que no pasa por este saneamiento una emergencia aunque no est en la cabeza de la gobernadora o de este ministro hacer una emergencia
7095826 tambi n nos vemos expuestos al trabajo de atenci n de personas privadas de la libertad y asumiendo los mismos riesgos que los profesionales que si son alcanzados por este aumento
7095827 el aumento parece direccionado por que en uno de los tem alcanza solo a una persona que es el director del patronato el se or zoraide
7095828 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7095829 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7095830 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7095831 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7095832 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7095833 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7095834 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7095835 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7095836 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7095837 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7095838 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7095839 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7095840 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7095841 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7095842 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

7095852 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7095853 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7095854 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7095855 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7095856 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7095857 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7095858 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7095859 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7095860 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7095861 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7095862 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7095863 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7095864 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7095865 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7095866 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7095867 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7095868 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7095869 i could have opted to seek political asylum in america but i feel it is my duty as it is the duty of every filipino to suffer with his people especially in time of crisis i never sought nor have i been given any assurances or promise of leniency by the regime i return voluntarily armed only with a clear conscience and fortified in the faith that in the end justice will emerge triumphant
7095870 im sure the tragedy of this circumstance will hit all of those communities
7095871 all of you know what kind of people they are
7095872 siempre alguien del p blico sube al escenario regalamos pitos nos vestimos de colores nos ponemos nuestros gorros nuestras m scaras contamos chistes
7095873 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7095874 in all my years of direct and indirect participation i never witnessed nor even heard of an aircraft loss where the wreckage was accessible that prevented investigators from finding enough hard evidence to positively identify the make model and specific registration number of the aircraft and in most cases the precise cause of the accident
7095875 is being touted by the media as a man of principle yet he was involved with other women while married to his first wife and was implicated in the so called keating scandal with four other senators he was eventually reprimanded by the congress for the appearance of impropriety the senator reportedly has a violent temper and can be extremely confrontational and profane when angry these red flags about senator mccains character are reminiscent of the man who now occupies the white house
7095876 speaking as a private individual i would not vote for john mccain under any circumstances

7095879 designers who focus on producing only meek and sustainable things are denying their own creativity and impact on the world
7095880 what underpins the general shift towards green design is a widespread sense of guilt and self doubt felt by many designers about blighting the world with too much stuff the paradox is that the big idea they turn to for salvation environmentalism means that rather than endeavouring to produce something new to solve the problem one that makes use of the best possible processes ideas and resources designers will attempt to regain a sense of purpose and credibility by preaching to the rest of us to lower our horizons
7095881 isnt design always about making an impact not according to the green design movement or the design deniers who argue for placing limits on human ingenuity and creativity put bluntly they want less of it not more of course there is no ignoring climate change while the science causes and effects are by no means given as discussed many times on spiked placing limits on ingenuity will itself deny us imaginative and mature solutions the greening of design will only contribute to more climate change panic if our hands are tied in finding the best means to deal with a warming world
7095882 and amongst all the debate about limits there is something else under attack something distinctively human that is tied up with the idea of the designer the degradation of objectivity
7095883 every so often moments do arise which push the boundaries a bit further or if you are lucky by a long way thats called
7095884 um you know i always get my pull box i always buy at least 2 3 other impulse items and i often spend an hour or two here kibbitzing with you as well as all the neighborhood d amp d kids who buy at most a pack or two of magic cards every few weeks yet sit and game at the free tables daily so why dont you come off that 12 00 and let me have thor 11 at cover price seeing as how the truck just left

7095886 spirituality in its essence is the direct experience in ones own consciousness and ones whole being of oneness of all existance without the least doubt or wavering awareness of such oneness in ones own consciousness without any feeling of separateness with any thing in the universe such awareness is said to have two stages not necessarily one after the other the perception of oneness which is attended by a momentary sense of fulfillment and ecstatic joy
7095887 having made a ceaseless effort to attain self purification i have developed some little capacity to hear correctly and clearly the still small voice within
7095888 return to the roots of consciousness as mysticism makes inroads to higher feeling
7095889 an abiding force to see inwardly and see in fullness
7095890 to feel within oneself the spirit of joy arising out of the sense of goodness and love derived by means of non violence as the symbol of mystic contentment
7095891 there is a spirit which i feel delights to do no evil nor to revenge any wrong but delights to endure all things as it bears no evil in itself so it conceives none in thought to any other if it be betrayed it bears it for its ground and spring is the mercies and forgiveness of god

7095902 mccains fundamental problem is theres only one way home for him replicate the bush electoral victory state by state
7095903 the fundamental truth remains that this race is extremely tight mccain is in strong position in ohio and florida two states that have been critical for republican victories and hes better positioned today in michigan than the president was in either 2000 or 2004

7095907 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7095908 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7095909 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7095910 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7095911 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7095912 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7095913 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7095914 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7095915 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7095916 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7095917 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7095918 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7095919 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7095920 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7095921 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7095922 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7095923 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7095924 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7095925 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7095926 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7095927 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7095928 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7095929 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7095930 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7095931 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7095932 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7095933 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7095934 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7095935 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7095936 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7095937 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7095938 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7095939 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7095940 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7095941 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7095942 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7095943 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7095944 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7095945 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7095946 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7095947 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7095948 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7095949 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7095950 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7095951 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7095952 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7095953 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7095954 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7095955 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7095956 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7095957 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7095958 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7095959 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7095960 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7095961 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7095962 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7095963 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7095964 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7095965 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7095966 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7095967 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7095968 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7095969 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7095970 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7095971 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7095972 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7095973 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7095974 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7095975 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7095976 don diego nombre real de berna yo iba mucho con jorge noguera all pero que yo recuerde tres veces significativas pero mire don diego lo importante es que uribe no aguanta un testimonio m o hoy d a que yo d una entrevista por ejemplo en el washington post uribe no la aguanta
7095977 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7095978 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7095979 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7095980 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7095981 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7095982 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7095983 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7095984 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7095985 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7095986 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7095987 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7095988 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7095989 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7095990 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7095991 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7095992 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7095993 this is a planning took where all things are going
7095994 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7095995 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7095996 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7095997 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

7096017 she would describe an experiment and say thanks to allah it turned out well
7096018 what we have learned from her is that she was in custody for over five years
7096019 i have no doubt that there really are real terrorists out there but she isnt one of them
7096020 shes a dangerous person with a lot of ability and the investigation will show how far along she may have been with any plot
7096021 something that strikes my heart remarkably closely is the parents and their kids and how parents take trust for substance the part sexual model that brought their nursling to this point

7096026 that commission of any act of impropriety in the future will merit a more severe penalty
7096027 the omissions of respondent violated section 5 canon 6 of the new code of judicial conduct for the philippine judiciary judges are mandated to perform all judicial duties efficiently fairly and with reasonable promptness in other words judges should never cause judicial delay
7096028 delay derails the administration of justice it postpones the rectification of wrong and the vindication of the unjustly prosecuted it crowds the dockets of the courts increasing the costs for all litigants pressuring judges to take short cuts interfering with the prompt and deliberate disposition of those causes in which all parties are diligent and prepared for trial and overhanging the entire process with the pall of disorganization and insolubility
7096029 the milf did not want to be bound by our constitution
7096030 on the basis of that document you do not carry the full power of the president your authority is only based on the document
7096031 it is a consensus that the moa will be signed but the government has not yet given anyone the authority to sign the moa since wala pang there is no go signal from the government to sign the moa even if it has been signed it will not be binding
7096032 with the absence of the signature of the people who are authorized to sign it is not yet a perfected document
7096033 how many participated in the three plebiscites for inclusion in the armm dont you think that is enough consultation done by the government regarding the inclusion
7096034 they have been consulted three times they said yes but are overwhelmed by the rest of the province
7096035 in the last two plebiscites the subject matter was armm autonomous region in muslim mindanao right
7096036 and armm the organic act of armm does not provide that the armm will have its internal police security force its own courts its own comelec correct
7096037 so can that 1989 and 2001 plebiscite be considered consultation will that consultation apply now in the bje bangsamoro juridical entity concept
7096038 your prayer is mandamus that you be given a copy of the moa ad and prohibit the government from entering into the agreement correct
7096039 so the first prayer is already granted because you already have copy of it
7096040 the second relief that you are asking does not require the milf to be a party correct direct the prohibition against the government
7096041 it is the duty of the supreme court to guide the peace panel in formulating the best agreement

7096077 we enjoyed playing in the rca dome coach tony dungy said
7096078 it was good for us we knew that facility very well and it was nice and loud for us so we had that going but it was also about a lot of good players playing well and thats what we have to have at the new place
7096079 i think its going to be a great time for us to get started on a new year a fresh year said bob sanders last years nfl defensive player of the year
7096080 guys are coming back i think its just all around great for this city and this state to bring a new stadium here and have us start doing bigger things
7096081 the first couple of games you only get about 15 plays
7096082 so far its gone pretty good except for getting field goals instead of touchdowns
7096083 it was very difficult and it is very difficult to get motivated but with the help of friends family and my agent we just keep pressing on losman said
7096084 you have to keep looking at that light you have to keep saying something could happen and you have to be ready for it
7096085 we got better as an offense bills offensive coordinator turk schonert said

7096089 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world the finnish driver said
7096090 i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time
7096091 its a good starting position for us tomorrow hamilton said
7096092 felipes going to be hard to beat tomorrow but well certainly push for it
7096093 i am understandably disappointed with the qualifying session because i had other hopes for today alonso said
7096094 the race tomorrow will therefore be more difficult but as were on a street course anything is possible in the race
7096095 this was a very good qualifying for the team and me said kubica who is fourth in the standings with 49 points
7096096 after some unlucky races lately the pace of the car here in valencia is not that bad however there is a small gap to ferrari and mclaren
7096097 i think its a wide open race said eoin harty well armeds trainer

7096107 whereas obama has an image of being cool biden perhaps will never be considered cool hes a man of passion
7096108 when somebody holds you up on the street and takes your wallet we call it robbery

7096132 our just and genuine struggle for right of self determination and freedom has entered a decisive and critical phase after decades of struggle trials and tribulations and today people irrespective of age and gender are out on the streets giving open vent to their yearning for freedom
7096133 this should be an eye opener for the forces and elements who indulge in propaganda of normalcy and peace
7096134 like the people all pro freedom leaders are united and it is with unity that we can carry the blood nourished movement to its logical conclusion
7096135 though we are a small nation our will and determination are towering no amount of force and violence can suppress the iron will of a people
7096136 this movement is a continuation of the plebiscite campaign and the kashmiri people will accept nothing less
7096137 the united nations should accept the current movement as a referendum and ensure the implementation of the resolutions passed in connection with the kashmir issue

7096154 i was brought over here hargeisa this morning at 7 00am and as you can see my body is swollen all over and i remain chained to my bed
7096155 i was never brought to trial to which i am rightfully entitled as a citizen it was only very recently that the prison commander informed me that i was sentenced to two year s imprisonment by the so called national security committee even though no one had ever spoken to me about this i have yet to see any papers relating to my imprisonment although i was held in prison for the last three months

7096180 really if we live in a just world this will be the end of joe biden s political career
7096181 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7096182 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7096183 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent
7096184 thats where we are today in the middle of a financial crisis with the economy sliding into recession with monetary policy at maximum easing and fiscal transfers impotent
7096185 more than a year into the most challenging financial crisis of our times we now face a complex and interlocking combination of rising inflation declining growth tightening credit conditions and widespread liquidity tensions
7096186 these adjustments will not be painless and ensuring that they take place in an orderly manner will pose substantial challenges for policymakers
7096187 it was a brief conversation theyve known each other for years

7096192 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
7096193 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
7096194 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
7096195 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
7096196 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
7096197 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
7096198 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
7096199 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
7096200 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
7096201 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
7096202 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
7096203 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence

7096329 where decency and endurance and the pioneer spirit were joined at the hip with conformity and suspicion and the potential for unblinking cruelty
7096330 but that was the age difference and not that she was mean or anything
7096331 generally shunned the tent revival circuit preferring a straight backed form of methodism that valued reason over passion and temperance over both
7096332 blanched whenever someone mentioned the subject and hoped to carry the secret to her grave

7096340 here you graduated from college so you should be able to figure out this file

7096343 never stopped dreaming of a house with a white picket fence days spent baking or playing bridge or volunteering at the local library
7096344 your grandfather and i just figured we should treat people decently bar
7096345 shes wise that way my grandmother suspicious of overwrought sentiments or overblown claims content with common sense
7096346 before you came in she told me the fella was black thats the real reason why shes bothered
7096347 never had they given me reason to doubt their love i doubted if they ever would
7096348 and yet i knew that men who might easily have been my brothers could still inspire their rawest fears
7096349 than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe
7096350 she was really a very liberal person liberal in politics and i think liberal in thinking
7096351 frankly that story when it was in the book i felt didnt need to be in there

7096644 this is not a judgment of what a group of elite though very well informed reporters think its what people think in their living rooms in iowa what do they think in california the public is going to make a judgment
7096645 one of the reasons were in trouble is the last eight to 12 years both political parties have concluded youve got to be able to get your whole platform down to a bumper sticker
7096646 but things are much more complicated and serious than that im going to treat the american people with respect im going to give them my rationale im not going to assume they cant understand it

7096648 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent

7096655 the american bishops have instructed catholic voters to consider many issues but have characterized the defense of human life as foundational and have explained that the issue has a special claim on the conscience of the catholic voter this means that a political candidate like biden because of his strong support for abortion rights forfeits any claim for support despite his views on other issues like health care and the economy

7096674 what has been done until now has been pretty well done it seems to me under those very difficult circumstances
7096675 how are we to answer the many desperate bitter questions and complaints why doesnt the church do anything why does it permit the nameless injustices to go on how can it time and again pay joyous tribute to the national socialists and offer political endorsements to a government that persecutes some of its own members why does it not at least protect the children how could it be that everything that is simply incompatible with the nowadays much maligned humaneness could be compatible with christianity

7096680 datacenter is where you go when you need the highest level of availability
7096681 but you get it through services and not the server operating system alone
7096682 we have a mainframe we have sun and all those other products but having looked for unix and mainframe resources i know thats not as easy a task as finding people to support the windows architecture
7096683 lets say i typically get a spike on internet traffic at 10 a m and 2 p m if i need to allocate two additional gigabytes of memory or more processors i can do that based on load
7096684 these are not necessarily things you can do with an os other than datacenter
7096685 if you need a low end server youre usually looking for lowest cost
7096686 our servers arent huge with unbelievable levels of sophistication so the standard server product serves our needs

7096690 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee watch the first obama biden rally live at 3pm et on spread the word
7096691 sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7096692 joe biden brings extensive foreign policy experience an impressive record of collaborating across party lines and a direct approach to getting the job done
7096693 the most important question is is this person prepared to be president second most important question from my perspective is can this person help me govern are they gonna be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally and the third criteria from me i think was independence i want somebody who is gonna be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a a yes person when it comes to policies
7096694 perhaps the most notable example of that came in january 2007 when biden announced his second candidacy for president
7096695 rather than spending the day boasting of his qualifications biden spent much of it extricating himself from remarks he made about obama having called him the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7096696 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7096703 i saw the problem we wrote a letter to google ceo signed by mort klein pres and susan tuchman esq
7096704 israel is being specifically targeted no one else is running a campaign against a country like this google needs to review their policy for the community content layer perhaps dividing it up or further restricting it to content about current significant locations and landmarks

7096747 we suspect foul play how come they the boys could go out in the night despite strict security in the ashram our children had no bad habits police told us they found rs1 100 in their pockets where did the money come from we never gave them the money the claims of gurukul authorities are patently false
7096748 my son was killed by someone from the ashram who used black magic the bodies of the two boys had several injury marks at different places dipeshs head had been shaved off he was completely bald before being killed
7096749 we have been looking for them when some of their friends told us that the two boys were very keen to see the rath yatra we searched for them in the yatra too they police refused to register a case immediately when we reported about the two boys who went missing from the gurukul they told us to wait for a day
7096750 someone from the ashram might have persuaded the boys to venture out of the ashram
7096751 he just came for a short visit and left in due course
7096752 without any compulsion and its effect will be felt all over gujarat

7096763 as a company we are in the process of obtaining an organic industrial license theres a long protocol to comply which should allow textiles working with organic wool to supply them with the necessary certification to a market willing to pay for the extra bonus
7096764 but not for the whole of the clip but a reasonable percentage
7096765 we know some farms are already moving towards the organic certification process so we estimate that not too long from now we should be able to supply the world uruguayan wool stamped with the organic seal

7096767 many times we hear speeches about how uruguay looks after new investors but they seem to forget a huge investment in land sheep technology textiles supported by 10 million sheep in which uruguayans have been investing for decades
7096768 its time to eliminate this levy which dates back to over half a century
7096769 the meager value of the us dollar the increase in taxes public utility rates and a lowering of the tax reimbursement system are increasingly punishing sheep farming and industry and this is particularly intense when all the production is exported and theres no domestic market to help absorb with an unprecedented appreciation of the peso the consequences of dollar inflation
7096770 but overseas clients wont pay for our inefficiencies be them productive monetary or financial

7096794 we are against it because violence can never be a solution
7096795 the conflict will never end and it will not bring peace
7096796 it has become emotional because these areas are already populated or contiguous to a christian majority population the uproar has reached dangerous emotional limits and was escalating
7096797 we decided to convene a cross section of the mindanao society last august 13 to listen to the explanation of the real nature and purpose of the moa by the government and the officials of the moro islamic liberation front milf
7096798 what was clarified to the satisfaction of many was the fact that the moa was simply a joint plant to consult certain areas of mindanao which the milf claim to have been historically a part of their ancestral domain
7096799 the agreement has yet to be approved by congress and by means of an enabling act
7096800 that only after the plebiscite will the final peace agreement be discussed to bring about what is called the bangsamoro juridical entity bje which shall be a new recognized muslim autonomous region within the territory of the republic
7096801 cha cha shall ostensibly commence the shift to federalism to accommodate the demands of the bangsamoro peoples call for autonomy but it shall only help perpetuate the arroyo regime in power further than 2010
7096802 we mga iskolar ng bayan will never condone the atrocities arroyo and her cohorts have committed against the people while we unite with the bangsamoro peoples quest for genuine autonomy and peace we also seek gloria ouster as instrumental to ending both the bangsamoro people and the filipino peoples plight
7096803 we strongly condemn the arroyo administration for intensifying the conflict with our moro brothers as a result of its double speak and ulterior motives
7096804 on our fellow youth to be ever vigilant against attempts to attack our freedoms and civil liberties
7096805 first charter change then arroyo and her militarist thinking advisers are now manipulating the mindanao conflict to sow an atmosphere of panic and chaos even in manila and other regions

7096818 our troops have performed brilliantly in iraq but no amount of american soldiers can solve the political differences at the heart of somebody elses civil war
7096819 thats why i have introduced a plan to not only stop the escalation of this war but begin a phased redeployment that can pressure the iraqis to finally reach a political settlement and reduce the violence

7096834 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7096835 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7096836 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7096837 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7096838 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7096839 cheney has essentially been called a co president or by some critics a secret president
7096840 the president of vice president has become much more powerful and certainly anyone who would be looking at taking the number two position on the ticket would certainly think i might have a broader portfolio i might have the opportunity to have a real impact on the administration policies

7096855 republican always always campaign by protraying the democratic candidate as an out of touch elitist
7096856 democrats in general and obama in particular have trouble connecting with working class voters
7096857 mccain s a graduate of annapolis i know a lot of the annapolis breed remember i m west point where i was born my father went there
7096858 so the obama campaign is going all out on the issue of mccain s multiple houses isn t that kind of stupid

7096862 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7096863 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7096864 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7096865 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7096866 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7096867 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7096868 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7096869 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7096870 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7096871 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7096872 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7096873 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7096874 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7096875 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7096876 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7096877 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7096878 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7096879 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7096880 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7096881 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7096882 toen we aankwamen ondervroegen ze niet iedereen slechts enkelen werden apart genomen
7096883 ze namen ons mee naar een douche ruimte ze zeiden dat we onze kleren uit moesten doen en onze schoenen die we met de veters aan elkaar vast moesten binden
7096884 my wife is tired shes just given birth and we are on the run with a newborn and a three year old the tactics that have been pulled so far are unbelievable
7096885 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49kg and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
7096886 a lot of dangers and lot of big questions marks
7096887 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
7096888 we are talking a potentially major and awful outcome for this child and it is our job to protect children when they cant make decisions for themselves
7096889 about 30 per cent of people with hepatitis b will develop cancer or cirrhosis and die young i dont understand why these people are willing to sacrifice their child for a warped idea when the benefits far outweigh the risks

7096894 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7096895 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7096896 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7096897 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7096898 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7096899 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7096900 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7096901 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7096902 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7096903 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7096904 the bush administration and its congressional allies have helped their friends in industry by enacting weak environmental health and consumer regulations and arguing that they wipe out more robust state protections
7096905 blocked states from regulating most abuse by private medicare insurance plans
7096906 one of the bitterest pre emption battles has been over chemical plant safety a terrorist strike on a big chemical plant could injure or kill hundreds or even thousands of americans the chemical industry has succeeded however in blocking mandatory federal safety requirements when new jersey imposed its own reasonable rules the industry and the administration went into overdrive fighting fiercely so far unsuccessfully to pass a federal law pre empting new jerseys safety requirements
7096907 if its working senator do you now have a better estimate of when american forces can come home from iraq
7096908 but the key to it is that we dont want any more americans in harms way that way they will be safe and serve our country and come home with honor and victory not in defeat which is what senator obamas proposal would have done im proud of them and theyre doing a great job and we are succeeding and its fascinating that senator obama still doesnt realize that
7096909 the number of incidents in the week ending may 23 was around 300 down from a high of nearly 1600 in mid june 2007
7096910 in case you havent followed this underreported story some members of congress and even some folks in helena want to take away our ability to manage our own water in montana and across the country
7096911 tak ing the side of extreme environmental groups who contend that the federal government should apply the standards of the clean water act to all waters in montana from our major rivers on down to stock ponds and irrigation ditches
7096912 but now we face a crossroads and the federal government is moving to take over regulation of all waters and their inability to grasp the reality of water issues in our state could be devastating to montanans
7096913 expand the reach of federal agencies to a virtually limitless level
7096914 direct assault on the rights of states and municipalities to manage our own water resources
7096915 decisions made locally would now potentially be subject to federal review
7096916 common sense practices might now require a permit from the federal government
7096917 montana may be required to adopt water quality standards to comply with this act and would need to develop a system to monitor and report on the quality of those waters
7096918 property owners are more likely to be sued and basic changes could be held up in court simply because all montana waters are now subject to federal review
7096919 preserving for states the ability to manage permitting grant and research programs
7096920 the secretary of the army or the administrator of the environmental protection agency
7096921 the term navigable waters means the waters of the united states including the territorial seas
7096922 montanans shouldnt have to fill out a bunch of federal forms for every single ditch creek and puddle on their property
7096923 while you may not believe this is the intent of the clean water restoration act of 2007 the harsh reality is that these new regulations will result in extensive litigation and increased compliance costs for folks who make their living off the land
7096924 passage of the clean water authority restoration act is the best way to ensure that all of the water resources in montana remain fully protected reaffirm congress original intent to eliminate pollution at its source and restore clarity and certainty to the law we and most other states rely upon to limit water pollution
7096925 this is about shifting the power back to the people
7096926 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7096927 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7096928 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7096929 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7096930 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7096931 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7096932 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7096933 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7096934 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7096935 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7096936 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7096937 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7096938 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7096939 in previous terrorist attacks for example the first attack against the world trade center we were able to arrest those responsible put them on trial
7096940 the individuals we hold at guantanamo are very very dangerous people
7096941 to give them full access to the federal courts and the criminal justice system is fraught with danger moving forward and likely to make america less safe unlike senator obamas claim of supporting the decision that it made america safer
7096942 i hate barack obama he wants to treat terrorists like criminals
7096943 i am confident i will get her votes if im the nominee its not clear she would get the votes i got if she were the nominee
7096944 active duty military personnel strengths by regional area and by country
7096945 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7096946 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
7096947 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
7096948 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
7096949 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7096950 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7096951 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7096952 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7096953 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7096954 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7096955 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7096956 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7096957 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7096958 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7096959 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7096960 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7096961 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7096962 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7096963 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7096964 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7096965 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7096966 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7096967 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7096968 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7096969 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7096970 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7096971 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7096972 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7096973 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7096974 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7096975 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7096976 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7096977 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7096978 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7096979 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7096980 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7096981 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7096982 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7096983 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7096984 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7096985 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7096986 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7096987 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7096988 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7096989 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7096990 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7096991 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7096992 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you

7096994 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7096995 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants

7097014 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7097015 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7097016 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7097017 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7097018 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7097019 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7097020 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7097021 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

7097024 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7097025 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7097026 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7097027 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7097028 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7097029 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7097030 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7097031 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

7097033 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7097034 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7097035 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7097036 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7097037 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7097038 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7097039 tax credits for anybody across america that demonstrates their ability to decrease consumption
7097040 we did it in the 70s we can do it again if we make conservation cool and we challenge the ingenuity of american scientists and consumers and marketers we can reduce our consumption by 1 billion barrels now we have a 3 billion barrel addiction
7097041 i think this country needs to regain our energy independence starting in the farm country where farmers produce their own fuels for their own communities and stop paying the freight both ways grain out oil back this and ive done the math could produce a billion barrels or about 17 of the total
7097042 we can grow it from 10 inches of precipitation all the way up to 40 from 2 000 feet of elevation all the way up to 6 500 75 day growing period and you can grow 50 to 125 gallons of diesel on every acre
7097043 the usda ought to be active in every community with guaranteed loans for farmers to build their own fuel plants
7097044 1 85 trillion cubic feet of associated dissolved natural gas and 148 million barrels of natural gas liquids in the bakken formation
7097045 the production process creates almost a ton of carbon dioxide for every barrel of liquid fuel
7097046 indicate that liquid coal would still release 4 to 8 percent more global warming than regular gasoline
7097047 researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology estimate it will cost 70 billion to build enough plants to replace 10 percent of american gasoline consumption
7097048 we can produce hundreds of thousands of engineering jobs in producing new technologies that we ship around the world
7097049 schweitzer responds that none of these facilities will be online for at least seven years and by then well have a federal carbon law that will give coal companies the incentives they need to get it done
7097050 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7097051 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7097052 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7097053 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7097054 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

7097059 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7097060 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7097061 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified

7097077 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7097078 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners

7097179 everyone asks who runs linux to which the normal answer is either linus torvalds or the community but as master yoda once said there is another
7097180 last year desktop linux failed but this year is the year of linux on the desktop really 111
7097181 this was a match rich with emotion and very captivating we wanted to win but we merited at least a point because we played with 10 men for more than an hour well take three points against berlin next week
7097182 depois de ouvirmos as explica es de ambos decidimos n o tomar nenhuma a o
7097183 eu n o pude acreditar fui fechado por glock e na hora lembrei que aconteceu o mesmo comigo em budapeste
7097184 es gibt viel zu tun der eine oder andere spieler wird noch zu uns kommen
7097185 nicht ber die qualit t verf gt die wir uns w nschen der kader muss in der breite vern nftig aufgestellt sein
7097186 por um lado foi ruim porque n o consegui aproveitar um problema com o pantano por outro foi bom j que em condi es normais ele ampliaria a vantagem na classifica o em mais quatro pontos
7097187 na verdade acho que s d para lamentar a perda da oitava posi o por muito pouco com o sistema de grid invertido da categoria eu largaria na pole amanh e teria uma enorme chance de grudar nele no campeonato
7097188 sa mos com 115 litros de gasolina ou seja com combust vel at a boca e o consumo costuma ser cr tico na maioria dos circuitos sempre terminamos a corrida com o tanque quase vazio
7097189 o que complicou aqui que a volta de sa da dos boxes para alinhamento no grid muito longa muito maior que nas outras pistas
7097190 hoje por exemplo ganhei tr s posi es na primeira volta e depois preferi ficar na minha o carro est bom com algumas pequenas mudan as no acerto acho que vai dar para terminar bem
7097191 os comiss rios depois de ouvirem as explica es de ambos os pilotos decidiram que o incidente n o precisava de nenhuma outra a o

7097194 le nigeria produit presque 45 des missions de ges dafrique cause du gaz br l dans les torch res des gisements p troliers du delta du niger tandis que lafrique du sud en produit la m me quantit cause de sa pollution industrielle
7097195 le nigeria met 20 milliards de m3 de gaz de torch res chaque ann e soit 13 des 150 milliards de m3 mis dans le monde ce qui fait de ce pays le second plus gros metteur au monde derri re la russie
7097196 les missions du nigeria et dafrique du sud aussi importantes quelles en aient lair ne sont en aucun cas comparables aux missions des pays industrialis s
7097197 cest pour cette raison que lafrique du sud insiste pour que les pays d velopp s montrent lexemple en mati re de r duction de ges avant que les pays en voie de d veloppement ne r duisent leurs propres missions
7097198 ce nest pas normal que le nigeria et lafrique du sud par exemple r duisent leurs missions alors que les pays industrialis s qui sont en grande partie responsables du changement climatique ne fassent aucun effort pour r duire les leurs
7097199 it was kind of like a normal monday of game week we followed up on our western michigan prep from yesterday we still have a lot of work to do still have a long way to go but the attitude has been good and the commitment has been good
7097200 chelsea fc have agreed terms for andriy shevchenko to return to ac milan
7097201 details of the agreement will remain confidential the move is subject to a successful medical
7097202 after a series of frantic phone calls during the day today we have reached an agreement with chelsea
7097203 president silvio berlusconi and i am happy as is our coach and i believe also our players i believe that milan are the only club in the world to have three european players of the year in our squad
7097204 andriy has returned home and i am happy about it i am a milan fan and i am very happy ive spoken to andriy 48 times in the past three hours the terms of the agreement are very private
7097205 between today and tomorrow andriy will be at milan and he will start again his life as a milan player andriy made a mistake in leaving and i believe that in the past two years he has realised that this is his home
7097206 eu praticamente n o tinha freio provavelmente aconteceu um vazamento de leo do sistema de freio o curso do pedal ficou muito longo e isso me atrapalhou bastante na briga por posi es a partir da quinta volta
7097207 de resto o carro estava bom e ter amos um resultado bem interessante caso o freio estivesse normal
7097208 fiquei feliz com a vit ria do petrov pois al m de ser meu parceiro de equipe ele mostrou que temos carro para brigar pelo p dio na prova deste domingo
7097209 se tiver outro bom resultado amanh vou avan ar mais na pontua o e talvez possa amea ar os ponteiros at o final da temporada
7097210 were struggling to find a place where she can be kept under lock and key
7097211 we have to wait and see what the judge decides
7097212 im not ready to take that kind of money out of the county coffers if there are other options
7097213 i think she has shown from the day of her initial arrest to the day of her indictment that shes not a flight risk
7097214 you could turn a gym into a courtroom if you needed to
7097215 clients perceptions of how reorientation therapy and self help can promote changes in sexual orientation
7097216 receive a return text with a link to a mobile compatible website where they can select to view a dvd sneak peek from the latest season dvds of two of televisions most watched properties
7097217 allowing consumers to sample these great dvd extras while shopping adds to the retail experience and will we believe positively impact buying decisions
7097218 no one is giving us respect and we like that
7097219 were still the quiet team lurking thats a perfect sign for me just the way we have attacked this camp were not anywhere settled with our super bowl win
7097220 my saying is if you got 10 fingers why not fill all of them
7097221 im not satisfied with one big ring i want a few
7097222 are you satisfied you won a super bowl if anybodys satisfied youre crazy i dont think as players any of us are satisfied with our contracts how we played anything about us when you get satisfied thats complacency and in this league those guys go so fast
7097223 during the regular season we didnt feel we were the best team
7097224 when we got to the playoffs we got some confidence we played better football than anyone else and we kept that great confidence going we still think we can play better no one is giving us much credit and that adds to the fire and makes us say lets go earn it
7097225 a lot of people didnt think we could do it last year and there are a lot of people that dont think we can do it again
7097226 certainly tom has told us the next step is to go out and put it behind us we have the ring to remind ourselves how great of a season it was when you go through that type of season it makes you believe that you can do it again
7097227 every time ive been on a team that has won there has been a sense of urgency and i feel the sense of urgency here when ive been on a team that thinks were really good we end up doing really bad i think every team that has been successful has had something to prove and we do
7097228 beckett first reported numbness and tingling in his right hand after sleeping on his arm the night before his latest start aug 17 when he gave up eight runs and eight hits in 2 1 3 innings in a 15 4 loss to toronto hes now sleeping with a special sleeve to prevent a recurrence of the problem

7097230 jaaa en nou geen ik eens lekker me kamer van voren tot achter uit mesten
7097231 i need a new wallet and would enjoy the other
7097232 it was good for our fans to get to see this team play we wanted the freshmen to get their feet wet it was a very good crowd for them to play in front of
7097233 it was great to see so many kids here this morning
7097234 its great to see everyone come out and it shows the support weve gotten in the last few years we appreciated all of them being here were hoping theyll continue to come out
7097235 sie sind im kommen und gegen so viel ps kommen wir nicht an
7097236 der red bull ist eines der schnellsten autos aber toro rosso hat den ferrari motor also haben sie vielleicht einen vorteil
7097237 sie haben an diesem wochenende noch keinen guten lauf gehabt wir hingegen schon das kann n chstes wochenende schon wieder anders aussehen
7097238 was wir hier gesehen haben ist dass einige teams auf einer neuen strecke in die richtige richtung gearbeitet haben und andere nicht
7097239 das team hat einen guten job gemacht und mir ein auto gegeben das heute eines der besten war
7097240 ich musste vom gas weil neben mir ein fahrer war
7097241 das war ein gutes rennen leider habe ich beim boxenstopp ein paar pl tze verloren und musste danach attackieren
7097242 erst habe ich ein paar runden geschaut wo ich den angriff setzen soll dann bin ich auch gleich vorbeigekommen leider konnte er aber nochmal kontern
7097243 ich habe bremsprobleme bekommen und so bekam maldonado eine chance
7097244 i have received reports of five deaths however i have to re check before confirming the death of laxmanananda saraswati
7097245 i spoke to the union home secretary to rush additional forces and allow extension of the stay of seven companies of crpf which had been deployed in the district since december 2007 when communal violence had broken out there
7097246 if some big leader or a filmstar had gone missing would they have searched it the same way
7097247 every day brings in some hope and ends in despair the only way left for me is to go the home ministers house along with my children and immolate myself
7097248 i wouldnt have run that piece there was nothing in it
7097249 it was filled with innuendo when youre done reading it youre like theres no there there
7097250 just a bunch of female readers gobbling up that shit
7097251 i bear witness that there is no god but obama and that biden is his servant
7097252 there is much to analyse and improve we have to raise the bar before our first world cup qualifier against israel on 6 september to achieve a good result there but i have a great team that will improve considerably once everyone has hit their best form
7097253 pollution affects all of us but those who suffer from asthma are more sensitive and experience the effects more quickly and severely
7097254 there is a heavy government involvement in tourism development but governments are not designed to be innovative governments are designed to follow rules
7097255 if everyone else would get their acts together tourism would improve
7097256 there is nothing wrong with our bahamian biology there is something wrong with our sociology
7097257 but with tourism it is not so clear that rapid development really is in the locals economic interest if their government trashes their natural habitat it is like an investment manager who pays you big dividends out of your capital the money is good for a while but you lose in the long term
7097258 if you destroy your heritage and scenery you will come to regret it
7097259 do unto others as you would have them do unto you
7097260 the bahamas handbook records that in may 1965 richard joseph travel editor of esquire informed the us house ways and means committee that while the us spent 3
7097261 when only one nuclear bomb could destroy a city like minneapolis we dont need 6 000
7097262 senator mccain its time to get serious about reducing the nuclear threat
7097263 barack obama could not have picked a stronger candidate as his running mate
7097264 senator biden has had a distinguished career fighting for american families at home and exhibiting strong leadership on issues abroad the obama biden ticket is an exciting ticket that will win in november
7097265 the most strident hillary supporters appear to be upset this morning
7097266 we hear about climate change as a political issue an environmental issue and an economic issue we want to press the point that this is a moral issue
7097267 the crops die farmers then have to plough and plant again
7097268 it is not moral for some people to go to bed with a full stomach when others go to bed with their stomach empty
7097269 rivers are drying out where we get water and fish
7097270 the walk to collect water is increasing as wells dry up
7097271 it is very easy to forget the human dimension there are people today whose lives are being disrupted by climate change
7097272 this is a moral issue in the sense that rising emissions in rich countries should not lead to rising poverty in others
7097273 the bacteria in the gut lumen are genetically identical but some of them are prepared to sacrifice themselves for the greater good you could compare this act to kamikaze fighter pilots of the japanese army
7097274 we still live in the country that was built by ivan the terrible
7097275 people like putin they have no other idea of how to rule
7097276 what russia does now it cannot be analyzed with modern political logic it is obsolete if modern countries like the u s declare war they have more or less rational reasons even if they are mistaken
7097277 you shouldnt expect logic from a kgb lieutenant colonel anyway you shouldnt expect modern political thinking
7097278 russia is a big and capable country which will not let the west dictate the conditions
7097279 in any situation russia is going to act as it sees fit
7097280 russia has never been conquered not in 1 000 years though many tried
7097281 its because its in our genes not to allow anyone to dictate the conditions how to act where to act
7097282 theyve realized that if russia merely plays the role the west has made for it we would quickly become a country that protects the pipeline sending gas and oil from western siberia
7097283 it is too early to bury russia as a great power
7097284 what makes the situation even more difficult is that all these small nations which existed between russia and the heart of europe they have rushed to join europe
7097285 maar gewonnen is er nog niets henrik stenson is een van de beste golfers ter wereld pas na de 72e hole zijn we zeker over de uitslag

7097293 the fact that he didnt says a lot its important for my boys to see a love relationship that doesnt depend on skin types they see they dont have to be with a light skinned black woman to be successful
7097294 i wouldnt give a damn about him if it wasnt for michelle
7097295 he has enough fortitude and courage to let michelle be michelle
7097296 its important for my boys to see a love relationship that doesnt depend on skin types they see they dont have to be with a light skinned black woman to be successful

7097317 the further away you get from doing something like idol if youre not right back out there with a single or an acting opportunity people tend to forget
7097318 i think i had a different vision a vision for myself
7097319 but if we could capture the chicken little that i saw on american idol i felt like wed be in good shape
7097320 i dont think kevin realized going into it how physical the role would be
7097321 ive already told fans who have asked about the movie if youre as young as i think you are you should probably wait about five to seven years to see it
7097322 there were people who worked on labor pains who had previously worked with her on other projects
7097323 but i heard from those same people that there was a drastic improvement and she was doing really well i can tell you for a fact that every day i was on set and working she was there on time and she delivered really admirably
7097324 it was what id do as a kid id turn the volume down and start calling the game myself
7097325 whether its the super bowl or the world series i want to be the first guy who gets to sing the national anthem and then go upstairs and call the game
7097326 that reminds me of a story so dirty im ashamed to think of it myself
7097327 in selecting sen joe biden as his running mate sen obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of
7097328 sen bidens record in the united states senate is one of support and understanding that has been unwavering throughout his career
7097329 we only need to look back to the recent passage of the repeal of the hiv travel and immigration ban to see the type of leadership we can expect from sen biden on the issues important to our community
7097330 it was because of his determination and tenacity that we were able to see this relic of discrimination against people living with hiv aids torn down
7097331 if the support sen biden has proven on our issues is any indication of the type of vice president he will be than our community can be assured that sen obama has chosen a thoughtful and staunch advocate for equality as his closest adviser
7097332 i dont know biden was selected primarily for his electoral strengths
7097333 my guess is he wont add much to obamas candidacy in midwestern states
7097334 this underlines the fact sen obama lacks judgment in foreign policy
7097335 i know there are activities out there but im too lazy to find them can you do it for me

7097337 sparked a nationwide controversy over whether catholics who support legal abortion can receive communion
7097338 selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7097339 the american bishops have instructed catholic voters to consider many issues but have characterized the defense of human life as foundational and have explained that the issue has a special claim on the conscience of the catholic voter this means that a political candidate like biden because of his strong support for abortion rights forfeits any claim for support despite his views on other issues like health care and the economy
7097340 this looks like something that could roll out nationally if the ticket takes it all the way

7097378 degree to which an individual values each of these desires and reveals his or her enduring life goals psychological needs and personality traits

7097399 had there been party leaders who had a major role in choosing the nominee this year it is probably much more likely it would have been a hillary clinton rather than a young barack obama
7097400 i think people figured if these guys cant run a convention without battling each other in the street and on the floor of the convention hall how the hell can they run the country
7097401 as representatives and senators saw the way students were taking to the streets they thought wed be better off if we channeled this into regular participation and not street politics

7097403 they came here to agitate and they did a fantastic job

7097413 the rules are every time obama says the word change you take a shot and every time he says the word hope you take a double shot
7097414 informed by the seemingly abstract notions of multiplicities flows arrangements and connections the analysis of the relationship of desire to reality and to the capitalist machine yields answers to concrete questions
7097415 putting an end to the process or prolonging it indefinitely which strictly speaking is tantamount to ending it abruptly and prematurely is what creates the artificial schizophrenic found in mental institutions a limp rag forced into autistic behavior produced as an entirely separate and independent entity
7097416 the body without organs the unproductive the unconsumable serves as a surface for the recording of the entire process of production of desire so that desiring machines seem to emanate from it in the apparent objective movement that establishes a relationship between the machines and the body without organs
7097417 this subject itself is not at the center which is occupied by the machine but on the periphery with no fixed identity forever decentered defined by the states through which it passes
7097418 there are those who will maintain that the schizo is incapable of uttering the word i and that we must restore his ability to pronounce this hallowed word
7097419 desire does not lack anything it does not lack its object it is rather the subject that is missing in desire or desire that lacks a fixed subject there is no fixed subject unless there is repression

7097452 aau members must have a minimum of 12 years of continuous membership serving above and beyond time and energy donated to youth sports and have special achievements

7097464 sparked a nationwide controversy over whether catholics who support legal abortion can receive communion
7097465 selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7097466 the american bishops have instructed catholic voters to consider many issues but have characterized the defense of human life as foundational and have explained that the issue has a special claim on the conscience of the catholic voter this means that a political candidate like biden because of his strong support for abortion rights forfeits any claim for support despite his views on other issues like health care and the economy

7097471 when i was a baby we didnt have internet or cds
7097472 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
7097473 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
7097474 and as recently as yesterday i think it is our pastor from saddleback rick warren indicated that he would not feel comfortable voting for an adulterer and i dont know exactly to whom he was referring but i think the data speaks for itself and again at the end of the day and i really appreciate you raising this because at the end of the day again i think the american public deserves full revelation of the candidates character and competency character and competency so whatever questions that should be asked that would give the voting public an indication as to who they are and what theyve done should be fair game
7097475 absolutely i would absolutely i would because if you cant keep your faith to your most sacred vow til death do us part how in the world can i trust you to lead my family my government my nation absolutely i would i think people first need to ask forgiveness and then earn trust back over time can trust be re earned absolutely but it takes time

7097512 the first thing that i would do is call in john kerry bob kerrey
7097513 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7097514 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7097515 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions

7097614 it can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police
7097615 power is inherent in the people it is their right and duty to be at all times armed
7097616 those who give up essential liberties to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
7097617 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7097618 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president

7097624 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7097625 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7097626 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7097627 the united states will strive to complete the agreement before the end of 2008
7097628 if it is a sin for the poor to steal from the rich it must be a much bigger sin for the rich to steal from the poor

7097633 ik kan het bijna niet geloven wat een prestatie ik ga gelijk bij sjaen kei veel bier drinken
7097634 prachtig dat ik na die 3 weken op plek 2 heb kunnen eindigen en zeker ook omdat ik het zonder prestatiebevorderende middelen heb kunnen doen daar waar andere personen uit de top van het klassement nogal eens onder verdacht stonden ik ben dan ook een zeer grote fan van cadel evans en zie uit naar 2008
7097635 schitterend dat ik deze toto heb kunnen winnen al staat mijn seizoen vooral in het teken van de klassiekertoto de klassiekertoto is voor mij toch net iets belangrijker en prestigeuser maar de blijdschap en tevredenheid overheerst ik ga dit resultaat dan ook luidruchtig vieren
7097636 it would be strange law that a person would not have a first amendment right to use information that is available to everyone
7097637 i expect you to have that memorized by next summer
7097638 fortunately you have your own personal copy of the constitution and a dad that can and will help you with it

7097640 hey dad we won our game and im the only one that scored
7097641 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
7097642 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
7097643 the two of us had plans for what we were going to do but you could say our whole lives stopped
7097644 and believe me when you see someone dying of aids its really bad its different each time no one dies the same way
7097645 this aids study was it seems the beginning of many years of research being carried out on me without my knowledge or consent
7097646 if as the ethics application form states consent was obtained from all subjects how is it that i did not know about my aids status until 1987
7097647 i did not know anything about his studies or research
7097648 i believe nonconsensual research was conducted by doctors of hemophilia in this country
7097649 frustration a sense of being repeatedly betrayed there are lessons to be learned that havent been learned yet

7097657 these people have faced enormous financial and emotional hardships from this catastrophe and they deserve to know what happened and why and to be sure it will never happen again
7097658 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
7097659 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
7097660 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
7097661 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
7097662 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
7097663 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
7097664 its like sitting on your back porch and driving your house
7097665 their projected rates of expansion are so fast that we dont have a hope in hell of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
7097666 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7097667 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7097668 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7097669 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7097670 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7097671 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7097672 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7097673 this evenings recorded arts concert brings together sound art spoken word and field recordings from around the world for the sole purpose of listening
7097674 seventy six civilians most of them women and children were martyred today in a coalition forces operation in herat province
7097675 insurgents engaged the soldiers from multiple points within the compound using small arms and rpg rocket propelled grenade fire
7097676 the joint forces responded with small arms fire and an air strike killing 30 militants
7097677 more than 30 people have been killed i cannot say how many of them are civilians
7097678 twenty five taliban were killed including sidiq and one other commander
7097679 we need to preach the gospel and stand united we need to ask our protestant brothers and sisters to walk with us
7097680 obviously it got out of control but to be honest i thought i was in a safe house
7097681 i thought i was part of a community that handled its problems internally and that recognized the dangers of exposing ourselves no pun intended to the rest of the country
7097682 hi mrs esposito this is moonflower from the dnc event coordinators office your
7097683 non si e trattato di una spedizione punitiva contro una persona di colore a opera di gruppi di estrema destra o appartenenti a qualunque formazione politica

7097685 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato

7097689 we know that during the afternoon ahmed and a group of friends were on the top floor of the block of flats
7097690 they saw the group of six youths approach the estate on bikes at that point they decided to leave ahmed had become separated from his friends who went to the third floor
7097691 ahmed remained at the top and it seems that one or more of the group made their way up to ahmed and he has been so scared he has made his way out of the balcony to shin down the outside of the flat
7097692 when he got to the seventh floor his progress was stopped by a grille
7097693 he has cried out for help lost his grip and fallen to his death
7097694 ahmed was a very much loved son grandson brother and nephew his loss is an enormous tragedy for his loving and devoted family
7097695 he was a happy friendly and generous boy who stayed away from trouble and was a good student
7097696 on the day of his untimely death he was due to receive his gcse results he would have been delighted to discover that his hard work and dedication to his studies had rewarded him with passes in maths and science as well as other subjects
7097697 his 17th birthday would have been on september 1 and this was the day he was due to enrol on a mechanical engineering course at tower hamlets college
7097698 weve got to play the perfect game and theyve got to miss more than usual
7097699 the governor has indicated that obama did not select him as a running mate
7097700 senator obama has made an outstanding selection in joe biden
7097701 strong leader fierce advocate and devoted family man with values rooted in the best of what american stands for
7097702 joe biden has been fighting his entire career for the change that senator obama champions
7097703 a sage voice on many of the toughest foreign policy issues of our time and has long been a strong advocate for protecting american families and making our communities safer
7097704 in naming my colleague and friend senator joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7097705 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7097706 i just think were not getting into the details of the tick tock
7097707 he made a set of compromises all in a row that freaked people out on the progressive side of the party
7097708 is a narrative about his life that ties his life to his positions
7097709 i never thought i would see this in my lifetime
7097710 its one of the ways to give her recognition as the first woman to come this far in presidential politics
7097711 im not sure she always understands it but i tell her she would have loved this moment
7097712 the sooner we do that the better off well be
7097713 by and large the american people are ready for a democratic president fruits4obama 08 22 2008 2 57 p m et
7097714 theyre not saying anything to the pilots but weve been told to be on standby tomorrow today
7097715 this person is best qualified to serve as president should anything happen to the president
7097716 i dont like choosing a president on their electability their ability to win the presidency
7097717 in any hierarchy each person tends to rise to his her level of incompetency
7097718 and biden led the charge in stopping robert borks nomination for the supreme court
7097719 is there any record anywhere of obama facilitating bipartisan solutions in illinois in the us senate
7097720 we had the one day friday where it kind of came back thats why we decided to do what we did it has gotten better the treatment and stuff is definitely working
7097721 so were dealing with that too the doctors say its going to help so were going with it
7097722 i think that was part of the problem yesterday having that whole day off and not doing any treatments
7097723 rakyat sepatutnya menikmati harga minyak yang lebih rendah kerana malaysia negara pengeluar minyak kita tidak sama dengan singapura dan thailand yang tidak mempunyai minyak
7097724 kerajaan yang banyak aset berharga hanya menurunkan rm0 15 sen sahaja ini bermakna malaysia was was membantu rakyat tidak macam kita sanggup membela keseluruhan rakyat tanpa kira kaum
7097725 mungkin itu antara petunjuk jalan mempercepatkan pertukaran kerajaan ramai akan melompat ikut pakatan rakyat bila semuanya tenang
7097726 tidak dinafikan ada parti di sabah yang gentar bila sebut tentang pemerintahan baru bagi mereka ia sesuatu yang baru dan sukar dilakukan
7097727 oh my god i cannot give up my home what were they thinking
7097728 los pesimistas usualmente tienen la raz n los optimistas usualmente est n equivocados pero la mayor a de los grandes cambios fueron hechos por los optimistas
7097729 i should have run in 96 and i should have run in 2000
7097730 biden and dodd who would have been giants in the 1992 field are asterisks in 2007
7097731 iowa is the last place where you have a chance without tens of millions of dollars
7097732 you deserve to be the first in the nation because you take it seriously
7097733 i was one of those people who saw potential in both candidates
7097734 i went to biden events and remember sitting with him and discussing farm issues he has very strong opinions on many things
7097735 delaware can get another senator but my boys only have one dad
7097736 hes very good in this now rare setting mass audience oratory
7097737 rising to a shout lowering to a whisper 100 years ago he might have worked the chautauqua circuit with william jennings bryan
7097738 a lot of minnesotans remember those great times and want those great times to return badly
7097739 i think this stadium is going to allow minnesotans to rally around football being back on campus and allow us to reconnect with that great tradition and history of gophers football
7097740 the flags would be flying the fraternities would be out people cheering saturday was a special day
7097741 i think something is missing and i think its missing more today than it was when they moved to the dome
7097742 all the things that now surround college football have made it far more of an event than a game we have not had the event weve still had the game but we have not had the event
7097743 we were a whole lot closer to the bottom than we were to the top
7097744 the additional revenue means i think that were going to keep viable at least in the immediate future a 25 sport athletic program
7097745 its a critical link between the stadium and the academic interests
7097746 its a heartstring appeal sometimes people come back and its about the memories and the great times they had at the u
7097747 weve got to put a football team on the field that can win
7097748 heck you put a team out there thats not going to win it doesnt matter what stadium youre in right
7097749 i was all in favor of going into the dome
7097750 how it turned out winning is of course everything to it
7097751 i dont believe anybody is going to buy tickets for very long to see the facility
7097752 you can walk through the facility and see it for nothing
7097753 when recruits come to games now at the metrodome we are at a competitive disadvantage
7097754 right now kids can go to other places in the big ten and across the country and have a better game day experience than theyre going to have at minnesota
7097755 we never had a chance to show recruits where they are going to play
7097756 it was always set up for something else like a snowmobile race or monster truck show it looked nothing like football
7097757 this is our locker room we decorate it nobody else is in here this is our house our home you cant do that when youre sharing with so many other people
7097758 it was obviously a special thing because it happened 30 years ago and im still telling the story
7097759 the theme of our convention is americans coming together for change
7097760 its a celebration of the people of this country and what they can achieve when we all work together each of our convention officers has dedicated their lives to helping strengthen their community and strengthen our country we are excited to have them join with our permanent chair speaker pelosi co chairs governor sebelius mayor franklin and state senator van de putte and dnc chairman dean to oversee the 2008 convention they share barack obamas positive vision for change and will be important messengers for the campaign moving forward
7097761 solitude trying to stay in control of things always trying to do right
7097762 thats how theyre able to become what they feel inside
7097763 thats who simba is so i encourage him if thats what he wants to do to act out his lion persona
7097764 but some of the guests do kind of look at them like what in the world
7097765 but with star trek theres one thing to relate it to
7097766 if youre a fur theres no one thing to relate it to people cant make sense of it
7097767 a lot of the misunderstanding comes from career minded adults asking why are people this age doing this
7097768 these are the only friends we had when we were growing up
7097769 some people crack open a beer some people sit in front of the tv
7097770 my other half happens to be a furry and our outlook on it is pretty much the same
7097771 you can call it a lifestyle its part of who we are it gives us an escape from the daily bs and rigmarole
7097772 coming up i had a hard life lions were always strong and dominant they helped me get through a lot of troubles just kept me strong
7097773 its basically how much flak are you willing to take
7097774 they think theres a very large sex thing going on and theres not
7097775 it would be a lie to say theres not an adult aspect to it
7097776 but its not a religion or an occult group theres no idols to worship we leave religion out of it completely
7097777 how do i reconcile being a furry and a christian its pretty difficult
7097778 i dont hide it that im a furry within my church and im more involved with my ministry than i am as a furry
7097779 its one of the few times you can say you have a family thats 100 percent accepting of who you are
7097780 you can feel free to be yourself without fear of being persecuted by other people
7097781 were not obsessed to the point where we dont function outside of it
7097782 it just makes you feel like the animal for a short time
7097783 the explanations are exceptionally well done the music is spectacular and the camera work is some of the best ive ever seen on a magic video

7097929 one of obamas strongest distinctions from mccain was his wisdom and courage in opposing the invasion of iraq by choosing biden however who was as big a backer of the war as the republican nominee obama is now saying that this doesnt really matter thereby negating one of his biggest advantages bidens experience is that of a militarist whose contempt for international law has been apparent in hard line positions on iraq and other critical foreign policy issues
7097930 this isnt american democracy in action its the failure of american democracy before we go to war with iraq we must be able to determine that iraq poses a threat to the national security of the united states such a determination must be backed up with substantive fact i believe that iraq does not pose a threat to the u s worthy of war this conclusion is shared by many senior military officers according to president bush and his advisers iraq is known to possess weapons of mass destruction and is actively seeking to reconstitute the weapons production capabilities i bear personal witness through seven years as a chief weapons inspector in iraq for the un to both the scope of iraqs weapons of mass destruction programs and the effectiveness of the un weapons inspectors in ultimately eliminating them while we were never able to provide 100 percent certainty regarding the disposition of iraqs proscribed weaponry we did ascertain a 90 95 percent level of verified disarmament these are the sort of facts that must be included in any hearing that seeks to determine the threat posed by iraq today it is clear that sen biden and his colleagues have no interest in such facts
7097931 i do not believe this is a rush to war i believe it is a march to peace and security i believe that failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur saddam hussein possesses chemical and biological weapons and is seeking nuclear weapons
7097932 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after i am absolutely confident the president will not take us to war alone
7097933 the only way the only way were going to get rid of saddam hussein is were going to end up having to start it alone start it alone and its going to require guys like you ritter in uniform to be back on foot in the desert taking this son of a the taking saddam down

7098040 flee from sexual immorality all other sins a man commits are outside his body but he who sins sexually sins against his own body
7098041 first of all masturbation will not truly relieve the sexual pressure that one may feel it may for a short moment but in the long run it only creates a deeper desire and capacity for sex which will lead to more masturbation if you let yourself become enslaved to a sexual high you will find that you need to go to increasingly extreme acts to maintain the same degree of excitement the more he indulges in his dependency the more ensnared by addiction he becomes this is the nature of all sin that is why jesus declared that all who sin become a slave to sin john 8 34
7098042 13 do not continue offering or yielding your bodily members and faculties to sin as instruments tools of wickedness but offer and yield yourselves to god as though you have been raised from the dead to perpetual life and your bodily members and faculties to god presenting them as implements of righteousness 19 i am speaking in familiar human terms because of your natural limitations for as you yielded your bodily members and faculties as servants to impurity and ever increasing lawlessness so now yield your bodily members and faculties once for all as servants to righteousness right being and doing which leads to sanctification

7098049 in the same way count yourselves dead to sin but alive to god in christ jesus therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires do not offer the parts of your body to sin as instruments of wickedness but rather offer yourselves to god as those who have been brought from death to life and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness for sin shall not be your master for you are not under law but under grace
7098050 for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need

7098171 you cant shoot less than 40 percent and expect to win gold medals
7098172 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7098173 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic yeah
7098174 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7098175 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off
7098176 even william hartnell who played the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines i think hell always probably tend to be around 40
7098177 as long as it was great and fantastic then yeah but a film is on for 90 minutes and that is not as important as the series but as long as it doesnt get in the way of the show we could do it
7098178 i would not rule out a film version of doctor who no
7098179 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7098180 shut up just shut up it is easy to find out whats going on with the show we virtually publish the scripts and we film in public
7098181 but in giving things away you become that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7098182 the show is really tough for a superfit david tennant so you might kill somebody who takes on the role in their 60s for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7098183 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40

7098386 the us money supply has experienced the sharpest contraction in modern history heightening the risk of a wall street crunch and a severe economic slowdown in coming months data compiled by lombard street research shows that the m3 broad money
7098387 monthly data for july show that the broad money growth has almost collapsed

7098390 over time inflation will be the last problem that the fed will have to face as a severe us recession and global slowdown will lead to a sharp reduction in inflationary pressures in the u s slack in goods markets with demand falling below supply will reduce pricing power of firms slack in labor markets with unemployment rising will reduce wage pressures and labor costs pressures a fall in commodity prices of the order of 30 will further reduce inflationary pressure the fed will have to cut the fed funds rate much more as severe downside risks to growth and to financial stability will dominate any short term upward inflationary pressures leaving aside the risk of a collapse of the us dollar given this easier monetary policy the fed funds rate may end up being closer to 0 than 1 by the end of this financial crisis and severe recession cycle
7098391 recent government statistics show that only between 10 and 20 of the rebate dollars were spent the rebates added nearly 80 billion to the permanent national debt but less than 20 billion to consumer spending here are the facts tax rebates of 78 billion arrived in the second quarter of the year the governments recent gdp figures show that the level of consumer outlays only rose by an extra 12 billion or 15 of the lost revenue the rest went into savings including the paydown of debt consumer outlays increased to 36 billion from 24 billion so the additional 12 billion of consumer spending was less than 16 of the extra 76 billion of disposable personal income by comparison savings rose by 62 billion or five times as much this experience confirms earlier studies showing that one time tax rebates are not a cost effective way to increase economic activity
7098392 the recent plunge in m3 ed m3 is the broadest measure of money used by economists to estimate the entire supply of money makes it likely that credit lines have been fully tapped and or banks have simply turned off the spigot liquidity shrinks by the day banks scrambling to refinance long term debt are going to have a very tough go of it weekly unemployment claims are soaring consumers out of a job are going to have a tough time paying bills those looking for a bottom in these conditions are simply barking up the wrong tree
7098393 the problem began in the roaring twenties when the fed made money plentiful by keeping interest rates low money seemed to be plentiful but what was actually flowing freely was credit or debt production was up more than wages so more goods were available than money to pay for them but people could borrow money was so easy to get that people were borrowing just to invest taking out short term low interest loans that were readily available from the banks
7098394 the fed began selling securities in the open market reducing the money supply by reducing the reserves available for backing loans the result was a huge liquidity squeeze a lack of available money short term loans suddenly became available only at much higher interest rates making buying stock on margin much less attractive as fewer people bought stock prices fell removing the incentive for new buyers to purchase stocks bought by earlier buyers on margin the stock market crashed overnight
7098395 the federal reserve definitely caused the great depression by contracting the amount of currency in circulation by one third from 1929 to 1933

7098449 but i was going to blog about it this morning

7098451 watch your back rachel kat and darnell are the ones to watch
7098452 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7098453 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7098454 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7098455 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7098456 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7098457 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7098458 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7098459 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7098460 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7098461 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7098462 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7098463 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7098464 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7098465 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7098466 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7098467 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7098468 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7098469 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7098470 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7098471 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7098472 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7098473 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7098474 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7098475 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7098476 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7098477 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7098478 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7098479 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7098480 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7098481 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7098482 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7098483 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7098484 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7098485 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7098486 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7098487 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7098488 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7098489 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7098490 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7098491 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7098492 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7098493 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7098494 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7098495 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7098496 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7098497 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7098498 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7098499 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7098500 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7098501 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7098502 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7098503 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7098504 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7098505 who are open to doing something on the production side
7098506 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7098507 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7098508 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7098509 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7098510 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7098511 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7098512 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7098513 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7098514 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7098515 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7098516 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7098517 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7098518 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7098519 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7098520 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7098521 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7098522 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7098523 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7098524 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7098525 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7098526 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7098527 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7098528 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7098529 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7098530 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7098531 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7098532 we call ourselves the worlds biggest democracy but we are allowing these extremist groups to dictate what can be allowed in the public sphere
7098533 every single time they called or i called libya they told me of someone who just died or who is dying the cause of death is either a car accident or cancer

7098536 long stretch of desolate land located in the middle of the sahara desert has been a zone of contention among the colonial powers of africa and between the now independent and sovereign countries of chad and libya
7098537 it remained in libyan hands until a chadian offensive in the late 1980s in 1990 the two countries finally agreed to take their dispute to the international court of justice which ruled in early 1994 that the aozou strip belonged to chad
7098538 why would two countries engage in hostilities over a stretch of desert according to rumors the aozou strip contains rich deposits of uranium

7098542 we made a conscious decision at the command headquarters to deliberately and willfully blow up chemical stockpiles along with the biological stockpiles along with the nuclear reactors that iraq possessed we knew where they were we knew what he saddam had this is in schwarzkopfs autobiography on page 390 and all the chemicals and biological stuff came back on the u s troops and everybody in the region
7098543 any time you move a city or an army or you blow up an infrastructure you release toxic industrial chemicals from everything that you can think of in a city a community and in an industry
7098544 dust from the sahara desert can be transported over thousands of kilometres by convection currents which also cause other meteorological conditions such as thunderstorms because the sahara where sandstorms are very common is a major source of mineral dust large concentrations of the dust can be found in the tropical atlantic and the caribbean

7098567 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7098568 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7098569 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7098570 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7098571 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7098572 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7098573 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7098574 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7098575 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7098576 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7098577 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7098578 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7098579 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7098580 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7098581 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7098582 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7098583 i cant remember where i was when i heard but it was really exciting
7098584 i knew we were getting close but not as close as that it was brilliant news its very rewarding to know that all the hard work and sleepless nights pay off when something like that happens you realise thats why youre doing it thats why im getting up at three in the morning
7098585 i was informed earlier on today that i have now sold 1 million albums and counting of course
7098586 im not writing any songs right now i dont have the time i dont have the energy
7098587 the things that inspire me are everyday life and when youre doing what im doing you dont have an everyday life people can say oh but you travel the world but in reality i see absolutely nothing im going to norway on monday and ill see the airport and a hotel and thats it and when you do this day in day out when you have little sleep it doesnt inspire you
7098588 i know that i need to go home and have a normal life because thats what inspires me to write songs
7098589 theyre not proper fans theyre just there for the hell of it to start something
7098590 and thats just such a blight on our country it makes us look like absolute idiots like we could start a fight in an empty room that part of it really annoyed me i look at it and think its absolutely pathetic how anybody could go somewhere and react like that
7098591 im happier than ive ever been i dont really feel the need to talk to the press about things like this as its my private life and id like to keep it that way but thanks to everyone for their lovely messages
7098592 it was just one of those things i didnt expect it but it was lovely and were both really really happy
7098593 im not the kind of person that im talking about
7098594 im talking about your jade goodys who goes on big brother and is now a massive star and your coleen mcloughlins that are now incredibly famous because of who theyre with that isnt me at all so i still totally stand by everything i said it might seem a bit strange because im going to be married to a footballer but i still do my own thing and ive got to where i am now because of my hard work rather than anybody elses
7098595 ive seen babyshambles a couple of times but its not that awe inspiring just him clattering around a stage drunk and off his face
7098596 the person who sat there with his acoustic guitar singing his poems and songs is the person who inspired me and its sad because people cant see it they mock you for saying hes an influence but if they were to see the talent behind all the charade they would maybe understand a bit better
7098597 when i was young and looking up to travis it felt like me and them whereas now things have levelled out people can get in touch with you and they can talk to you and tell you what your music does for them
7098598 before i was signed i could write a song and id know if it was good or not now when i do it i have no idea if its good rubbish or indifferent i just cant tell any more you wonder if people are going to like it if its going to be good enough i just cant tell
7098599 ive had a really happy life and a happy existence so im not going to write those broken hearted oh my god my life is over sort of emotional songs because its just not happened to me
7098600 i prefer to write from experience rather than just write a whole load of trite stuff that doesnt make sense if you think youre going to write a love song for the hell of it then its false it doesnt mean anything to you so hows it going to mean anything to the millions of people that might be listening to it
7098601 i can write a song and it can make someone ive never met and who lives miles away from me feel good about themselves
7098602 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7098603 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe

7098651 es ist nat rlich sehr sch n hier von der pole zu starten die strecke ist nicht sehr einfach die oberfl che ist sehr rutschig ich hatte eine gute runde und konnte die pole position holen ich glaube dass ich ein gutes auto habe das rennen morgen wird schwierig aber ich werde mein bestes geben
7098652 ich glaube dass ich mir die pole im ersten sektor holte der war einfach fantastisch ich habe dann im zweiten sektor ein paar fehler gemacht denn dort hat man je nach kurve ber oder untersteuern der dritte sektor war dann wieder gut aber ich habe alles im ersten sektor geholt
7098653 wie lief das bisherige wochenende gesamt und was denkst du ber die strecke
7098654 es wird immer besser die rundenzeiten wurden schon gestern immer besser je mehr gummi auf die bahn gelegt wird desto besser werden die zeiten auch die balance dann ging gestern ein schauer nieder der f r den grip sicher nicht gut ist also war es heute morgen wieder schwierig aber die strecke ist sch n
7098655 ja wir haben ein gro artiges auto das haben wir schon bei einigen rennen in diesem jahr gezeigt auch im vergangenen rennen war das der fall aber solche dinge passieren eben wir haben hier wieder gezeigt dass wir konkurrenzf hig sind das ist wichtig auch das team hat toll gearbeitet sowohl im simulator als wir die beste grundbalance f r den anfang suchten als auch gestern an der strecke
7098656 ich dachte schon bei der ersten runde in q3 dass die runde gut war aber da denkt man auch dass die anderen fehler machen w rden oder keine guten runden h tten man muss es immer ein zweites mal versuchen ich habe versucht einen besseren ersten sektor zu fahren ich war ein paar zehntel schneller als beim ersten versuch und der war schon gut
7098657 f r den zweiten versuch hast du aber auch die weichen reifen aufgezogen bei der ersten runde waren noch die h rteren drauf
7098658 ja ich war mir nicht sicher bei den reifen am morgen war ich mir noch sicher dass ich die harten im qualifying nehmen w rde aber in q1 und q2 war es dann etwas seltsam dann habe ich meine meinung ge ndert und den h rteren reifen beim ersten versuch und den weicheren beim zweiten probiert das war die richtige entscheidung
7098659 machst du dir gedanken dass die pole position erst auf der linken seite war und nun rechts
7098660 sie haben es ja ge ndert sie ist nun rechts die pole position ist sehr wichtig man muss als erster auf der richtigen linie sein und jeder f hrt dort auf der rechten seite da w re es seltsam die pole auf der linken seite zu haben dann w re es ja besser man w rde als zweiter starten nun ist es wieder normal
7098661 wie waren die ersten beiden qualifyingdurchg nge denn da tauchten doch eher ungewohnte namen an der spitze auf
7098662 ja das war etwas seltsam in q1 fahren wir meist mit angefahrenen reifen und erwartet da nicht unbedingt an der spitze zu sein mit einem neuen reifensatz fuhr ich in q2 keine so gute runde ich musste noch eine runde drehen auch andere haben einen weiteren satz verwendet die zeiten der anderen waren aber beeindruckend vor allem von vettel er hat das toll gemacht es war aber auch seltsam f r uns
7098663 wie berwindet man eine so gro e entt uschung wie in ungarn mit dem ausfall
7098664 die sommerpause hat da nicht geholfen denn nach so einem schlechten rennen m chte man gleich das n chste bestreiten manchmal ist so eine frustration aber auch gut um einen zu motivieren ich hielt kontakt zum team auch ber die sommerpause hinweg um auch sie zu motivieren ich fahre das auto aber das auto ist ein ferrari und es geh rt vielen leuten da waren alle entt uscht daher ist es sch n hierher zu kommen und auf pole zu stehen

7098677 a lot of minnesotans remember those great times and want those great times to return badly
7098678 i think this stadium is going to allow minnesotans to rally around football being back on campus and allow us to reconnect with that great tradition and history of gophers football
7098679 the flags would be flying the fraternities would be out people cheering saturday was a special day
7098680 i think something is missing and i think its missing more today than it was when they moved to the dome
7098681 all the things that now surround college football have made it far more of an event than a game we have not had the event weve still had the game but we have not had the event
7098682 we were a whole lot closer to the bottom than we were to the top
7098683 the additional revenue means i think that were going to keep viable at least in the immediate future a 25 sport athletic program
7098684 its a critical link between the stadium and the academic interests
7098685 its a heartstring appeal sometimes people come back and its about the memories and the great times they had at the u
7098686 weve got to put a football team on the field that can win
7098687 heck you put a team out there thats not going to win it doesnt matter what stadium youre in right
7098688 i was all in favor of going into the dome
7098689 how it turned out winning is of course everything to it
7098690 i dont believe anybody is going to buy tickets for very long to see the facility
7098691 you can walk through the facility and see it for nothing
7098692 when recruits come to games now at the metrodome we are at a competitive disadvantage
7098693 right now kids can go to other places in the big ten and across the country and have a better game day experience than theyre going to have at minnesota
7098694 we never had a chance to show recruits where they are going to play
7098695 it was always set up for something else like a snowmobile race or monster truck show it looked nothing like football
7098696 this is our locker room we decorate it nobody else is in here this is our house our home you cant do that when youre sharing with so many other people

7098698 marcum has had seven starts since hes come back off the dl and he hasnt really located the ball real well
7098699 he really hasnt been himself so were going to give him a couple starts down in triple a just to see if he can get his mechanics back together
7098700 weve got some chance to catch these guys and we want to put the best possible group out there we can right now hes just been struggling throwing strikes so we want to just let him go down and work out some of the kinks
7098701 we wouldnt send the guy down if he was hurt obviously
7098702 were in a pennant race here so its hard to just work on those things and keep running him out there
7098703 but we like him a lot hes going to be fine were going to try to do like we did with litsch and get his stuff back together a little bit thats the place syracuse he can work on it more than here

7098707 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

7098711 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7098712 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
7098713 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
7098714 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
7098715 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

7098748 the good thing about tennis this year is that you have many players who are winning some major events
7098749 its a bigger competition its more attractive for the fans
7098750 i know there are some hungry guys desperate to make some type of mark
7098751 you dont ever know when youre going to see the beginning of the end
7098752 when you lose a little bit of that swagger guys in any sport pick up on that
7098753 you work for years to built that invincibility knowing that at some point its going to break the mirror is going to break
7098754 ive enjoyed it talking about it being compared to the greatest
7098755 its a nice challenge beating the next generation trying to play for a long time trying to stay healthy trying to beat records
7098756 its always been difficult to beat all these guys its just not so easy to keep it up all the time eventually sometimes they get you
7098757 i think thats maybe what i feel most this year you know just losing too many matches
7098758 i look forward to the u s open i still have really this and then the masters cup in shanghai to really do well now try to save my season
7098759 the last years i did very well too i was very happy being the no 2 so finally im no 1
7098760 i dont have time to celebrate so probably after new york after davis cup im going to have a good time
7098761 i feel like im playing really solid and much better than i have been all year to be honest i really look forward to it
7098762 you know it can turn around in a split of a second
7098763 who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented and famous
7098764 i will dance on the chains of my circumstance walk on the waves of the storm nothing is impossible for those who believe god is love
7098765 we dont know when he will act in his time no doubt not ours in the meantime he would like us to do what we can on our own

7098773 are you looking for something that conveys gratitude this christmas
7098774 in the last five months everything that could go wrong has gone wrong
7098775 youd think after three years of getting the special i wouldnt be so moved by its significance but i can feel it right here all over again
7098776 ah that lady just left with uh she left with no flowers
7098777 i cut off the flowers thats the special i call it the christmas thorns bouquet barbara came into the shop three years ago feeling much as you do today
7098778 she thought she had very little to be thankful for she had just lost her father to cancer the family business was failing her son had gotten into drugs and she was facing major surgery that same year i had lost my husband
7098779 for the first time in my life i had to spend the holidays alone i had no children no husband no family nearby and too much debt to allow any travel
7098780 ive always thanked god for the good things in my life and i never questioned him why those good things happened to me but when the bad stuff hit i cried out why why me it took time for me to learn that the dark times are important to our faith i have always enjoyed the flowers of my life but it took the thorns to show me the beauty of gods comfort you know the bible says that god comforts us when were afflicted and from his consolation we learn to comfort others
7098781 i guess the truth is i dont want comfort ive lost a baby and im angry with god
7098782 i dont know if i can be thankful for the thorns in my life
7098783 my experience has shown me that the thorns make the roses more precious we treasure gods providential care more during trouble than at any other time remember that it was a crown of thorns that jesus wore so we might know his love dont resent the thorns

7098811 a day of shame for the senate and a day of shame for women
7098812 im sure you remember nobody played advocate for her i dont think he did well and he bears responsibility for mr thomas being on the court
7098813 was accused of being labeled racist so the republicans were blackmailing him and he pushed the levers to make the case look like there wasnt a case when there was
7098814 he did everything to make it be good for thomas and to slant it against her
7098815 there was in fact a concern about whether or not to make the guy look stupid what would happen if you embarrassed him
7098816 in fairness to thomas which in retrospect he didnt deserve
7098817 i dont know if other people still care after all these years
7098818 if the polls are correct 85 percent to 86 percent of the country knew who i was and had an opinion of me thats a highly unusual exposure for a senator

7098839 i started working on this the night i was elected to the senate
7098840 it involved two indian tribes two endangered species the cities of reno and sparks pyramid lake the truckee and carson rivers and lake tahoe

7098846 si tienes un juego interno plenamente desarrollado que tenga su ra z en una plena confianza en uno mismo libre de distracciones y acompa ado por una autoestima sana sigue siendo importante el juego externo
7098847 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next
7098848 at times of extraordinary volatility and dramatic risk re pricing maintaining price stability could be the best contribution that monetary policy could give to the return to financial stability
7098849 there will be no change in monetary policy for the foreseeable future
7098850 the emphasis still is on the economic and market risks but still trying to walk a fine line on inflation as well
7098851 nevertheless the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain not least because of the difficulty of predicting the future course of commodity prices and we will continue to monitor inflation and inflation expectations closely
7098852 is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to attain that objective
7098853 add to this mix a jump in inflation in part the product of a global commodity boom and the result has been one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
7098854 we will continue to review all of our liquidity facilities to determine if they are having their intended effects or require modification
7098855 austin is a great athlete and every way we can use him we will plan on it
7098856 again i just dont know yet how much volume he can take so most likely we will limit punt and kickoff return reps for a while until we see how he handles the receiving part of it
7098857 last year for probably the last four to five weeks we had a small part of the offense in the plan for austin and it was situational against teams that we thought might be vulnerable to a given thing or just situations we thought he could manage extremely well
7098858 so it has been in place prior and then i would say increased urgency where i wasnt pleased with our backup quarterback play last saturday gave me more urgency now to think that role needs to be back and maybe expanded in the event that max were hurt
7098859 thinks he has a gun and he likes to show if off
7098860 we think he can certainly get the ball to him as a possible quarterback candidate in different plays so how we are going to use him and in what volume that remains to be seen but he will be used as much as he can be
7098861 best one so far since ive been the coach i think it is because the program is reaching more maturity to where we dont have as many issues with older players who are on scout team and that is difficult to them
7098862 most of the younger players are anxious to carve their way and are more talented so that combination gives you a lot better chance to be prepared going into the games especially early in the year

7098875 general anatoly nogovitsyn deputy chief of staff of the russian military revealed tuesday the extent of the military assistance moscow claimed jerusalem had given georgia
7098876 eight types of military vehicles explosives landmines and special explosives for the clearing minefields
7098877 1 gomer progenitor of the ancient cimerians and cimbri from whom are descended the celtic family
7098878 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
7098879 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
7098880 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
7098881 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
7098882 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
7098883 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
7098884 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
7098885 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
7098886 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
7098887 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
7098888 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
7098889 most of the things we depend upon would be gone and we would literally be depending on our own assets and those we could reach by walking to them
7098890 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
7098891 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
7098892 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
7098893 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
7098894 one of the nations in the middle east had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel they had taken a short range probably scud missile put it on a transporter erector launcher lowered it in taken the vessel out into the water peeled back the top erected it fired it lowered it and covered it up and the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50 60 100 other ships operating in the immediate area
7098895 well known to the white house but have not been disseminated to the appropriate congressional committees
7098896 could be used in a devastating stealth attack against the united states or israel for which the united states has no known or planned defense
7098897 the use of an atomic bomb against israel would destroy israel completely while the same against the islamic only would cause damages such a scenario is not inconceivable
7098898 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
7098899 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
7098900 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
7098901 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
7098902 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
7098903 as of today we have no defense against such an attack
7098904 the life of this regime has come to an end

7099114 im just trying to take the points situation the best i can
7099115 im trying not to think about it im trying to think about the good race tracks we have coming up bristol california richmond those are good tracks for us so i try to focus on the positive and not really think about the points
7099116 i think the first year of the chase we tried altering our testing schedule when we used to be able to pick our tests and that kind of backfired on us

7099200 lovinsky abduction was reportedly made to look like a kidnapping for ransom on tuesday 14 august the alleged abductors called family asking for a ransom of usd 300 000 however there has been no further contact from the abductors
7099201 lovinsky pierre antoine graduated in psychology from the haitian state university and obtained further specialisation on child psychology in montreal canada he has been involved for several years as a grass roots community organizer mainly working with children in the early 1990s he co founded the foundation for the support of children fondsayon kore timoun yo for young street children in port au prince and a centre for teenage mothers foyer pour m res adolescentes
7099202 i know it was a difficult decision for lovinsky because he knew the risks and he had a family that he loved but in the end lovinsky felt he could not stay out of haiti any longer that he was needed to help organize progressive grassroots voices in haiti
7099203 i last saw lovinsky in person in february 2007 at the time he was receiving threats and frequently changing where he slept he knew he was in danger but also knew that in haitis democratic transition that the traditional forces would have the upper hand he knew that if the people did not organize life would become more difficult for the majority of haitians who are poor
7099204 i have not heard of any report from any haitian authorities on lovinskys disappearance despite requests from lovinskys family fondasyon trant septanm members of the u s congress and human rights and haiti solidarity activists from around the world
7099205 we also know that the police have repeatedly failed to follow up on leads they have been provided it is hard to escape the conclusion that the haitian government is not reporting on its investigation because it is not conducting one
7099206 calling for the authorities to ensure wilson mesiliens protection in accordance with his wishes
7099207 i cannot explain why lovinsky was left out of the working groups report the un mission in haiti issued a press release about it the abduction was in the news amnesty international and other human rights groups issued action alerts the omission was especially troubling because lovinsky was such a high profile human rights activist and candidate for the senate elections
7099208 i want to see a focused vision of spiritual maturity the expansion of the soul is the best phrase i can use for it that is a renewed sense of the momentousness of being alive the sheer bigness and awesomeness of being a human being alive in gods world with light with grace with wisdom with responsibility with biblical truth
7099209 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7099210 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share

7099212 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7099213 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7099214 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
7099215 they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that

7099220 now the two basic elements of communication that we are going to take a look at in the areas of prison issues are auditory and non verbal auditory is based on how inmates communicate by speaking or tone of voice or even singing
7099221 the difference between you guys inmates and us officers is that a lot of us has never been caught
7099222 i dont think we should talk to each other for awhile
7099223 you know its hard being down when i talk to you
7099224 yang bersangkutan tidak masuk nomor urut jadi itu yang mungkin membuat kecewa
7099225 jadi dia membuka hal yang dahulu ya kalau mau buka sejak dulu saja bukan sekarang
7099226 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7099227 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7099228 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden
7099229 hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
7099230 ill say yes to that idea but not because it is already running or anything
7099231 im just saying yes because its possible i think it is possible sorry to say we dont have specific plans at the moment but it is possible yes
7099232 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
7099233 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
7099234 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
7099235 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
7099236 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7099237 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7099238 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
7099239 kj noons versus nick diaz is definitely not happening on oct 4 i still believe kj noons can defend his title
7099240 i still believe kj noons is a man of honor he comes from a great family a fighting family hes a great kid hes a great athlete i think hes just being mismanaged right now
7099241 there are so many people in this room that inspire us and keep us alive so i just want to thank everyone for keeping lead singer
7099242 im speechless i dont know what to say i wish there was more of us here i just showed up for the booze
7099243 amid the controversies of the ministerial hierarchy the cpn uml will stay out of the government
7099244 we have not said we wont accept cpn uml leader in the second position in the protocol ranking we are ready to show flexibility regarding this
7099245 obamas in much better shape because he seems to have very good standing in the places that john kerry won and very good opportunities in a number of other states that look like they could go to the democrats
7099246 mccains fundamental problem is theres only one way home for him replicate the bush electoral victory state by state
7099247 the fundamental truth remains that this race is extremely tight mccain is in strong position in ohio and florida two states that have been critical for republican victories and hes better positioned today in michigan than the president was in either 2000 or 2004
7099248 me gusta mucho esta carrera porque soy de madrid y no tengo muchas oportunidades de correr en casa y de subir unos puertos en los que suelo entrenarme me hace una ilusi n enorme
7099249 the last primary season is a direct result of 1968
7099250 had there been party leaders who had a major role in choosing the nominee this year it is probably much more likely it would have been a hillary clinton rather than a young barack obama
7099251 i think people figured if these guys cant run a convention without battling each other in the street and on the floor of the convention hall how the hell can they run the country
7099252 as representatives and senators saw the way students were taking to the streets they thought wed be better off if we channeled this into regular participation and not street politics
7099253 it became one of those images that has lasted and stuck with us
7099254 they came here to agitate and they did a fantastic job
7099255 accountability and self reliance love of country working hard without making excuses treating your neighbor as youd like to be treated
7099256 her fear of black men who passed by her on the street
7099257 where decency and endurance and the pioneer spirit were joined at the hip with conformity and suspicion and the potential for unblinking cruelty
7099258 but that was the age difference and not that she was mean or anything
7099259 generally shunned the tent revival circuit preferring a straight backed form of methodism that valued reason over passion and temperance over both
7099260 blanched whenever someone mentioned the subject and hoped to carry the secret to her grave
7099261 would turn her head in profile to show off her beaked nose which along with a pair of jet black eyes was offered as proof of cherokee blood
7099262 the thought occurred to me maybe that would be a good slogan for her grandson
7099263 glenn miller tommy dorsey benny goodman harry james i dont think there was a one from that era that we didnt have at the blue moon
7099264 black slicked back hair and his perpetual wise guy grin
7099265 gramps is probably too busy telling one of his jokes or arguing with toot their version of the hawaiian word
7099266 toot notices but shes polite enough to bite her lip and offer dessert her instincts warn her against making a scene
7099267 every morning she woke up at five a m and changed from the frowsy muu muus sic she wore around the apartment into a tailored suit and high heeled pumps
7099268 here you graduated from college so you should be able to figure out this file
7099269 i was young and just graduated and thought i could kill the world
7099270 she really put me straight she made a point of indicating that experience is equitable to going to college and she was right
7099271 never stopped dreaming of a house with a white picket fence days spent baking or playing bridge or volunteering at the local library
7099272 your grandfather and i just figured we should treat people decently bar
7099273 shes wise that way my grandmother suspicious of overwrought sentiments or overblown claims content with common sense
7099274 before you came in she told me the fella was black thats the real reason why shes bothered
7099275 never had they given me reason to doubt their love i doubted if they ever would
7099276 and yet i knew that men who might easily have been my brothers could still inspire their rawest fears
7099277 than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe
7099278 she was really a very liberal person liberal in politics and i think liberal in thinking
7099279 frankly that story when it was in the book i felt didnt need to be in there
7099280 from our grandmother he gets his pragmatism his levelheadedness his ability to stay centered in the eye of the storm
7099281 i used to think i dont know whos the supervisor here me or her
7099282 when stanley was still alive they would go on cruises around the islands and theyd do nothing but play bridge
7099283 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team biden s selection is good news for obama and america
7099284 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7099285 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden
7099286 hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
7099287 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
7099288 si bien es cierto que nosotros no tenemos todas las posibilidades de fiscalizar muro a muro nuestra regi n s vamos a sentar precedente en acciones ejemplificadoras con carabineros y particularmente con los municipios
7099289 se vulnera un principio b sico que es el ejercicio democr tico de hacer propaganda de acuerdo a la normativa vigente y si eso se vulnera la gente lo va a castigar electoralmente
7099290 muchos en el pasado tal vez hicimos rayados pero ahora no se puede

7099294 en osaa siit olla eri mielt todelliset kustannukset joita laittomat lakot aiheuttavat voivat olla eri maailmasta kuin hyvityssakot kiistattomasti se on kysymys joka ansaitsisi pohdintaa
7099295 no tiene mucho sentido usar este tipo de descalificaciones de pretextos y excusas aqu lo que hay es que el partido socialista tiene tomada una decisi n de trabajar por tener un candidato nico por la concertaci n y jos miguel insulza lo nico que hace es manifestar la voluntad del partido de llegar a esa meta
7099296 insulza dice que est disponible s lo en la eventualidad de que haya acuerdo para una candidatura presidencial del com n de la concertaci n es porque tiene la convicci n de que es lo mejor para el bloque y para chile
7099297 during the summer of 2006 there were no attacks on ships at all
7099298 barack is about to choose a running mate and he wants you to know first
7099299 hey this fellow is dark enough to be considered black so lets call him that the first black presidential nominee
7099300 right now there are crack addicts all over the planet and none of them asked to be born or to be the victims of this very dangerous drug

7099316 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense

7099320 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
7099321 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
7099322 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
7099323 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves

7099328 its not done until its done and the discussions are really ongoing and ongoing and ongoing but hopefully drawing to a conclusion
7099329 kan du gi meg en god grunn til ikke gi opp
7099330 da jeg plantet fr ene til bregnene og bambusen tok jeg godt vare p dem jeg ga dem lys og jeg ga dem vann bregnene vokste raskt og deres skinnende gr nne blader dekket marken bambus fr ene derimot ga ikke noe resultat men jeg ga ikke opp bambusen det andre ret vokste bregnene seg st rre og videre enn ret f r mens ingenting kom opp fra bambus fr ene jeg ga fortsatt ikke opp bambus fr ene
7099331 det tredje ret kom det fortsatt ingenting opp fra bambus fr ene men jeg ville ikke gi opp dem det fjerde ret ingenting fra bambus fr ene jeg ville ikke gi opp
7099332 s det femte ret kom det en liten spire opp av jorden fra bambus fr ene sammenlignet med bregnene var den ynkelig og nesten usynlig men etter bare 6 m neder var bambusen vokst til over 30 meters h yde den hadde brukt fem r p utvikle r tter disse gjorde den sterk og ga den det den trengte for overleve jeg ville aldri gi en av mine skapninger en utfordring som de ikke ville mestre
7099333 visste du at hele den tiden du har kjempet har du i virkeligheten utviklet r tter
7099334 jeg nektet gi ikke opp bambus fr ene jeg vil aldri gi opp deg
7099335 bambusen hadde en annen funksjon enn bregnen likevel gj r begge skogen vakker

7099343 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7099344 watch the first obama biden rally live at 3pm et on www barackobama com spread the word
7099345 friend i have some important news that i want to make official ive chosen joe biden to be my running mate
7099346 judging by the conduct of mr tsvangirai i have no doubt that zimbabweans are a determined people
7099347 but daddy how would we be heard by the world if we do not speak in english
7099348 boost californias economy by over 683 6 million in direct spending over the next three years
7099349 what we can do is tend our own garden and make sure that its weeded and i think weve weeded out a discriminatory law
7099350 while casting initiatives as the secret determinant of presidential elections makes for an interesting narrative it is largely a work of fiction
7099351 i think there are some pretty major issues on the minds of voters that are going to take precedence
7099352 care about the economic issues and the health care issues and getting out of iraq
7099353 the most intrusive means by the state to regulate marriage
7099354 the bigger issues will be the economy terrorism healthcare energy
7099355 with gas approaching 5 a gallon and the mortgage crisis hopefully people are less easily whipped up with bullshit social issues and right wing fear and smear tactics
7099356 the dialogue is happening on a personal level folks are talking about what it means for their families
7099357 but it gives people that sense of hope that things are headed in the right direction
7099358 jesp re que les gens sortiront du d bat en se disant quon est cons
7099359 nous allons tous rejoindre une table vide qui n tait occup e par personne
7099360 oui nous pouvons d passer ce qui nous a s par s on pourra gagner des tas de gens qui restent sceptiques sur nous

7099367 les verts sont daccord pour participer ce rassemblement et ne pas dire quils en sont les chefs
7099368 you give them an inch they will take a mile
7099369 it is obvious that 17 year old boys getting behind the wheel of a high performance car is asking for trouble mr carpenter said
7099370 weve got to stop that from happening its about the safety of the broader community and the safety of the young kids themselves
7099371 and ordinary people do not want to be terrorised by hoons some of these accidents have come ploughing into peoples houses
7099372 but as a general rule young kids invariably boys dont need as their first vehicle to be driving a high performance car mr carpenter said
7099373 elizabeth police made two arrests following a terrifying incident where a woman had a car stolen while she was sitting in it
7099374 given the way the suspension was chewed up on the ford id say they were travelling around 80km h or more when they hit
7099375 after a series of frantic phone calls during the day today we have reached an agreement with chelsea
7099376 andriy returns to the rossoneri tomorrow he will be in milan monday he will undergo a medical then he will sign a contract and from tuesday he will be available to carlo ancelotti
7099377 we succeeded in bringing home the player who in the last 50 years has scored the most goals in our shirt
7099378 president silvio berlusconi and i am happy as is our coach and i believe also our players
7099379 i believe that milan are the only club in the world to have three european players of the year in our squad
7099380 andriy has returned home and i am happy about it i am a milan fan and i am very happy
7099381 ive spoken to andriy 48 times in the past three hours the terms of the agreement are very private
7099382 between today and tomorrow andriy will be at milan and he will start again his life as a milan player
7099383 andriy made a mistake in leaving and i believe that in the past two years he has realised that this is his home
7099384 i want proof from emergency hospital wards that there are fewer kids being brought in with binge drinking related problems since the tax was introduced in the may budget i want evidence from the police that theyre reporting less binge drinking related offences among young people since the tax came in they are the two things we want to be convinced of before wed vote for the measure
7099385 if there is nothing to be afraid of let their kids be x rayed
7099386 a caucasian girl is going to fuse her knee centers at about age 15 theyre going to fuse their iliac crest at about age 16 and part of the elbow will start fusing around 13 or 14
7099387 of course everybody who gets arrested says they are 17
7099388 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
7099389 natural born citizen meant you were born in the contiguous u s
7099390 as the associated presss ron fournier noted in an analysis this morning picking biden shows that obama and his team are concerned that questions of whether the illinois senator is ready for the job have the potential to be politically dangerous
7099391 define super liberal and exactly what is wrong with that
7099392 biden has also been vetted at the national stage at least twice during his runs for president in 1987 and 2008 that means almost certainly that everything bad or unsavory about biden we deal with the plagiarism issue below is known to the media and lessens the chances of some sort of revelation over the next few months that takes obama off message
7099393 if you think that there is a good reason to not vote for me then i have chosen biden as my vp just to assuage your concerns
7099394 our initial thoughts about the obama biden ticket are below feel free to add your own in the comments section
7099395 old politics white senior dc pol who knows what hes teaching the young president
7099396 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time
7099397 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
7099398 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
7099399 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you

7099421 this is a great moment to see people supporting our cause to show solidarity with us and to tell the world a message that the unfair siege imposed on the gaza strip should end very soon

7099431 might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
7099432 when there exists a legitimate public interest in the disclosure of the information
7099433 as a result the attorney has agreed not to sign the plan before congress gets a proper look at it on september 17th
7099434 warning raw1394 kernel module not loaded or failure to read write dev raw 1394
7099435 it cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7099436 the official policy rate is a rather ineffective tool for addressing liquidity and solvency issues
7099437 i do not agree that the best that can be done is for the authorities to clean up the mess after the bubble bursts
7099438 all three have allowed themselves to be used as quasi fiscal agents of the state providing subsidies to banks and other highly leveraged institutions
7099439 the feds reputation for maintaining price stability has been severely dented
7099440 this is what she does she hands out checks to fire departments for money that came from bills she voted against
7099441 she talks at the va about the importance of the gi bill congress just passed that she voted against she talks about the importance of renewable energy but shes voted against every renewable energy bill thats come up
7099442 and its the same with the bridge she cant have it both ways
7099443 alternative energy is o k but we have to keep looking for oil its been around for a long time and its going to be around a long time
7099444 she is one of the only ones ive ever heard talking seriously about renewable fuel sources
7099445 isnt it funny roger how the arrested development of those weve ahem left behind is so screamingly obvious
7099446 has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good
7099447 has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their sustenance
7099448 has kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the consent of our legislatures
7099449 affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power
7099450 combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving assent to their acts of pretended legislation
7099451 already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages
7099452 misdemeanors by imposing excessive bail and pre sentence jailing in order to force americans into pleading into guilt by drafting procedures designed to deny evidence and generally stacking the rules in favor of the government
7099453 the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the p eople
7099454 there will not be any north american union that will include the republic of the united states of america nor will any form of new world government or new world order be tolerated anywhere within the republic of the united states of america

7099461 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen

7099464 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
7099465 i want to introduce my two uncles carl johnson and carl matthes from california who just got married theyve been together for over 41 years
7099466 as your president i will use the bully pulpit to urge states to treat same sex couples with full equality in their family and adoption laws i personally believe that civil unions represent the best way to secure that equal treatment but i also believe that the federal government should not stand in the way of states that want to decide on their own how best to pursue equality for gay and lesbian couples whether that means a domestic partnership a civil union or a civil marriage unlike senator clinton i support the complete repeal of the defense of marriage act doma a position i have held since before arriving in the u s senate while some say we should repeal only part of the law i believe we should get rid of that statute altogether federal law should not discriminate in any way against gay and lesbian couples which is precisely what doma does i have also called for us to repeal dont ask dont tell and i have worked to improve the uniting american families act so we can afford same sex couples the same rights and obligations as married couples in our immigration system
7099467 barnes amp nobles decision not to bid reflects in part the tight lending markets that likely would make it difficult to arrange bank financing the retailer was also known to be concerned about the length of some of the leases that borders has signed
7099468 the closer examination of sales will reveal that even in this soft retail environment across america the book business is stubbornly holding up if we normalized our sales without the impact of harry potter and its add on sales last year throw in the double digit decline were still experiencing in the music business the rest of our business was relatively flat so as weve said for many years the book business is a relatively stable business

7099472 the guy in the smoking hot not quite in love relationship
7099473 in selecting sen joe biden as his running mate sen obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of
7099474 sen bidens record in the united states senate is one of support and understanding that has been unwavering throughout his career
7099475 we only need to look back to the recent passage of the repeal of the hiv travel and immigration ban to see the type of leadership we can expect from sen biden on the issues important to our community
7099476 it was because of his determination and tenacity that we were able to see this relic of discrimination against people living with hiv aids torn down
7099477 if the support sen biden has proven on our issues is any indication of the type of vice president he will be than our community can be assured that sen obama has chosen a thoughtful and staunch advocate for equality as his closest adviser
7099478 who help us maintain our bottomlines in this fiercely competitive grey market
7099479 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
7099480 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
7099481 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
7099482 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
7099483 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
7099484 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
7099485 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
7099486 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
7099487 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
7099488 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
7099489 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
7099490 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence
7099491 a lot depends on what type of exposure you as a parent give your child
7099492 if you do not get the barbie for me i will not get well
7099493 if my father cannot afford an ipod for me why is he working
7099494 i have seen my parents living a plush life my father owns two cars my mother has a car exclusively for herself they both have all the gadgets and gizmos that they fancy why should i be deprived
7099495 i have my eyes on a laptop i have promised that i will do well in my boards to get it but i know my parents will buy it for me even if i dont
7099496 parents succumb because they feel they have no other way out
7099497 i see parents buying their kids just about anything they lay their hands on irrespective of whether the child needs it or not
7099498 theres no question i lost the fight but the judges were a disgrace they should be docked points this is the worst country in the world they shouldnt even be hosting the games
7099499 i dont care they can keep it for all i care
7099500 i am so blessed it is an overwhelming feeling of joy and pride god knows its been hard i wanted to cry and laugh at the same time
7099501 i figure if i won whatever i said would come from the heart
7099502 these limits are to the benefit of women not against them
7099503 we are in politics in technology in advanced studies we are in parliament
7099504 we now have an islamic pool and we can get comfortable
7099505 my brother used to be an obedient boy but he changed over the last three years
7099506 last year arka a class 8 student of chandragati high school failed to clear the final examinations
7099507 he had become absent minded this year his attendance at school was irregular
7099508 he had taken all the necessary steps to carry out and erase traces of his involvement like any other professional criminal
7099509 after pushing sheuli from almost a height of 25 feet he came down the building took the ipod and strangled her to make sure she was dead he smashed her head with a stone and then returned home
7099510 he did not have a good reputation in this locality no parent would allow their child to be friendly with arka
7099511 we knew that one day he might do something grievously wrong so when people came to my house to ask my son about sheuli i handed him over to them
7099512 we have tried our best to correct him we punished him we consulted doctors and 8230 just to make him a good human being but we failed
7099513 she would describe an experiment and say thanks to allah it turned out well
7099514 what we have learned from her is that she was in custody for over five years
7099515 i have no doubt that there really are real terrorists out there but she isnt one of them
7099516 shes a dangerous person with a lot of ability and the investigation will show how far along she may have been with any plot
7099517 we still live in the country that was built by ivan the terrible
7099518 people like putin they have no other idea of how to rule
7099519 what russia does now it cannot be analyzed with modern political logic it is obsolete if modern countries like the u s declare war they have more or less rational reasons even if they are mistaken
7099520 you shouldnt expect logic from a kgb lieutenant colonel anyway you shouldnt expect modern political thinking
7099521 russia is a big and capable country which will not let the west dictate the conditions
7099522 in any situation russia is going to act as it sees fit
7099523 russia has never been conquered not in 1 000 years though many tried
7099524 its because its in our genes not to allow anyone to dictate the conditions how to act where to act
7099525 theyve realized that if russia merely plays the role the west has made for it we would quickly become a country that protects the pipeline sending gas and oil from western siberia
7099526 it is too early to bury russia as a great power
7099527 what makes the situation even more difficult is that all these small nations which existed between russia and the heart of europe they have rushed to join europe
7099528 to us the main objective is to bring peace and stability in this area
7099529 no they leave us alone and we leave them alone
7099530 no they might encourage people to observe islamic law but most of us do so anyway
7099531 if anybody says anything bad about the taliban theyll go after them
7099532 why is the government bombing our homes the taliban want to bring peace to the area
7099533 it is because of these atrocities that people are giving the militants more and more sympathy
7099534 the two of us had plans for what we were going to do but you could say our whole lives stopped
7099535 and believe me when you see someone dying of aids its really bad its different each time no one dies the same way
7099536 this aids study was it seems the beginning of many years of research being carried out on me without my knowledge or consent
7099537 if as the ethics application form states consent was obtained from all subjects how is it that i did not know about my aids status until 1987
7099538 i did not know anything about his studies or research
7099539 i believe nonconsensual research was conducted by doctors of hemophilia in this country
7099540 frustration a sense of being repeatedly betrayed there are lessons to be learned that havent been learned yet
7099541 its like sitting on your back porch and driving your house
7099542 their projected rates of expansion are so fast that we dont have a hope in hell of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
7099543 we are blessed by the fact that our friend and neighbor is also our number one supplier of foreign oil
7099544 the amount of energy that you have to use to get that oil out of the ground is such that it actually creates a much greater impact on climate change as well as using much more energy than even traditional petroleum
7099545 if american mayors want to send their money to unstable undemocratic countries in the middle east instead of to canada that will be their call if they want to pay a premium for iranian saudi iraqi oil that will be their call
7099546 do you think americans are going to be paying a buck or a buck fifty more because somebody said that our carbon footprint is higher than oil from kazakhstan
7099547 you have to consider the environmental impact in a broader context
7099548 there is significant economic benefit from the development of oil sands the oil sands represent a very secure reliable long term source of supply to the united states people in the u s will have to judge whether that supply stacks up to other alternatives
7099549 they say no no were going to do research and really clean up our act well you cant give these guys permission to go ahead on the promise that something is going to happen in the future
7099550 for 40 years a couple of oil companies worked on the tar sands extraction process not its environmental impacts it was albertas massive expansion of tar sands leasing over the last few years ignoring serious unanswered environmental and public health concerns that created this mushrooming crisis
7099551 it would be the equivalent of several hundred exxon valdez oil spills
7099552 im just one of a chorus of people that are concerned
7099553 sunt foarte surprins de acest transfer nu m a teptam ca andrei ionescu s vin la steaua sincer v spun e un juc tor de perspectiv dar andrei ionescu e n stare de speran de mul i ani acum trebuie s tearg totul cu buretele i s o ia de la cap t e o ans mare pentru el

7099561 all i can say is that the movie shows the dark side of an internationally acclaimed indian classical music legend
7099562 the story follows delhi based musician shubhankar who goes to a small town to learn sitar from a famous maverick muslim musician the founder of the illustrious gharana while there he falls in love with his gurus daughter bhairavi
7099563 bhairavi also falls for shubhankar but she is the better musician of the two a la abhimaan once they are married shubhankar starts to play mind games with her to make her lose her faith in music so he can move ahead things go terribly wrong and a heartbroken bhairavi shuts herself away from the world forever
7099564 yeh kahani to hamari guru ma aur ravi shankarji ki hi ho sakti hai this has to be the story of my teacher and ravi shankarji
7099565 chaurasia who knows the couple from the time he learnt from annapoorna devi pandit ravi shankars first wife and ustad allaudin khans daughter says it is wrong to make a movie on someones personal life especially if it shows more negatives than positives
7099566 mahapurushon ko mahapurushon ki tarah hi dikhana chahiye legends should be portrayed as legends even if they dont say whom the movie is about people will understand as there have been biographies and books on them
7099567 eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth

7099572 the american russian law institute arli a non governmental organization promoting legal reform in russia on monday said that self exiled oligarch boris berezovsky wanted by russia was allowed to meet mr
7099573 berezovsky attempted to intimidate zeltser wanting him to recant his testimony and change it in favor of berezovsky
7099574 or else berezovsky said things will be worse for you because i am the lord of this country
7099575 the arli sent copies of the statement the belarusian foreign minister and a number of other belarusian and russian senior officials
7099576 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7099577 we were disappointed at the way we handled the situation there we knew it was going to be a tough in the morning session
7099578 we wanted to execute certain plans which we couldnt but that game has gone its a different wicket here different conditions here
7099579 in one day cricket batsmen hold the key they have more responsibility because runs on the board are vital they are the ones who control the game
7099580 the bowlers will come into play and create opportunities and put pressure on the opposition but at the same time the batsmen have more responsibility in that they have to get runs on the board
7099581 after the seaming conditions of dambulla the expectation all round was for more runs and jayawardene believed that this would be the case
7099582 it is a different wicket its much firmer than it used to be here
7099583 the ball will probably come on to the bat better so definitely there will be more runs
7099584 im sorry but i told you your defence would crack
7099585 we could have scored more goals had it not been for the wet ground
7099586 dont let social media take control of your brand get back in the drivers seat through strategic widget development
7099587 watching television can slow the development of children under 3 even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them

7099591 in the end i had to do the repairing despite all that we are leading it sounds great
7099592 the second days stages are even more tough lots of dust and tighter curves
7099593 tell everyone dont forget us tell them what you have seen down here
7099594 we were the favourites to win the gold and we have done it
7099595 after our quarterfinal win over the netherlands we showed that we were a superior team
7099596 though we did not play our best game today we somehow managed to win and that matters
7099597 i am very happy for all the moments i have lived here it is really a great feeling after all those anxious times i had to endure before the i joined the team

7099600 i had come here with dreams of helping our boxers win a medal and i am happy we have managed to clear that hurdle even in cuba amateur boxings holy grail people have started to know me its nice
7099601 i still think gurcharan could have been the first indian to win an olympic medal he will always be a special talent and dingko could have been the best in the world and 8230
7099602 sometimes when things dont go right i think about my wife and my girl back home
7099603 i have been coming to india so often that it would be difficult to train any other country now
7099604 my contract ends on august 31 i dont know what i will do next i can go back and say i have produced an olympic medallist and then say thats it
7099605 but you never know i might be back it will be difficult to stay away from indian boxers they are like my kids
7099606 i dont know if i can teach this present bunch anything more but this crop is fearless they are different from dinko and gurcharan theyve realised that in order to win points you dont have box fearlessly but be patient and intelligent they have so much confidence that they can conquer the world

7099699 we are out for the first time in three days of fear and ducking in our homes and we can go shopping today the islamists are patrolling the streets
7099700 more than 170 people have been admitted at our facility for treatment and 70 others were killed during the three days the clashes were running in the town there is not enough medicine worse than that we have only one doctor and few nurses that shows how we are unable to cope with such number of patients
7099701 the town is under our control and our fighters are still chasing the remnants of the bandits who have been running the town with the barrel of the gun i would ask people should be calm as there would not be any revenge
7099702 no clan has been chased out of the town by our fighters but bandits we came to the town with the help and will of its people and we will remain in control
7099703 the possibility of the defeated militia or any other troops challenging the islamist militia who are now in control is not simple and realistic because the government forces and their ethiopian backers cannot retake the town

7099709 it is obvious that 17 year old boys getting behind the wheel of a high performance car is asking for trouble mr carpenter said
7099710 weve got to stop that from happening its about the safety of the broader community and the safety of the young kids themselves
7099711 and ordinary people do not want to be terrorised by hoons some of these accidents have come ploughing into peoples houses
7099712 but as a general rule young kids invariably boys dont need as their first vehicle to be driving a high performance car mr carpenter said
7099713 i want proof from emergency hospital wards that there are fewer kids being brought in with binge drinking related problems since the tax was introduced in the may budget i want evidence from the police that theyre reporting less binge drinking related offences among young people since the tax came in they are the two things we want to be convinced of before wed vote for the measure

7099723 a lot of these people especially the graffiti artists dont really have anywhere to paint in the city so we thought this would be a great outlet for them as you can see we have kids and all sorts of people taking a stab at it
7099724 not at all we respect that the city is trying to get rid of graffiti but its not going to stop someone from being an artist and wanting to be an artist so this is a legal and safe way to do whatever you want on the side of a truck

7099728 the opening of the limnitis checkpoint is not connected to any other matter
7099729 we condemn all kinds of provocative actions that take place in that sensitive village of pyla wherever these may come from
7099730 our position regarding the issue of opening the limnitis checkpoint is well known and is not connected to anything else
7099731 we are working for the opening of the particular checkpoint as soon as possible because it will serve both the greek cypriots and the turkish cypriots in the area
7099732 the repetition of the well known stance of the greek cypriots and the extension of the claims of the greek cypriot side for suzerainty on the island

7099741 a voting system used in 34 states contains a critical programming error
7099742 the problem was identified after complaints from ohio elections officials following the march primary there but the logic error that is the root of the problem has been part of the software for 10 years said chris riggall a spokesman for premier election solutions
7099743 the flawed software is on both touch screen and optical scan voting machines made by premier and the problem with vote counts is most likely to affect larger jurisdictions that feed many memory cards to a central counting database rapidly

7099790 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for
7099791 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7099792 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7099793 the no 1 thing he brings to the ticket is foreign policy experience hes been in the senate for 30 years chaired the foreign relations committee and worked on these issues a long time he travels extensively and has very close relationships with a lot of the key leaders certainly in the whole israel palestine area in the middle east as well as pakistan and europe
7099794 i like joe biden many of us were hopeful that obamas selection would be sen hillary clinton and thats disappointing but again not surprising
7099795 ive worked side by side with joe for 16 years in the u s senate and ive seen his dedication to americas families firsthand joe has always been willing to take on the tough fights and stand up for what is right even when its not always the popular thing to do joe biden spoke up for domestic violence protections for women when no one else was talking about it he fought for the armor our troops need and deserve to do their jobs safely in iraq and he has stood with me time and again to protect our veterans workers and children
7099796 i think compared to the others that we read were on sen obamas list gov tim kaine of virginia and indiana sen evan bayh i think that biden is probably better known nationally
7099797 i think hes made a great pick with joe biden its not just foreign policy he has expertise in matters of the judiciary in his work for families
7099798 we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president

7099801 i have been with her and she is very aware of the mistakes that were made
7099802 it was the wrong decision and i think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that theres no doubt in my mind i would have made those saves and the fact of the matter is its not 2004 anymore its not 2004 and its 2007 and i think you have to live in the present and you cant live by big names you cant live in the past it doesnt matter what somebody did in an olympic gold medal game in the olympics three years ago now is what matters and thats what i think

7099812 it began in autumn of 1888 during a series of brutal slayings
7099813 holmes began authoring a series of folios sets of instructions on a variety of topics that people would need to be well versed in should they choose to take up holmess mission
7099814 forensics disguise interrogation ballistics any topic he could think of
7099815 holmes took up a pen name the beekeeper and sent his teachings out into the world as if they were his own children that he hoped would grow and prosper
7099816 speaking of children i wasnt aware that he had any
7099817 did holmes live long enough to see the beekeepers guild form
7099818 it is clich now to refer to moriarty as holmes did the napoleon of crime but there may be no other way to put it
7099819 aside from his criminal intellect moriarty possessed a truly superior academic mind by an early age hed authored studies on binomial theorem and dynamics of asteroids to all appearances james moriarty should have gone on to cure a great disease or discover a new solar system instead he set events in motion that would create a network of criminals so vast that it would eventually change the face of the world
7099820 i think you might be getting a little carried away emily i happen to have some knowledge of large criminal organizations at work in the world and ive never heard of this man
7099821 in 1882 a group called the irish national invincibles assassinated the british chief secretary to ireland and his secretary
7099822 in the late 1800s the term mafia first appeared in official law documentation when a sicilian doctor was threatened for not abandoning his lemon grove
7099823 i could go on mr bond but one startling fact remains in the early 1880s multiple criminal organizations sprang up that grew very powerful very quickly
7099824 and you believe this professor moriarty was at the head of it all
7099825 but his methods his influence it is seen and felt throughout that time moriarty was the spider spinning a massive web of chaos that reached across nations
7099826 that would be much too simple so what ever became of professor moriarty

7099907 in selecting sen joe biden as his running mate sen obama has chosen a proven and effective advocate for fairness and equality that our entire community can be proud of
7099908 sen bidens record in the united states senate is one of support and understanding that has been unwavering throughout his career
7099909 we only need to look back to the recent passage of the repeal of the hiv travel and immigration ban to see the type of leadership we can expect from sen biden on the issues important to our community
7099910 it was because of his determination and tenacity that we were able to see this relic of discrimination against people living with hiv aids torn down
7099911 if the support sen biden has proven on our issues is any indication of the type of vice president he will be than our community can be assured that sen obama has chosen a thoughtful and staunch advocate for equality as his closest adviser

7099915 this is a very relevant discussion right now weve got this wave of new lunar missions from around the world
7099916 how do you get activity going if the moon is owned by everyone at the same time
7099917 im happy to deed over half of my acre to a common acre pool i see this as a way of reconciling a right of individual ownership and the idea that the moon belongs to the whole earth
7099918 its much easier to solve this problem by thinking it through and thinking through what would most benefit the best interest of humanity rather than doing it once its a mess
7099919 in conclusion who owns on the moon no one who should own the moon no one does this stop property rights no the best way forward is probably some sort of property licensing body like how it works in geo
7099920 we needed some way for people to access the trails and to orient them on where the trails are
7099921 this is a good place to do it without disturbing the environment

7099928 this definitely is an ongoing concern its not something that were all just gonna chuck away again
7099929 looking back i dont think we had to be so blunt and alright were splitting up really we shouldve just chilled out for a bit and taken some time out to be honest
7099930 but obviously we all had a deep yearning inside to get back to do this or it wouldnt have happened i just hope we dont split up again now cause it becomes a bit silly doesnt it
7099931 its gonna be towards the end of this year or the beginning of the new one
7099932 we did six dates earlier this year and it wasnt enough i want to visit all those places weve been where we know weve got fans and breathe life into these new songs from forth thats definitely on our list of things to do
7099933 i dont think us being back together means we have to do a record every year
7099934 well do it on our own terms and at our own pace but definitely all of us want to pursue this its something that means a lot to all of us its a bit of a shock to be doing it again but a very nice shock really

7099938 in my view they wont do aggressive counterinsurgency because they cant
7099939 this means they are less likely to cooperate not more
7099940 right now they care about whats in their own institutions interests

7099947 we came to help the palestinian people in gaza to lift the siege
7099948 they wanted provocation at sea but they wont get it we know who the passengers are and what they are bringing with them and so we have no problem letting them through
7099949 strong message to the arab people and to arab leaders
7099950 a first step for the international community to end the suffering of the palestinian people in gaza
7099951 while we should never forget the atrocities committed in the past we should be equally vigilant in seeking to abolish the contemporary forms of slavery that affect millions of men women and children around the world
7099952 weve entered gazan waters were flying the palestinian flag and we now believe that were going to reach the shores of gaza very soon i missed the start of the berlin wall coming down by just a few days but now i know how people felt when
7099953 we call for more activities to break the unfair siege imposed on our people
7099954 we were throwing out the idea of a new kind of ranking system with the first set in may we were doing a test run
7099955 after seeing the response forbes decided they wanted to come out with a full fledged ranking for august because thats when most college rankings come out
7099956 they dont pick one private school and one public school this is one way our rankings are different from others
7099957 at forbes we believe very strongly in competition the college ranking game has been monopolized by u s news amp world report for a long time
7099958 we want people to get as much information and be as informed as they can before they make these decisions and we hope these rankings provide an alternative point of view to those by u s news
7099959 research shows that ratemyprofessor evaluations highly correlate with student evaluations at schools
7099960 we used this because the web site acts as an independent third party source for evaluations with little influence or chance of bias from the schools themselves
7099961 its not perfect but there also isnt any other comprehensive source that measures alumni success there are cases where people have fabricated their own biographical information but i would argue those cases arent statistically significant
7099962 if schools didnt have awards it didnt necessarily hurt their score but it didnt improve it either
7099963 there is no such thing as the best college or university in a general sense
7099964 but there is a best college or university for each individual student
7099965 the rankings were important to me because i want to have a credible university on my resume when i apply for jobs
7099966 but i believe that it was probably more important for my parents when deciding on where to send me
7099967 college rankings are important but theyre not the only major thing just because a college has a good ranking doesnt mean that it will be the right fit for someone
