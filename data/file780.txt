7800023 we are putting in place an integrated national knowledge network that would have nodes to all major institutions of higher education and learning
7800024 this network would help our institutions of higher learning to connect with each other and carry on the relevant interdisciplinary dialogue
7800025 collaboration and co creation are becoming the hallmark of higher education today in an increasingly democratizing and globalised world
7800026 academic resources can then flow from institutions like iits iims national research institutions and universities into each other enriching every participating institution
7800027 the first phase of the network will become functional before the end of this year and this iit at guwahati will be part of it

7800029 literature in many arab countries suffers from the weak relationships between generations there is no loyalty to the former writers and their literature yemen is still far away from such a thing writers of the present like the former writers respect their works
7800030 if writers of this time respect the former writers before them they writers of today will be respected by the coming generations
7800031 those who wonder why there is such trouble in the arab countries they do not realize the real reason behind it is loyalty that many people do not appreciate the absence of loyalty between generations is the real reason behind the disconnected between generations
7800032 we have not felt his absence he is still in our minds as if he was still alive and his body moved around us
7800033 he is a great poet that will never die in our memory he is the poet of past present and future he reached this position by his hard work to overcome the pain and difficulties that he faced by saying pain we do not mean physical pain but pain related to his literature and creativity
7800034 to reach this position al baradoni paid greatly and lost many things to reach his goal no one can achieve what he wants without losing many precious things
7800035 for creative people death means a new life because he will be more famous after his death and many people will start looking for his good work this great poet will never die he will stay in peoples memories until the last breath of the last person in this life
7800036 he cared more about improving the arabic poetry so that his works became special and noted his impact is not only confined to his poems and lectures but to peoples lives many yemeni poets have learned a lot from his experience they learned how to be patient enduring and loyal to their lovely country

7800066 uns freut ganz besonders wie gut die sterreichischen h ndlerpr senzen angenommen werden
7800067 wesentlicher bestandteil dieses erfolges ist die weit ber den erwartungen liegende reichweite die durch das erste gartenwiki gardora bereits in dieser gartensaison erzielt werden konnte wir hatten 10 ooo besuche pro monat zwischen m rz und juli geplant lagen dann aber tats chlich bei knapp ber 20 ooo besuchen pro monat also bei ber 2oo prozent wir sind u erst gespannt wie das jahr 2009 verlaufen wird

7800077 this curriculum respects a students right to choose whether or not to sign an organ donor card

7800082 we want to explode a number of the myths about organ donation that its against certain religions or that it interferes with funeral preparations or that doctors wont work as hard to save you if youve signed a donor card

7800093 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream

7800110 many lawyers ive spoken to now view the invitation of content so if you have a comments section at the end of an article on a newspaper site they view that as inviting comment and therefore you are responsible for it and therefore you probably want to consider pre moderating all the content that goes there
7800111 i think that does get talked about a lot but i think the justice eady case might change that slightly
7800112 im not sure if theres enough case law yet to have a hard and fast rule on that in terms of what is said online
7800113 bulletin board posts are rather like contributions to a casual conversation the analogy sometimes being drawn with people chatting in a bar which people simply note before moving on they are often uninhibited casual and ill thought out
7800114 when considered in the context of defamation law therefore communications of this kind are much more akin to slanders this cause of action being nowadays relatively rare than to the usual more permanent kind of communications found in libel actions
7800115 it is likely that the courts will focus on whether or not a publisher reviewed content rather than the form of the publication
7800116 it isnt likely to make any difference whether or not it is an invitation to comment or a bulletin board they amount to much the same thing if the comments are not moderated the publisher is probably safe at least until notified of any allegedly defamatory posting

7800157 it is as if sportsmen and women have a higher base level of sexual energy but why can it be that one of the underlying drivers of sporting greatness is also the very thing that produces an overactive sex drive
7800158 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened
7800159 i definitely admire him for his athletic ability and everything hes achieved
7800160 im just really glad to be in the mix with that
7800161 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
7800162 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
7800163 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
7800164 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
7800165 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
7800166 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in
7800167 eww thats nasty i have never ever hooked up with michael phelps
7800168 come on i have really good taste hes really not my type we dont even talk to each other
7800169 im not dating amanda beard i think she has a boyfriend
7800170 part of my life is kept to myself im able to relax and be with my friends those pretty much are the only people who really know the answer to that
7800171 its just experience shes been in the olympics before shes been in world championships shes jumped a decade longer than me so its just a matter of time
7800172 i just wanted to prove who is the best at the olympic games
7800173 i really dont want other caregivers to go through my situation because its been very tough
7800174 i dream of a society that gives value and concern to its people who create its wealth

7800177 we feel very strongly that if you are good enough to work in canada you are good enough to apply for landed immigration
7800178 they take care of canadian children working families would not survive without them they raise our kids for me this is priceless
7800179 they deserve our respect and appreciation some have left their own kids behind
7800180 its sad ive been taking care of somebodys child but i dont have any of my own
7800181 i got a lot i cant complain everything i got it is just that after that gold i was not able to give my country another medal because of wrist injury or i would have got even more but i got enough
7800182 it is still utterly deceptive because the irrational appeal of proximity to the jackpot motivates the consumer far more than an expressed intent to support the activity advertised

7800344 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7800345 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

7800389 i think we essentially got what we hoped for a slow saturating rain
7800390 no one likes to see the flooding but weve had such dry conditions that the ground cant absorb the water quick enough
7800391 the drought has raised awareness about the limitations of our water resources
7800392 people are recognizing that if we dont manage our water resources as efficiently as possible the increasing demand and competition for resources will create a man made drought
7800393 the drought is going to still affect us even if the rain continues
7800394 the lake levels have been down in some of our reservoirs from where they should be for this time of year
7800395 oftentimes people think that if we get 8 to 10 inches of rain everything will be ok but it does take some time to get those levels back up
7800396 who is this motherfer you best be not calling long distance
7800397 when you put photovoltaic panels on top of a carport structure it becomes like a living thing
7800398 its not an inanimate object it generates electricity by being exposed to the sun so it comes down into the utility grid and produces electricity
7800399 we looked at proportions use of materials line and texture
7800400 its no longer seen as a fad or a trend
7800401 i feel like i am retired now because im doing exactly what i want to do

7800403 architectural excellence and advanced technology appropriate for future generations were part of the solar grove vision from the very beginning along with kyocera we have reached for something greater for society something beautiful meaningful and of extraordinary practical value
7800404 this enterprise is an example of the solar industry stepping into an exciting new phase by providing a visually pleasing architectural improvement to the community coupled with environmentally sound energy production
7800405 synergies between kyocera and envision solar will transform the way in which solar electric products are utilized and deployed
7800406 the business model is to provide turn key single point of contact services to the property owners
7800407 there are very few companies that have the capability of doing all of that and envision solar is the only company that we can find worldwide whose primary business is this turnkey solution
7800408 for all property owners to have a renewable energy installation there is such a large learning curve even for owners in the business
7800409 the integration of the site plan the system buildings and the photovoltaic systems and all of the electrical mechanical design all of this to be coordinated through design entitlement with a planning authority then engineered then brought to the site fabricated installed on the structures then set into operation and maintained
7800410 the subsidy program is the driver behind the launch of this company
7800411 the technology for solar power is there but the cost needs to come down
7800412 theres a lot of parking space out there in the world
7800413 and businesses can use financial advantages like depreciation and amortization on top of the tax credits and rebates to make this a real financial benefit businesses and municipalities are particularly aware that the cost for power can only increase over time so controlling that cost is a very real benefit to them
7800414 we already have a business that does commercial and residential work and we do add a carport here and there
7800415 with the photovoltaic expertise of kyocera and the architectural and engineering expertise that bob noble brings envision has designed a really efficient and practical product that can be used easily
7800416 we embraced the concept and developed a design for the solar tree with kyocera
7800417 the tree is a metaphor but appropriate in that it has a column branches and a tap root really the foundation and then the canopy instead of a canopy of leaves its the photovoltaic panels which produce electrical energy we consider it a living structure
7800418 we incorporated environmental design elements in the project like bioswales landscaped areas that collect rainwater the water travels through the swales and it helps purify the water before it goes into the storm drain system
7800419 all you need to do is fly over commercial and industrial areas anywhere in the world and youll see the parking lots are the opportunity
7800420 thats where the sun is rooftops are too small building rooftops have mechanical systems elevator overruns stairs vents a variety of obstructions that often interfere the other thing is roof penetrations you dont want to penetrate your waterproof membrane so in many cases the opportunity is much greater in the parking lots
7800421 the peak of need for electricity is around 4 p m on weekdays 100 hours a year create 16 percent of the power generators peak demand
7800422 if we can supply that electricity when the sun is burning brightest well need no more power plants
7800423 we have a pretty extensive list of candidate projects owners of parking lots who wish to have solar groves and they include private commercial developers in los angeles and public agencies in southern and northern california
7800424 we have designs for covering four cars we are developing a residential design that will cover either one or two cars and any multiple larger than that
7800425 its easier than putting solar panels on your roof the way were developing it is as a do it yourself kit the homeowner can put in the footings very simply and erect the envision port themselves we get asked daily do you have an envision solar carport for my house when you get asked daily you try to satisfy demand
7800426 we know the market will be at least 10 times what it is today the only thing thats not certain is how fast the curve will grow
7800427 there are periodic shortages of raw silicon we compete with the semiconductor industry for that supply and theres a shortage now as solar power moves from the niche market into the mainstream i expect that will change

7800456 this is a good price given consideration for the current softening in oil prices the turbulence on global stock markets and the geopolitical stage
7800457 while the equity markets are currently focused on downside risks we believe there are potential offsets on the upside based on continued strength in commodity demand low inventory levels and a supply side which continues to face multiple constraints
7800458 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlook remains positive
7800459 whilst the results were good it appears they werent good enough to drive the share price to perform materially differently from the rest of the sector

7800470 i dont normally ride on the flat in fact thats only the second winner i have had the other one was for ger lyons
7800471 as regards this race my horse travelled well throughout and as soon as we came to the final hill the rest of the field came back to me after that it was a matter of persevering and just getting up
7800472 hes an improving sort and you can take it from me that ruby and i are hard to beat at downpatrick
7800473 my only other win in ireland was at tramore and im delighted
7800474 this has been good for me appeal denied will probably go hurdling next but ive always had luck at downpatrick although this was my first winner here
7800475 he was a great ulsterman and a great irishman a man of rare energy truly original a man who was part of a whole generation of original spirits
7800476 he was one of the transformers in irish life as an artist in his contribution as a singer and performer but also in his contribution as a broadcaster and educator and mentor he added to the quality of life
7800477 was a joy to be with and to work with a wonderful personality and an extremely talented man
7800478 tomorrow when i am back at the club i will discuss these things it is important to be focused before a game last week we only talked about wigan but tomorrow i will talk about players tomorrow when i come into the club i will discuss this or that who comes who goes first we finished the game now we get back to london and i start a new week
7800479 if deco is scoring goals or if lampard is scoring goals is not important what is important is if chelsea win
7800480 chelsea is more important than us they are friends and if one scores the other players are happy i read that lampard in the last two or three seasons has scored 20 goals every year this season maybe 25 but maybe 15 or 10 maybe even five it is not important if chelsea win
7800481 when you play the top teams you have to have people ready and willing to do their jobs and run a million miles
7800482 my midfield four ran themselves to a standstill you have to do that you have to physically work harder than they do but we just lacked that little bit of quality the set piece delivery just wasnt there
7800483 it was terrible and that is the one disappointment in pre season daniel de ridder jason koumas olivier kapo have all delivered and our set pieces are usually good but here they were appalling and it didnt matter who took them because they all had a go you need good dead ball specialists and we have some good ones but they were a huge disappointment
7800484 who is that lad by the way where has he been playing for the last couple of years seriously though he oozes class and that is why he is at the very highest level chelsea had a bad day but there was one bit of brilliance from deco
7800485 the mum just woke with the actual sound of the flames and the smell of the heavy smoke
7800486 when these things get thrown at you you actually try that much harder
7800487 he thaksin is even more adamant now because this is his love and he wants to show people he is really committed i asked the question as well as everyone else is the club for sale and he is quite adamant this club is not for sale and he is here for the long haul
7800488 i asked why did you buy it he said he bought it because there is a 10 year plan
7800489 this was a big win for us irrespective of the fact west ham went down to 10 men mark noble was sent off so early i felt we were in control
7800490 there was a real determination in our play and a willingness to ask questions of the opposition it was a good all round performance and once we got our noses in front there was only going to be one winner
7800491 i knew he was a good player and you saw that as well you always hope that when you introduce someone who hasnt plied their trade in the premier league they will make an instant impact vincent has presence an understanding of the game and he recognises danger when those situations occur he nips these things in the bud he has the flexibility i like in players and the ability to play in a number of positions his performance was key to our victory
7800492 i was extremely flattered when they approached me about becoming the face of the campaign for the new product launch
7800493 i jumped at the chance and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience of modelling so far i intend to put in 100
7800494 la is my home now because all my family are in the states
7800495 i spoke to tony adams at the game and i said to him where is the leadership coming from in this team its certainly not coming from william gallas the captain
7800496 its been quite active over the years but this is the biggest we have experienced for a few years
7800497 its been quite active over the years but this is the biggest we have experienced for a few years
7800498 the screen plainly separates them from the jury and everybody else in the courtroom
7800499 the little boy that would stare into your eyes and laugh when you played with him turned into a boy that wouldnt even respond when you called his name
7800500 i think people have a hard time separating out whats reliable information and whats not reliable
7800501 what gets attention is not the statistics but the story
7800502 the number of people who are trying to make changes in the vaccination schedule based on what they have heard or seen or read on the internet is climbing every year
7800503 even those who ultimately decide not to alter the schedule have questions about it and every year we spend more time talking about immunizations with parents
7800504 it is important for people to protect themselves as well as others who come in contact with them
7800505 as long as there are pockets in the community that remain unvaccinated that certainly increases the risk of ongoing transmission of measles in the community
7800506 the childhood vaccination schedule shouldnt be a one size fits all because every child is different
7800507 your brother has never lost his temper on me and has always been a very fillial son why must he be punished this way
7800508 vroeger waren de kroketten iets te vast vanbinnen en knack vond dat ze iets smeu iger mochten zijn
7800509 as an atheist my argument against god was that the universe seemed to cruel and unjust but how had i gotten this idea of just and unjust a man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line what was i comparing this universe to when i called it unjust if the whole show was bad and senseless from a to z so to speak why did i who was supposed to be a part of the show find myself in such violent reaction to it of course i could have given up my idea of justice by saying that it was nothing but a private idea of my own but if i did that then my argument against god collapsed too for the argument depended on saying that the world was really unjust not simply that it did not happen to please my fancies
7800510 god doesnt exist because if he did he would not have suffering in this world
7800511 i see no reason for attributing to man a significant difference in kind that which belongs to a baboon or a grain of sand
7800512 all stories will come to nothing all life will turn out in the end to have been a transitory and senseless contortion upon the idiotic face of matter
7800513 look you need to understand that without god or a higher power there is no such thing as justice if it is by mans standards it is completely arbitrary and there is no ultimate judgement
7800514 you need to read about the other side of the debate theism before you go around facebook and argue with them
7800515 on being certain believing you are right even when you are not

7800536 our performance in li ge was poor but the result was good we did not concede an away goal and we hope that playing the second leg at anfield will make a massive difference
7800537 the entire team did not play well they li ge were organised pressed well and were very aggressive
7800538 football is about winning it does not matter how well you play so long as you come off the pitch having picked up the points
7800539 when you do not play as well as you know you can but you are still getting results then that is a sign of a good team we have got two wins out of two in the league and that is all you can ask for now we will look ahead to the champions league game against li ge and we know how important it is to make sure we get into the group stages i am looking forward to being able to play here on a european night
7800540 we did not play well in li ge and we know we will have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage it would be unthinkable for us not to be in the champions league as players we expect to be there and so do the fans we know all the pressure is on us

7800565 fred solomon is one of a kind in his knowledge and integrity than any one i have ever seen in the real estate arena it is no wonder his workshops are full with eager people such as myself who want correct honest answers and guidance i recommend his workshops to anyone not wanting the run around but to tell it like it is you will walk away with knowledge that can help you the rest of your life if you ever thought of owning a home or want to learn the right ways to invest and save or make money

7800591 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7800592 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7800593 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7800594 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7800613 there was a really small part of me that was worried about how i would be accepted in the show because of the modelling work
7800614 but im not some kind of party girl im more of a nerd because im really focused on the work and when i started in modelling it was really by accident because im very petite at 5ft 2in and very shy so i was really surprised to be asked
7800615 but i have loved being on neighbours because the cast are really great and have given me such a warm welcome
7800616 i am such a nerd because youll see me in the green room making notes and reading all the scripts even if im not in that scene because i want to learn so much about it all
7800617 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time

7800628 ci sono altre forme di vita intelligenti sparse per la galassia anche se le pi vicine sono probabilmente a molte galassie di distanza
7800629 we havent been playing unbelievably in the last two games
7800630 but as long as youre winning games thats the most important thing the flowing football will follow
7800631 a few times we linked up against middlesbrough and we played each other in so theres definitely signs there
7800632 it would have been nice if we had of scored but i think it doesnt matter with strikers as long as the team is winning that is the most important thing
7800633 our display this time will be much much better of that i am confident
7800634 our performance in liege was poor but the result was good we did not concede an away goal and we hope that playing the second leg at anfield will make a massive difference
7800635 the entire team did not play well they liege were organised pressed well and were very aggressive
7800636 i am very happy with the result but i am not happy with the performance of the team the last three games we have not played well but we were playing really well during pre season
7800637 if we can bring in new faces then the competition will be better for me and we can improve the main thing for me is the mentality of the players we were trying until the end we were going forward working really hard with determination and that is important
7800638 i will try and find a positive message from these kind of games and it is that we won without playing well last season we played well in a lot of games but never scored the goals from the chances we had
7800639 now we have six points out of six points and when everyone is ready we will play much better and it will be difficult to stop us
7800640 we had a lot of offensive players on the pitch but if you had said to me we would draw then maybe i would have said yes because we had conceded late
7800641 it is always difficult to score two goals in that length of time
7800642 i want to play well but if you dont play well and win then the confidence of the team will stay high it is impossible to play well all the time so you need to keep going
7800643 you have to give credit to middlesbrough they were pretty good and well organised
7800644 they had good players in front and could play good football
7800645 they had players in the wide areas who were good they worked really hard in defence
7800646 i thought he was pretty good the understanding with torres was much better he worked hard with good movements the key is the rest of the team giving them good passes
7800647 that is the reason why nabil was a key player for us
7800648 i was saying to him stay wide stay wide and he offered the wide areas
7800649 dossena was going forward in the first half and arbeloa in the second half but really our wingers are not players who play on the lines
7800650 we have to try through our full backs and keep the other team back
7800651 i think it is important to keep the balance we will try and do our best
7800652 liverpool were starting to get frustrated and there were long balls that were running out of play
7800653 i couldnt ask more from the lads and again when they look back they will realise how close they came to getting a result
7800654 liverpool have the ability to keep going resilience and they have players who can pop up and score important goals as gerrard and torres have done in the last two weeks
7800655 they are what they are we didnt have any fear but we couldnt get the win we wanted
7800656 we have received two interesting offers both of which are from english clubs
7800657 what we always do is defend our interests we wont sell any player if the bid is not the amount we have asked for
7800658 if they want albert riera theyll have to pay what espanyol is asking
7800659 there is a team which is offering what we have asked and another one which isnt but the player is interested in the one which is offering the least
7800660 we know we havent been playing unbelievably well in our first two games but as long as youre winning games thats what really matters and im sure the flowing football will follow
7800661 its important that you get off to a good start in the premiership because it is such a competitive league and weve managed to do that
7800662 you have to remember weve only played the first two games of the season and what you have to do at this stage is get points on the board im sure the good football will follow
7800663 we have received two interesting offers both of which are from english clubs
7800664 what we always do is defend our interests we wont sell any player if the bid is not the amount we have asked for
7800665 if they want albert riera theyll have to pay what espanyol is asking
7800666 while luis garcias possible transfer to benfica has stalled this one could be in its final hours
7800667 if someone does leave within the next 24 hours they will be replaced
7800668 there is a team which is offering what we have asked and another one which isnt but the player is interested in the one which is offering the least
7800669 dic are not interested in getting involved in man city their interest is only in liverpool football club
7800670 yes i think we were worthy winners tonight i think we played some excellent football
7800671 historically it fratton park is a difficult place to come last year we drew here the year before we lost
7800672 when he didnt turn up at the weekend everybody was saying it was because he doesnt want to play on the turf but that wasnt the case
7800673 the good news is that he is flying in tonight and then he can see the stadium and the facilities and have a look at the turf
7800674 they tell me he is one of the best finishers in the league so that excites me
7800675 ive heard he is a good guy in the locker room and that hes a good character what im not going to do is start a war with him you cant do that with certain players some players need a cuddle to get the best out of them and you have to get in the faces of others this is a guy who you have to show respect to he can be a hero here

7800727 the beauty of this and the adjustment of the fees is that everybody who is eligible gets a place theres none of this where some people pay 877 and other people pay 8 000 a year for full private cost recovery

7800729 some fees will stay the same and others will rise in line with the expected job opportunities and wage outcomes from engaging in one of those qualifications
7800730 the australian high commissioner in nairobi is working closely with the senior members of the somali government to seek mr brennans release
7800731 the somali government has informed us they are using every channel to persuade the kidnappers to release the hostage unconditionally
7800732 we are also in contact with foreign governments with interests in somalia and un agencies in somalia to seek their cooperation and assistance
7800733 we dont know who kidnapped them there is a rebel group which kidnaps for ransom separate from rivals who have political objectives

7800738 the blame game and the cost shifting between different levels of government along with wasteful duplication of resources and the wide range of border anomalies we encounter make me at least open to considering a better way of governing australia

7800756 its no more important than the four games we have in chicago after every game is the playoffs right now
7800757 he was patient he had short quick swings and stayed on the ball
7800758 you have to have that feeling of how to pitch
7800759 you draw it up and the law of averages says youre going to score some runs but you cant depend on that
7800760 hes throwing some filthy stuff up there right now i mean absolutely filthy

7800767 so in everything do to others what you would have them do to you for this sums up the law and the prophets
7800768 just as you want others to do for you do the same for them
7800769 well be looking to make one or two changes for the game not in terms of weakening the team because weve got a lot of guys who arent starting games who could be considered first team players
7800770 its a smashing game for us against a top 10 side in the championship
7800771 its a fantastic experience for our team and its a great opportunity for them to prove that they can handle their own against a team who have spent heavily and will hope to be in the promotion mix come the end of the season
7800772 i was pleased with it it was a reasonable point at a ground that is not an easy place to play
7800773 bowlesy was the most talented footballer i ever played with
7800774 emmanuel is a very good player its wonderful to watch him he makes your eyes open wide with some of his tricks but he can also do the simple things well
7800775 he played his position very well he played a bit off the cuff last week but he has responded with a very disciplined display and he makes the ball talk
7800776 daniel has got everything in his locker for one so young he has got great talent and hes also learning about the physicality of the game
7800777 they are good lads weve finished the game with five under 20s on the pitch there arent many teams who do that but we have to give them time to develop
7800778 they are not going to become superstars overnight because daniel is from where he is from everyone expects him to be a superstar but he is improving and emmanuels discipline was miles better than in his first game
7800779 the attitude application and desire of the players to embrace what we are trying to do has been terrific
7800780 doncaster are a very good side one of the best passing sides in the division and we nullified that and we had a creativity
7800781 we were first to everything the defeat at sheffield united hurt and we spoke openly and brutally about that in the week and put it to bed the response was a clean sheet today
7800782 they learned from that defeat at sheffield united and were much more solid today they made it difficult for us
7800783 eight of their players are over 6ft 2ins so its not rocket science to say you have to defend properly at set plays so were disappointed with that
7800784 its the first physical test we have faced in this division and we struggled to find a way to get a result goal com
7800785 hes got a suspected fracture of the jaw so he was taken to hospital for an x ray
7800786 hopefully the results will show that it was only suspected and he can get a clean bill of health he took a nasty knock and we were worried that it may have been something more serious than a bang to the chin
7800787 once we had given the goal away so early from the set play they are the team with the personnel of which the majority is over 62 we knew that defending from set plays was going to be crucial to give the goal away like that it was disappointing
7800788 i thought we rallied and we had enough possession to cause them problems but didnt really cause them that many problems you have to give credit to the home side they bounced back from a bad result against sheffield united and i think that they were probably a bit more determined and organised
7800789 we found it difficult to break them down we couldnt launch long balls into the box because their superior physical strength which would mean we couldnt score cleanly we tried to maneuver the ball and credit to them they worked hard to stop us doing that
7800790 the first goal changed the game i think when you score early doors especially at home its a massive advantage i though that the lads stuck in though and we played some good football at times but there was no end product today
7800791 i think that this was the biggest test for us so far this season we are only three games in but we knew that this lot had spent a lot of money and are tipped to do well and today showed why they have a lot of quality up front and they did very well
7800792 they changed their shape to go three in the midfield to match our three which we didnt expect they did their homework and identified our strengths and tried to nullify them and it worked for them i totally think that the early goal totally changed the game doncaster eurosport view from the terraces qpr our man at loftus road gives his verdict on how the new championship season is shaping up for queens park rangers after another home win at the weekend what are your expectations for the season mid table our strikers do not have enough goals in them to reach the play offs we should beat teams like barnsley and doncaster at home with little trouble you saw what happened when we had a real test against sheffield united qpr lost 3 0 and weve conceded six goals in four games including the league cup this season which member of the team would you drop in a second kaspars gorkss it was his fault that barnsley scored at the start of the season and apparently he had a mare at bramall lane his positioning is poor and he doesnt seem up to it well have to drop one of the midfielders to get martin rowlands back in maybe daniel parejo who would you like the hoops to sign a striker definitely an out and out goalscorer id have liked kevin phillips but i dont know if that was realistic weve got the players to make the goals but forwards like patrick agyemang and dexter blackstock although that boy works very hard arent going to get you 20 to 25 goals maybe a freddy eastwood or robert earnshaw type player who are your main men martin rowlands pictured he works hard is great at passing and as our captain is a real leader on the pitch he is not the biggest but he has got so much intelligence hes been suspended for the first three games akos buzsaky was our other star last year and when he gets fit he could be key again emmanuel ledesma is a good football player but im not sure if hes strong enough he might not like visiting places like blackpool lee cook can be a big player again we sold him for big money so hes obviously very good but hes got to get fit first after he didnt play much last season which club do you really dislike i dont dislike anyone a typical qpr hatred is brentford and luton but i feel sorry for them because theyre rubbish its harsh to dock anyone 30 points and chelsea is another one our fans dont like although we might end up a bit like them with the new owners

7800807 is that it violates a lot of classic principles yet it succeeds in delivering the necessary functions in a contextual and compact way
7800808 when the user mouses over a book a contextual popup comes up containing information about the book and a set of associated actions part of the popup is a button menu sort of like a button and combo box widget that allows the user to provide information about what he or she did with the book the first thing to note is that combination of a button in a menu is not standard yet it makes sense because it saves a click for the most important action secondly the menu is effectively a popup within a popup which is a big no no in the classic world but works well in this context the elements of the menu are not buttons but check boxes which allow multiple selection another violation of classic user interface elements but which works very well in this context what is remarkable is how intuitive this gadget is you are interacting with it in the context of a book and each choice is simple and clear such clarity and simplicity was never present in the old interfaces clearly this new approach to uis is great and early adopters are loving it but will it cross over to the mainstream

7800818 er zijn echt wel bands die een optreden moeten afzeggen omdat ze te veel hebben gefeest maar dat is vooral stom en lullig voor de fans
7800819 normaal gesproken beginnen we ook pas met feesten na het optreden
7800820 dan gaat het ook echt alleen om de muziek geen fancy artwork geen doosjes of andere afleidingen
7800821 het mooie aan een download is dat je het direct aan de fans kan geven vanaf het moment dat de opnamen en alles daaromheen klaar is kunnen we het gelijk aan iedereen laten horen
7800822 normaal gesproken sturen we het product wel eens door aan iemand om er van te kunnen proeven nu sturen we het gewoon naar iedereen prachtig toch
7800823 dit album omvat alles wat we als band willen doen het is echt het beste wat we te bieden hebben
7800824 ik zie onze band wel als een kruising tussen massive attack en de beatles met de meeste nadruk op massive attack
7800825 we hebben altijd veel gerotzooid met remixen soundscapes en texturen
7800826 daarom hebben we deze plaat ook zo in elkaar gezet dat het einde precies aansluit op het begin je kunt de cd gewoon rond laten draaien en ondertussen wat roken of met je liefje vrijen zo moet je naar de dandy warhols luisteren

7800836 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7800837 the carnival is the perfect london spectacle to captivate the world with its dazzling array of costumes and music

7800846 the work done by the bella moss foundation is exactly what vets and pet owners have needed the foundation has made the profession sit up and take notice of mrsa when it probably didnt want to and its fantastic that it now has charity status vets and owners have to work together with the same information to make sure that pets have the very best of care as a profession we have to be more focused on the best way to deal with mrsa and other serious infections and jill and the bella moss foundation is helping us do just that
7800847 i am delighted to hear that the valuable work done in the area of infectious diseases in animals can now move on to the next phase due to the bella moss foundations new status as a charity the extent of mrsa and other diseases in dogs is not really known only the fact that the numbers are rising vets will welcome the support and information provided by the charity i can see nothing but good coming from this
7800848 being at events like this is vital to the work of the foundation and we want to thank the kennel club for all of the help its given us we know that there are many people who are still unaware of the things they can do to protect their pets and this is the best way of reaching them im still amazed by the number of people who have no idea that pets can be affected by serious infections like mrsa people take our leaflets and thank us for raising awareness we advise pet owners on how to keep their pets healthy what they can do to help limit post operative infections occurring and advise them on communicating with their vets to ensure the best health care for their animals we also advise human doctors and nurses on cross infection and patients who have mrsa infections on hygiene in the home and around their pets
7800849 i have been helping the foundation for two years now and i really enjoy meeting the public and having a chance to talk to them the foundation works hard to keep owners informed of not just symptoms of post operative infections but also prevention i am delighted to be of help and as i move through my training as a vet i hope to become more involved with academic projects that the foundation is working on with leading veterinary schools
7800850 but we know that more needs to be offered as well as large events the bella moss foundation in association with janssen animal health are planning another series of cpd seminars on mrsa in animals around the country may 2008 these seminars will bring leading researchers and clinicians with the most up to date knowledge to those front line vets unable to make it to the conference these programmes show our commitment to working in partnership with the profession

7800880 don juan carlos tiene gran aureola pero yo nunca le aceptar como rey
7800881 una inspecci n previa en los d as o semanas anteriores a la cat strofe podr a haber detectado alguno de esos fallos
7800882 porque los escasos medios humanos y las presiones de las compa as propician que las inspecciones sean en numerosas ocasiones superficiales e insuficientes
7800883 las dos responsabilidades principales que recaen sobre las administraciones p blicas y sus departamentos y agencias competentes son por un lado ofrecer una explicaci n t cnica del accidente y por otro lado dar a los ciudadanos suficientes garant as de que el transporte cuenta con una estructura adecuada de procedimientos de inspecci n control y sanci n
7800884 se demuestra no s lo exhibiendo las que anta o eran buenas cifras de crecimiento sino tambi n modernizando las estructuras de servicios a los ciudadanos
7800885 la verdad lisa y llana es que no hay motivos objetivos para creer que la seguridad a rea es ahora m s precaria que antes del d a 20 las compa as que operan en espa a son las m s fiables del mundo y los controles a los que son sometidas de manera peri dica y sistem tica ofrecen garant as suficientes
7800886 es necesario por tanto que vuelva la calma a los aeropuertos y que se restablezca el buen sentido
7800887 si el accidente era evitable o no acotar las eventuales responsabilidades y discernir si existen fallas en las revisiones y el mantenimiento de los aviones que parten de los aeropuertos espa oles

7800889 la exigencia de explicaciones pero no es l gico sembrar por adelantado la sospecha ante cualquier comportamiento o exposici n por parte de los responsables de la seguridad de la energ a nuclear
7800890 deber a esclarecer si existen problemas de gesti n de mantenimiento o de calidad de la tecnolog a empleada en unas instalaciones tan delicadas como las nucleares porque resulta preocupante que los accidentes se reiteren con tanta frecuencia
7800891 con estos mimbres ser f cil que aumente el n mero de contrarios a la energ a nuclear y queden sin argumentos sus defensores en cualquier caso no dibuja el marco m s adecuado para discutir sobre el modelo energ tico que necesita espa a para las pr ximas d cadas en el que no deber an tener cabida gestores inadecuados
7800892 dada la extrema sensibilidad social que existe respecto a la energ a nuclear es necesario garantizar la m xima informaci n y la total transparencia con respecto a los incidentes que se registran en las centrales ello es fundamental para huir de falsos alarmismos para analizar los hechos con rigor y para demostrar que los mecanismos de control operan con eficacia
7800893 la producci n de energ a nuclear ha demostrado plenamente su seguridad y los peque os incidentes registrados ltimamente en las dos centrales catalanas no justifican bajo ning n concepto cuestionar esta fuente energ tica como opci n de futuro
7800894 son ejemplos de lo que conviene ser corregido por el contrario es digna de elogio la inmediata reacci n de los gestores de vandell s poniendo en marcha todos los protocolos de seguridad establecidos la nuclear es hoy la energ a alternativa a los hidrocarburos m s fiable y aprovechar cada incidente para asociarla sin m s al concepto de inseguridad es c nico y oportunista

7801009 whether the platform will see enterprise adoption or whether it will remain plagued by people making 2 flashlights time will only tell
7801010 that wont change the fact that the capabilities provided by the iphone and the ease with which developers can tap into those capabilities is simply unprecedented this is easily reflected by the fact that from what i hear the iphone app store is selling like 1 000 000 per day of applications

7801031 they had used the wrong name on the document so i insisted that they correct the name before they could take her away i reminded them that they had to bring her home within the stipulated 12 hours
7801032 she told them that it was not illegal to take photographs in a public place and she had not visited any secret areas or military installations they had no legal basis for holding her
7801033 i cant say whether their intention was to intimidate but if they can do this to an influential writer who has done nothing more than take photographs then one can only imagine the kind of threat that ordinary people in tibet must feel every day
7801034 china was eager to present something that shows it is a new power that has its own might
7801035 it has problems but it is able to manage them it has weaknesses in its institutions but also strengths in those same institutions
7801036 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world
7801037 i believe this is something that will have positive effects for the long term
7801038 they have earned a tremendous amount of face because of the olympics
7801039 they are going to ride on that for a while we dont have a culture that is pro change china by nature has got to be provoked to make changes the economic reforms came about because we were desperately poor
7801040 for the chinese authorities to sentence them at all shows the governments insecurity and intolerance of even the most peaceful challenges to its authoritarian control
7801041 i would hope that we would look back at this as a major threshold of when china ditched all its baggage of the historical narrative of aggrieved nationalism
7801042 and just rewrote that narrative and began to act with more confidence about itself and its role in the world
7801043 i think that would make china and chinese become more tolerant and open
7801044 beijing will return to being well cloudy full of smog
7801045 with its increase of wealth china is entering a stage where it needs to have better transparency good governance and more accountability
7801046 this olympics is a good start for us to think about how china is strong and where we are weak
7801047 if the authorities say stability and harmony have returned then it has returned because whatever they say goes
7801048 a project of long term brutal repression is under way
7801049 it looks like the military is preparing to stay in the area for a long time
7801050 we were forced off the bus at gunpoint and had to register before we were put back on the bus and sent away
7801051 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7801052 they didnt want this to cast a shadow over the closing ceremonies
7801053 the challenge is to keep attention focused on the issue now that the olympic spotlight has faded
7801054 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7801055 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of 10 tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games which includes a final propaganda push to legitimize chinas rule in tibet with tibetans singing and dancing along with other so called ethnic minorities
7801056 nowadays the fire is still burning hot they dont dare do anything but we dont know what will happen

7801065 we are trying to make sure that one of us ends the summer off with a bang
7801066 i think the support structure here is the best that has ever existed in formula one
7801067 they are all devoid of ego so they are not self promoting they are about getting the drivers in the best possible shape at any one time
7801068 it demonstrated to us again how invaluable it is to have that sort of competence
7801069 we had some concerns on saturday morning he was in a lot of pain pretty sore
7801070 but you just do the common sense things on those occasions all the right things from a treatment perspective
7801071 we encourage our drivers not to sleep in air conditioning because it is not good for them at the end of the day you actually sleep better
7801072 as weve all experienced you get cold and its not a good way to look after your muscles
7801073 other than that he had muscle relaxers no sleeping pills also hydrotherapy went to bed early and he felt a lot better on sunday morning
7801074 i dont think exposing any weakness is a good thing to do
7801075 its a little like the chinese hurdler there was nothing to be gained beforehand in telling the world
7801076 when you look at what they did i have a lot of sympathy it was the right approach

7801082 if we remember there were massive protests in 2006 the house shelved the charter change proposals precisely because of the massive protest from the people its now 2008 has the sentiments of the people changed we should consult the people
7801083 is it the right time to discuss charter change if we take on the issue of charter change it will really add to the stress and tension of muslims in mindanao

7801120 i said a few weeks ago i think the fans are really going to take to him
7801121 but i think the biggest thing they will like about his performance at old trafford wasnt the long runs and the fact that he went past people and kept the ball well
7801122 it will just be the fact that it meant so much for him to play football and be in a team that wasnt going to be beaten

7801125 the results are regarded as satisfactory in view of the prevailing business climate and the turbulence in the financial markets we have seen an increase of the interest margin on loans and advances whereas fee income has been falling there have been minor shifts in the credit quality of the loan portfolio as a consequence of the economic slowdown and credit monitoring has been intensified still the quality of the loan portfolio remains high and at a comfortable level the external conditions for banking operations have deteriorated over the past year and there is no prospect of an improvement in the near future however jyske banks business is sound and offers good opportunities for the future
7801126 the beijing olympic games are a testimony to the fact that the world has its trust rested upon china
7801127 thing do you know where i can find a satellite card sharing server that is for free geo box en espa ol
7801128 this repression will be remembered as one of the defining characteristics of the beijing games
7801129 the host government has not lived up to its olympic promise that the media will be completely free to report on all aspects of china
7801130 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of ten tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games which includes a final propaganda push to legitimize chinas rule in tibet with tibetans singing and dancing along with other so called
7801131 thousands of tibetans remain missing or detained in chinas ongoing crackdown against predominantly peaceful protests that began in lhasa on march 10th and moved like a tidal wave across tibet
7801132 during the olympics tibetans have seen a vast troop build up throughout the entire tibetan plateau that suggests chinese authorities are preparing a new assault against defenseless tibetans who risked everything this spring taking to the streets to demand human rights and freedom
7801133 why are we being asked to debate this bill when we have not had time to read and prepare for the debate the time given is too short
7801134 all our preparation was for this bill i think there is an ulterior motive in speeding up the tabling the dna bill
7801135 however you can raise your points while debating the bill
7801136 but i was unwell so i asked for it to be moved down the order paper and be tabled later there is no sinister motive dont look as it as though there is one
7801137 a person is not charged because of this act but due to police investigations when they are satisfied there is a prima facie case and then it is up to the courts to decide we are not going to use this to make a person chargeable that is not the purpose of the bill
7801138 notwithstanding any written law to the contrary any information from the dna databank shall be admissible as a conclusive proof of the dna identification in any proceeding in court
7801139 if this is the case the accused would not be in a position to question the validity of the evidence or the credibility of the chemist
7801140 instead they are an obvious attempt to smear the senators character
7801141 the utter illogic of the governments position reveals what is really going on
7801142 the government wishes to smuggle in suggestions of bribery and corruption that it has not charged and cannot prove the indictment alleges no quid pro quo for any gifts sen stevens allegedly received but the government now asks permission to introduce evidence of official actions in order to invite the jury baselessly to infer just such a quid pro quo
7801143 the negative consequences flowing from such disclosure particularly during a time frame when the defendant had been engaged in performing official acts for veco and bill allen
7801144 would have subjected himself to public scrutiny and criticism regarding his ongoing relationship with veco and bill allen and the fact that he was laboring under a conflict of interest
7801145 most importantly disclosure of the things of value and the negative repercussions flowing from that disclosure would have threatened the defendants future stream of things of value from veco bill allen and others
7801146 cannot credibly claim that he cannot understand the charges or prepare his defense
7801147 where the indictment charges that stevens received things of value at the girdwood residence the indictment specifically notes that the renovation work included jacking up and resting the house on stilts building a new first floor with two bedrooms and a bathroom renovating the existing residence and adding a garage with workshop and a second story wraparound deck
7801148 each and every detail of how the case will be proved
7801149 the prosecutors who were involved in the grand jury proceedings are not aware of any evidence introduced to the grand jury that reflects an act taken by stevens such as bills or statements on the floor of the senate that would be considered protected legislative activity
7801150 it involves enforcement of an unambiguous rule contained in the criminal law do not lie when required by law to provide honest disclosure of assets
7801151 is a misguided attempt to impugn sen stevens and his family before the jury
7801152 if they know you have legal advice they will be more careful

7801292 one of our definite strengths is the depth we have
7801293 we brought in nine new freshmen girls and we only lost two sick seniors
7801294 last year we had a nice core group of fast guys but this year we have a lot more
7801295 were not going to be lacking that sixth or seventh guy
7801296 we have 12 15 deep on both sides and we only score five people so one injury is not going to kill us
7801297 weve got a lot of people fighting for those seven spots for the big meets at the end of the year competition is healthy and strong
7801298 its pretty nice to be recognized but it doesnt do anything unless you make it to the ncaa championships
7801299 being ranked definitely gave us a little more recognition and motivated us to do better and improve and make it to nationals this year

7801306 i made the decision the year before i got out that i was going to go to school full time when i got out of the military
7801307 i was going to walk on somewhere to get on a football team i made my mind up
7801308 what i did was i looked at the scenario and it wasnt a guarantee that i was going to college
7801309 i was an 18 year old kid very low income family i would need a vehicle and money to eat and the air force provided me with stability
7801310 i still remember my last game in high school the last game when we played our biggest rival
7801311 it pretty much ran through my mind that that could be the last time i would play football
7801312 my real fans know what that means tune in aug 30 just tune in aug 30
7801313 some of these guys are getting chances now they otherwise wouldnt and i think theyre all excited for it

7801319 coming in i was a defender so its like my bread and butter back there on the back line
7801320 its more of a change with the personnel having lost three of four guys but we have a lot of really talented midfielders more than weve had in our three years so we got a lot of guys to play and so they were able to move brien chammney and i back to our original positions
7801321 whether a band has a lot of personality or not theres still this raw emotion that comes through
7801322 it easily translates to photography theres nothing like having someone singing at the mic and you can just see the passion thats coming out
7801323 plus its fun listening to a band play really good music
7801324 i didnt know them until i saw them at marc savoys boucherie
7801325 i was so in awe of both of them their fiddle style was so old and so unique
7801326 it really was a history lesson it was like hearing music from pre 1900 the same way that dennis mcgee and sadie courville had all those songs
7801327 i hope that those who stumble across it and havent seen too much live cajun music get excited about it and want to go see some bands

7801546 please do not remove your shoes your feet tend to give off an aroma
7801547 ive scored 23 goals at international level and hope to raise that number to 30 soon in the last three qualifying campaigns for major tournaments i always managed to score at least five goals i will do my best to at least maintain this kind of goalscoring form
7801548 its very important to start well latvia have a lot of potential the young players have a good motivation while the veterans want to repeat their portugals experience of four years ago nothing is impossible under starkovs obviously we are not in a group of death so everything depends on us
7801549 im far from the kind of form i was in at euro 2004 but thats because of the injuries
7801550 i dont want to live on my memories i want to play and score again
7801551 im very happy with the move to celta as i understand that i dont fit into dynamos plans
7801552 i dont want to sit on the bench its very important to play regularly
7801553 i know the language and i know the country so shouldnt have any problems with adapting
7801554 we need to continue this kind of form in our next matches
7801555 we have a long season in front of us we all know a crisis will come but i hope we are up for the title this year
7801556 we bought a few new players including three who were free agents from spain
7801557 lets all laugh at the mizungus and make them dance

7801563 consumers will lose out and pay higher prices for the privilege unless regulators block the proposed ba american airlines monopoly
7801564 as google probably hoped a cooling off period after that flurry of activity in may has seen what looks like a period of reflection by some of those involved
7801565 the costs of mounting a major legal battle against google are probably just too much given the economic climate

7801570 dear mad gringo my wife is old school and thinks all hawaiian shirts
7801571 i went out on june 2 to stay with a friend and when i got back last monday i found my door had been smashed in
7801572 hes always been one to rise to the occasion but this was about more than that
7801573 this was his way to maybe help quell a mini revolt among the dele gates he likes barack obama and hes worried about the clinton factor hes now going to be the story of this con vention at least until obama gives his acceptance speech and this should completely silence whatever dissen sion exists
7801574 may have accomplished more in the senate than some presidents did in the white house
7801575 i think this is his final hurrah to the party his final gift to the party
7801576 hes the last link to that promising new frontier generation of the 1960s when the world seemed pliable when we were going to make the world a bet ter place when we were going to battle poverty and racism and fight for peace
7801577 to lose him is going to be painful it will feel like were losing those dreams of making the world a better place
7801578 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7801579 i was sick for four days and had severe dizziness my whole body was sore and i had a severe headache
7801580 safy bleu contains the ingredient nafazoline which suppresses the central nervous system when the drops are mixed with alcohol the body temperature drops and the heart rate slows down the person then becomes sweaty and drowsy and may even lose consciousness in severe cases intoxication with this mixture can lead to memrory loss coma and even death
7801581 any drink can be spiked it doesnt have to be alcoholic
7801582 it is most important to know your limits and if you find that you are reacting differently to alcohol than normal then you should ask for help
7801583 take the drink with you to the dance floor and put your thumb over the opening of the bottle
7801584 we conclude that the magnetic field is the only common and most likely factor responsible for the observed alignment
7801585 if your highness allocates instruments like that then i dont give a damn
7801586 prince what you are you are through chance and birth what i am i am through my own labor there are many princes and there will continue to be thousands more but there is only one beethoven
7801587 our common concerns and responsibility have brought us together today
7801588 we are affected by the developments in our city and are looking for a solution
7801589 we urgently ask you to be prudent so that peaceful dialogue is possible
7801590 i found out that new york is actually full of lonely people and i decided to make my programs so that everyone who came to the concert would feel at home
7801591 we are mindful of how the relative strength of the dollar versus the peso could impact peso prices of imported inputs to production including oil and other non oil commodity prices
7801592 currency appreciation helps but under our inflation targeting framework this is not the primary tool for meeting the inflation target we dont target an exchange rate nor go against any underlying market trend
7801593 we are present in the market only to help contain excessive volatilities in the exchange rate which could cause disruptions in effective business planning
7801594 we were at a restaurant where we saw a tree outside hanging with the biggest reddest fruit
7801595 we will not attend the clear message is that the dialogue is still under way and we dont expect any member of the executive to address us until that dialogue has been concluded
7801596 a violation repudiation of some of the conditions on the memorandum of understanding
7801597 we want to have another look at it lottery funding its a positive constructive idea lets see if it works
7801598 we arent just going to concentrate our means on four or five sports to bring home the medals like the british have done

7801601 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
7801602 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
7801603 these types of unethical payments are not anecdotal but rather have been pervasive and industrywide for far too long
7801604 the physicians who take their money are equal participants and equally culpable
7801605 it undermines the message that both candidates have been making on the campaign trail
7801606 when it comes to the campaign finance both conventions are one big gaping loophole
7801607 the presidential race comes down to seven states that could go either way and colorado is one of them
7801608 nevada missouri ohio virginia florida and new hampshire are the other six but these may change over time
7801609 all obama needs to do is pick one or two and the third party or independent candidates could make a difference
7801610 girls need to work twice as hard and rely more on technique than the guys
7801611 were seeing a lot of promising climbers but its such an expensive sport we just want to give them a sustainable taste
7801612 he couser is better than what we have been fighting this is very much the test for sol
7801613 id be happy with a good win and a good defensive performance from sol where he doesnt get hit too often
7801614 it would be lovely to go into the last round with a nice points lead
7801615 the beauty of this and the adjustment of the fees is that everybody who is eligible gets a place theres none of this where some people pay 877 and other people pay 8 000 a year for full private cost recovery
7801616 its demand driven more will participate and the level of skills in the community will increase
7801617 some fees will stay the same and others will rise in line with the expected job opportunities and wage outcomes from engaging in one of those qualifications
7801618 subdued economic prospects and the expectation of additional price hikes continued to depress consumer sentiment
7801619 the german economy is encountering an increasingly more difficult situation
7801620 are markedly more sceptical with regard to the six month outlook
7801621 as slightly positive and the outlook is assessed less critically
7801622 one thing has become crystal clear the german consumer is no match for the rapid slowdown of the global economy
7801623 consumers are not interpreting the marked decrease in crude oil prices as an all clear signal when it comes to purchasing power
7801624 the turnaround in the index lately is a worrying sign that the economy is slowing fast
7801625 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong stand alone value proposition for shareholders
7801626 the driver of demand for our products is urbanisation and industrialisation in heavily populated countries like china and india and these economies continue to grow strongly
7801627 the only black spot was that copper earnings were down slightly after they had some mining issues during the year
7801628 hes probably been the form bowler in the one day form of the game so he deserves his opportunity
7801629 brett led tasmania to a one day final last year so hes right for the picking
7801630 hes a competitor which is all you can ask for
7801631 im up here learning from the best in australia and i couldnt ask for any more
7801632 its the first time ive had the opportunity to keep in australia since adam gilchrist retired
7801633 im jumping at the bit to have an opportunity to play in front of an australian crowd
7801634 in the early days it was a little difficult getting used to that
7801635 but i think as you get older and you mature more for a personal point of view im not really fussed these days
7801636 im pretty comfortable in the role ive been playing at six and seven in the middle order
7801637 we continue to find the way to reach an agreement between israel and the palestinians
7801638 very heartened by the fact that the negotiations are serious and they are intensive
7801639 in fact i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7801640 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7801641 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7801642 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7801643 but at the end of the day the israeli governments policy is not to expand settlements not to build new settlements and not to confiscate palestinian land
7801644 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future of the future borders of the palestinian state
7801645 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and that anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7801646 and we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is palestinian
7801647 the australian high commissioner in nairobi is working closely with the senior members of the somali government to seek mr brennans release
7801648 the somali government has informed us they are using every channel to persuade the kidnappers to release the hostage unconditionally
7801649 we are also in contact with foreign governments with interests in somalia and un agencies in somalia to seek their cooperation and assistance
7801650 we dont know who kidnapped them there is a rebel group which kidnaps for ransom separate from rivals who have political objectives
7801651 we shall do all that is possible to save them
7801652 our travel advice for somalia cautions australians against any travel to somalia and warns of the very high risk of terrorist attack violent crime and kidnapping
7801653 there have been several recent kidnappings of foreign nationals in somalia
7801654 they are beside themselves and feeling helpless but they are trying to stay positive
7801655 we are extremely pleased to be recognised with such a great honour i would like to share these awards with all of our employees customers and service partners who help us run the show this recognition will not only strengthen our commitment to continue satisfying our customer requirements but also motivate and drive us to attain great height by delivering way beyond their expectations
7801656 we confirm that the company and toyota tsusho corp are in negotiations with asian terminal inc for the acquisition of the mariveles grains terminal in bataan
7801657 were now going through final commissioning and we anticipate production of copper concentrate and shipment in september
7801658 weve had a lot of interest from smelters in china india japan and korea but this is a good start for us to work with mri
7801659 weve hedged the first 30 000 tons of concentrate which allows us to enjoy the good copper prices available at the moment

7801663 computerspiele mit gewaltinhalten f hren fter zu erh hten aggressivit tsleveln als beispielsweise das ansehen von horror oder gewaltfilmen
7801664 handelt es sich bei den ursachen f r aggressivit t vielmehr um ein quintett an faktoren in dem der medienkonsum aber eine schl sselrolle einnimmt
7801665 wer in einem elternhaus aufw chst in dem gewalt an der tagesordnung ist ist f r gewalt in medien anf lliger umgekehrt werden die einfl sse von medialer gewalt in sehr harmonischen und liebevollen familien stark abgefedert
7801666 das ergebnis war eindeutig wer viele gewaltt tige computerspiele spielte wurde auch im realen leben aggressiver
7801667 die jugendlichen spielen sich in einen rausch und sind in ihrer welt helden
7801668 das ist im gegensatz zu gewalt und horrorfilmen genau das problem an derartigen spielen denn die jugendlichen schalten oftmals nicht nach 90 minuten ab und gehen danach ihrem sonstigen leben nach sondern die spiele sind teilweise ihr leben
7801669 viel wichtiger ist dass die bestehenden gesetze eingehalten werden und nur die leute die spiele in die hand bekommen die daf r auch alt genug sind
7801670 die eltern sollten wissen was auf dem fernseher ihrer kinder l uft und was sie stundenlang spielen
7801671 das tut es lasst es mich so sagen wir glauben an eine investition in unsere eigenen marken was speziell phil harrison und ich in den letzten f nf jahren mit singstar the getaway oder buzz versuchten es sind unsere und wir k nnen sie in unseren schrank stellen
7801672 es ist wie ein patent wir k nnen sie nach vorne treiben
7801673 wir m ssen akzeptieren dass mehr und mehr hersteller keine exklusivtitel machen k nnen sofern sie nicht millionen ber millionen von dollar erhalten um ein spezielles spiel f r eine plattform zu entwickeln
7801674 aber f r die entwickler man k nnte ein unternehmen wie quantic dream als beispiel nehmen ein gro artiges spiel es dauert sehr lange um es zu produzieren und sie brauchen ein wenig finanzierung mitsamt externer entwicklung im gegenzug ist es exklusiv das funktioniert eine exklusivit t mit entwicklern ist m glicherweise wahrscheinlicher als eine exklusivit t mit publishern
7801675 ich denke wir m ssen akzeptieren dass exklusivit ten kein relikt der vergangenheit sind aber m glicherweise mit den publishern wir k nnten ein paar dinge tun bei denen wir f hlen dass sie hier oder da einen ansto ben tigen
7801676 ich denke dass wir nach dem massiven anstieg mit gta iv das nicht exklusiv war die exakt gleiche wirkung mit final fantasy erzielen
7801677 ich wei dass es auf der playstation 3 gro artig aussehen wird und es liegt an microsoft dies klarzustellen in japan ist es noch immer exklusiv
7801678 die idee war street fighter 2 als fundament zu nehmen
7801679 i think a lot of things have happened since that document came out that was a get a foot through the door document but it has nothing to do with the purchase of the football club and nothing to do with the source of funding the money is from a swiss bank
7801680 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
7801681 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
7801682 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
7801683 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
7801684 im convinced more than ever by the fact we had this team together for three years and that was the telling difference in the game
7801685 it was a great game a pressure game from the get go and we never cracked the fact weve been together for this period of time was the difference
7801686 on the one hand i mourn the loss of my father in law greatly and my heart aches for my wife and our family for the loss
7801687 on the other hand i am extremely proud and happy for my team and usa volleyball as an organization and the thing weve been able to achieve over these four years those are the two emotions i have they are conflicted obviously but i cannot change what happened in either sphere
7801688 chuck norris destroyed the periodic table because he only recognizes the element of surprise
7801689 there is no theory of evolution just a list of creatures chuck norris has let live
7801690 chuck norris doesnt wear a watch he decides what time it is
7801691 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
7801692 the quintessential yucatan eating experience is attained somewhere outdoors the view isnt great the tablecloth if there is one is oilcloth atop a cheap plastic or metal table donated to the restaurant by coca cola the food is dripping with sauce hot and tasty your fingers and hands are covered with it and your mouth is on fire with chili de habanero you reach for a napkin to wipe your hands and all you get is a tiny wafer thin servieta but you have to do it so you can hold that cold glass of coca cola or agua de whatever long enough to quench the fire inside for just a moment
7801693 they say i live on a dollar a month but this is all lies by people who dont want my brother to win
7801694 george said he expected no favours and wanted to work for a living even though he was confident that his brother would defeat john mccain and move into the white house
7801695 subdued economic prospects and the expectation of additional price hikes continued to depress consumer sentiment
7801696 the german economy is encountering an increasingly more difficult situation
7801697 are markedly more sceptical with regard to the six month outlook
7801698 as slightly positive and the outlook is assessed less critically
7801699 one thing has become crystal clear the german consumer is no match for the rapid slowdown of the global economy
7801700 consumers are not interpreting the marked decrease in crude oil prices as an all clear signal when it comes to purchasing power
7801701 the turnaround in the index lately is a worrying sign that the economy is slowing fast
7801702 get a sheet of foil a bit bigger than an a4 piece of paper and put a peeled banana on it sliced down the middle randomly stuff chopped marshmallows and a chopped mars bar between the two banana halves and wrap it all up in foil heat it up on the bbq or in a fryingpan until the chocolate melts and then dig in its not very classy lol its veerry messy to eat but its my favourite dessert ever it reminds me of summer holidays as a kid
7801703 grab the oars men row row like your life depended on it you think it doesnt who told you it didnt
7801704 please keep your arms and legs inside the moving ship at all times
7801705 we move like the wind on the back of a great stampede of whales by this rate well be in albania by nightfall but wait
7801706 men do not abandon hope it is my oath to my loyal crew that these damn pirates will not board this ship send them home with broken peg legs and ripped eye patches hoorah
7801707 no one calls me by that name that values their life prepare to die a most rueful demise in the wench that is the sea
7801708 dementsprechend hat ea nicht vor irgendwelche weiteren ank ndigungen hinsichtlich des status jedweder diskussionen oder verhandlungen vorzunehmen bis die gespr che zwischen ea und take two abgebrochen wurden oder eine einigung erzielt worden ist
7801709 konami sagt danke leipzig f r die vielen gro artigen jahre und eine rundum positive zeit hier

7801711 die leute sagen warum bekommen wir die dinge immer zuletzt warum k nnen wir nicht dinge bekannt geben ich habe es schon mehrfach gesagt manchmal ist es von vorteil in europa letzter zu sein wisst ihr bis alles geregelt wurde
7801712 diesmal hatten wir etwas in europa zu sagen wir haben den musik service und machen gro artige dinge mit singstar und es kommt noch mehr es sind globale ank ndigungen
7801713 wir haben uns bei unserer dritten gc erneut in allen bereichen gesteigert und bekommen dies auch von unseren g sten der presse und des handels erneut best tigt nach dem erfolg von 2007 war es wichtig in diesem jahr direkt mit einem weiteren starken auftritt anzukn pfen und dies ist uns in jeder hinsicht gelungen
7801714 die gc 2008 war f r uns der bedeutendste event des jahres und gleichzeitig auch ein gro er erfolg auf internationaler ebene leipzig ist ber die letzten jahre zu weit mehr als einer spielemesse herangewachsen die show ist das mit abstand wichtigste branchen treffen weltweit und leistet dank der enormen medialen beachtung einen gro artigen beitrag zur au endarstellung unserer gesamten industrie
7801715 auch dieses jahr war die games convention f r uns wieder ein voller erfolg ob heavy rain killzone 2 und resistance 2 motorstorm pacific rift oder aber die adaptionen der beliebten partyspiele singstar und buzz f r ps3 unser umfangreiches line up wurde mit begeisterung aufgenommen
7801716 gerade der neue trend selbst erstellte inhalte in das spiel zu integrieren zum beispiel bei

7801727 das ist tats chlich passiert und k nnte morgen passieren
7801728 i respect mike a lot he helped me a lot and im not opposed to mike coming back in some capacity
7801729 mike to me was a lot more than just a special teams coach i know that thats the most visible aspect of what he does but he was a really big asset in terms of game management penalties and some of the decisions
7801730 when he left he didnt leave because of anything in terms of him not being happy with the organization or me not being happy with mike mike is a great coach and i really like mike a lot
7801731 were not really at that point because medically there are still things he has to take care of
7801732 if i was a giant id do whatever i could to get him out and have him back on my team
7801733 the guy still looks great hes a hell of a player i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7801734 but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back in that room
7801735 he was more than ready to do whatever we wanted him to do in the best interest of the team
7801736 i was told all along if something were to happen this is a position i could find myself in
7801737 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7801738 its an opportunity i was looking to take one way or another
7801739 you never want it to be from an injury to get in there its an opportunity im looking forward to
7801740 i decided to pull the old car out of the garage and see how i felt
7801741 get some of the dust off it i felt really good im feeling a lot better 100 percent
7801742 the atmosphere here is about the same those years we made the playoffs in minnesota
7801743 our goal is to win the division just like its been all year just like it was last year
7801744 we remember what happened weve talked about it and now we can do something about it if we keep playing the way we can play
7801745 the last time i talked with michael two weeks ago in albany he had accepted his new challenge and was very happy about that
7801746 there hasnt been any discussion about strahan that i have been involved in
7801747 hey if i was a giant id do whatever i could to get him out and have him back on my team
7801748 the guy still looks great hes a hell of a player i mean i would have done whatever to try and get him back initially
7801749 but now i mean how could you not want him back
7801750 sometimes we get too caught up in that pitch count thing
7801751 where we are at now complete games are huge for us
7801752 we lost billy wagner now john maine its tough man but now is not the time to think about that we just have to find a way to win
7801753 im not grinding through innings im just concerned with making pitches at the bottom of the strike zone
7801754 no you just got to go with your best and your best got to face the best got to face your toughest foe thats where i am at this point
7801755 i guess that rest thing is over whenever they give me the ball im going to take it and try to win
7801756 i feel like im bobbing and weaving out there and every now and then i get caught bam
7801757 john maine is proven and you want to have proven guys going down the stretch
7801758 this is a pennant race youve got to grind it out
7801759 we are in the fight of our lives and have to go with our best
7801760 the options we are considering are guys that can get the job done
7801761 if we put on a run here theres no question we can make it
7801762 theres no question with the number of games we have left its possible
7801763 we have been counted out so many times may and recently we have nothing to lose
7801764 hopefully the red sox are feeling the pressure not only from us but from others
7801765 we dont need to sweep but we cant afford to lose any more series this year
7801766 there is no reason this team shouldnt be able to win series
7801767 i didnt think it was the right time in april
7801768 but tonight i had six rbis two home runs i think its the right time i think i learned my lesson and instead of talking about it for three weeks i came out appreciate it and i guess it is water under the bridge
7801769 john maine is a big part of this team that we cant replace
7801770 but the other guys were going to have to step up
7801771 jerry said hey you think michael would have some interest
7801772 obviously theres not any pro bowl defensive ends out there except him im sure theres a part of him that wants to play do i think its a big part no
7801773 michael always works out but has he been working out as if hes going to play football no
7801774 there hasnt been any discussion i have been involved with there
7801775 ive always wanted to play in the final preseason game
7801776 i dont know whats going to happen but i would assume he would probably say no
7801777 if thats the case then so be it i can get some practice in well be ok i dont know if six plays although i would like to do it what you get out of that
7801778 not sure we have these two days of practice im going to see what it looks like over the two days and then evaluate it i cant say definitively no or definitively yes
7801779 i always listen to the players sometimes you just agree to disagree
7801780 well i guess no more of a concern than coming in late and having a week to prepare for my first game like i did two weeks ago to me that was a real game based on the circumstances
7801781 at least in this case i will have some practice and have worked with these guys
7801782 completely id be lying if i said yes but i felt a lot more comfortable the other night against the giants although we made a lot more mistakes
7801783 once you start game planning for teams to a certain extent you simplify things and you go to bat with things you feel comfortable with
7801784 ive never really thought about getting hurt and im not saying osi did think about it
7801785 i saw the tape that was meant to be its very unfortunate for him and for the giants but it wasnt like guys rolled up on him that injury probably would have happened in practice at some point the way it occurred
7801786 i decided to pull the old car out of the garage and see how i felt today get some of the dust off of it
7801787 i felt pretty good im feeling a lot better 100 i didnt have any limitations going either way right or left i jumped up and made a few catches im just trying to get back to my old self getting off the line full speed and being able to accelerate when the ball is in the air im trying to get all the kinks out of the armor
7801788 i havent talked with him coach eric mangini about it
7801789 i dont know whats going to happen i would assume that hell probably say no and if thats the case so be it
7801790 ive never really thought about injuries and im not saying osi did think about it but he just went down injuries come in a lot of different ways
7801791 they want to see if there is any interest there
7801792 ill never fully get over it and i dont think anyone would expect me to
7801793 i am not open to talk about whats next because if there is a hiccup its big news when it really isnt
7801794 as long as the hitters keep doing what they are doing we will be ok
7801795 i dont worry about the catching now we were an injury away from a major problem
7801796 the trade set us up to deal with whatever happens
7801797 were sorry but the page you requested could not be found

7801801 i would say some people thought we were going to die
7801802 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7801803 it was obvious to me that there was depressurisation in the cabin but there was no announcement and no evidence of the cabin crew for most of this experience why on earth didnt they give a few more calming words to the passengers
7801804 whilst thousands of people came to join in with the fun and spectacle of carnival once again the event ended with a small minority of people determined to fight and cause trouble
7801805 for over two hours our officers were faced with a hardcore mainly of young men who came to the carnival not to enjoy the event but to fight commit crime and cause trouble
7801806 officers had to work hard and deliver a strong interventionist style of policing late into the night to make sure that these criminals were not allowed to take over the streets of notting hill this is not the way anyone can want to see the carnival finish
7801807 through our stop and search use of screening wands and seizures of dangerous dogs we sent a clear message that the carnival is no place for such behaviour as this
7801808 that omission sends a message that verges on the sinister not that ministers have abandoned their commitment to decency and fairness but that when it comes to devising strategies for dealing with the numbers crisis and the other challenges facing the prison estate the monitoring task has simply disappeared off the agenda
7801809 we are concerned that the government seems to be going back on jack straws own statement that we cannot build ourselves out of the prison numbers crisis
7801810 we are not just dealing with overcrowding though overcrowding is a serious problem in some prisons we are also dealing with a system that is overwhelmed by numbers
7801811 everybodys in shock there are no words to describe it really the whole road loves them

7801816 we have been firm and steadfast in observing the ban on high risk and adverse areas for land based filipino workers maybe it is time to propose that filipino seafarers not be allowed to go on ships that endanger the life and limb of its passengers
7801817 the risks to their life and limb are terrible and it is our obligation to reduce those risks we have to look into the contract maybe our seafarers need not be used in international waters that are dangerous
7801818 much like in the u s the european venture industry is experiencing great softness in the ipo and m amp a markets and this is putting a damper on deal flow
7801819 in particular health care companies which have seen the pipeline of ipos dry up over the last year posted their worst quarter on record were seeing a similar downward trend for health care companies in the u s where investment has fallen off 31 in the first six months of the year
7801820 there is a silver lining in this quarters figures and its that we are seeing early stage deals make up a greater percentage of deal activity in europe
7801821 venture capitalists are being very selective about the companies they back but theyre by no means abandoning the european market in the first six months of the year 44 of venture deals in europe were seed or first rounds we havent seen this level of early stage interest since the first half of 2001
7801822 i enter the parade every year and obviously the olympics are the topic of the day
7801823 it is an absolutely brilliant display it is amazing how a little village like lambourn can turn out something like this its the best one for years
7801824 we were going to have snow white as our theme but we decided on a magical garden with gnomes and elves it was a good carnival this year and i think there were more floats than last year
7801825 we have all the bugs you would find in a garden and a wormery
7801826 the idea started with recycling and composting and self sufficiency and im a gardener myself
7801827 it was the most entries we have had for a number of years i think people were concerned that they didnt lose the carnival because of what has happened with other carnivals in the area disappearing
7801828 the parade route was long and quite a hard job for the walkers the walking entries were very good this year and people put a lot of effort into the floats

7801846 der bfw geht davon aus dass langfristig ein volumen von rund 25 millionen wohn riester vertr gen realistisch ist entscheidende einflussfaktoren sind die demografische entwicklung die einkommensentwicklung aber auch die inflation
7801847 umfragen zeigen dass rund zwei drittel der deutschen von einem eigenheim tr umen und die selbstgenutzte immobilie f r die ideale altersvorsorge halten die f rderung ist zwar kein ad quater ersatz der eigenheimzulage aber ein wichtiger schritt vielen menschen diesen traum von den eigenen vier w nden zu erm glichen
7801848 durch die staatlichen zulagen ist das wohn riester modell insbesondere f r kinderreiche familien sowie schwellenhaushalte attraktiv f r die der erwerb von wohneigentum durch den wegfall der eigenheimrente deutlich erschwert worden ist hier sind angesichts der niedrigen eigentumsquote deutschlands sicher wachstumspotenziale denkbar
7801849 damit haben die deutschen hersteller ihren marktanteil auf dem russischen markt gegen ber dem jahr 2004 nahezu verdreifacht jeder siebte neuwagen der derzeit in russland zugelassen wird ist eine deutsche konzernmarke
7801850 diese beispiele zeigen dass die deutschen hersteller den russischen pkw markt offensiv mit ihrer attraktiven produktpalette bedienen und ihre position insbesondere im premiumsegment konsequent weiter ausbauen
7801851 diese strengen abgasnormen f hren zu zus tzlichen investitionen und bieten gerade deutschen herstellern und zulieferern gute wachstumschancen

7801854 villagers had asked the militants to surrender before they laid siege
7801855 but the militants requested safe passage that was denied then the militants threw a hand grenade in the direction of the villagers to break the siege
7801856 we fear the taliban could replicate the same in buner if they were given a free hand we have held several meetings and decided that we wouldnt let buner go swats way
7801857 we are seeing the writing on the wall if we dont prevent the taliban at this stage there is every possibility the military would launch an operation and the 11million population would be migrating in a state of helplessness to safer areas
7801858 the taliban had already bombed about a dozen girls schools besides bombing 50 cd shops and attacking police stations
7801859 before the taliban resorts to torching more schools we have decided to resist them
7801860 we are not going to let the taliban play with the future of our people we dont want schools to be burnt and our coming generations uneducated
7801861 the good news is that all the political parties are supporting the move because it has paid off in the context of buner
7801862 all the criminals in these areas are carrying out anti social activities in the garb of the taliban the taliban used to be students of religious schools who guided the people on the right path but now the situation is quite the opposite they are leading anti social activities
7801863 we will kill any person seen after midnight we have advised the local population not to come out of their houses
7801864 the arrest is part of an ongoing investigation by lancashire constabulary and greater manchester counter terrorism unit
7801865 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
7801866 we will endeavour to carry out any searches as quickly as possible to minimise impact on the area concerned

7801874 jurisprudence has it that prior to the declaration of nullity the challenged statute must have been in force and had to be complied with until the court in appropriate case declares its invalidity
7801875 the moa ad cannot be declared unconstitutional as it was never operative considering its non self executing nature it necessitates further operative acts before legally demandable rights and obligations may be sourced from the same
7801876 neither the petitioners nor the respondents can foresee what the future may bring with respect to negotiations with milf

7801885 they dont earn your respect theyre there living being themselves you earn their respect
7801886 you buy a cat or maybe you find one in the ally next to your apartment you bring her home and bathe her and feed her you give her a name and you care for her but shes not appreciative she takes your charity for granted you spend that night with her and thats it as far as you know shell be gone the next morning and youll never see her again
7801887 maybe ive got everything she needs she just might be very comfortable in my black and white apartment
7801888 she doesnt like to stay in one place shes a drifter
7801889 she doesnt need what people give her they just try to get her love
7801890 she gets to travel the world getting tastes of every city lavished in love wanted by the world why wouldnt it be easy
7801891 she cant ever just settle on one taste she doesnt ever feel complete to be irresistable and unatainable makes her voracious shes always hungry
7801892 i need you i cant let this go dont ever leave
7801893 god i need you i crave you i adore you
7801894 youve got to have a disciplined system to be able to manage so many individual animals every day and foot care is the big management issue with goats
7801895 based on a cow giving 30 litres a day and a goat giving three litres meant we needed 10 goats for every cow because goats milk is twice the price of cows milk we needed 1000 goats to generate the same income as 200 cows so if we could milk 1500 2000 goats we could double the size of the business
7801896 a female kid is in milk by the time its a year old so provided we make good use of superior genetics we should make relatively rapid progress and improve the herds quality and output certainly much faster than we could do with a new dairy herd
7801897 this isnt like breeding dairy cows goat dairying in terms of recording and genetics is way behind the dairy cattle industry were using the best saanen and toggenburg billies based on stature udder and yield on nannies of mixed breeding because in a purely commercial enterprise cross breeding is accepted as the norm
7801898 the aim is to get the benefit of the high winter milk price so nannies are mated in december and january we run around one billy to 70 nannies

7801910 we couldnt get out of there we were videomakers on a permit from the city and the cops wouldnt let us leave we even screamed please let us out were documenting
7801911 man i saw three undercover cops today wearing bandanas over their heads like bikers we confronted them they didnt know anyone wearing nikes but they were planning this theyve totally infiltrated

7801963 from our exit poll figures and what we are tracking anwar is safely leading in the polls and i think that it is right to say about 61 percent
7801964 we are still not declaring victory as we will wait for the from the election commission
7801965 we are expecting anwars win to be as big as when wan azizah contested but we think that it will be less in terms of absolute numbers due to it being a working day for many

7801972 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7801973 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions

7802094 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
7802095 we already know that genetics and childhood infections play a vital role in the development of type 1 diabetes in children but the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life
7802096 this study shows a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7802097 it is important to stress that the reason for this is still not understood although it is possible that the caesarean section itself is responsible perhaps because babies born via that method are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7802098 type 1 diabetes in childhood has become much more prevalent across europe recently and the rate of this increase suggests that environmental factors are the cause however despite much investigation these actual factors remain largely unknown

7802120 they have been together for more than 100 years and the vatican wants to disturb that peace to cover up the fact that cardinal newman loved a man

7802195 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects and they will continue to do that until they hopefully capture these individuals
7802196 to get tunnel vision on where one suspect might be going we could actually miss the lead on another one
7802197 jaju has been on the run since two years and was arrested today from the city of mau in madhya pradesh he has been accused of threatening chopra of dire consequences if he is not given his job back
7802198 the web site is a self care solution targeting post deployment adjustment concerns
7802199 individuals who might not otherwise seek out services can now be empowered to use afterdeployments resources at their own pace
7802200 we also recognized that our user population is knowledgeable about computers
7802201 the intent then was to build a site that offered more than just a lot of text based articles we wanted the materials to be interactive we wanted to give users a variety of ways to access the information
7802202 if a user wanted to get a better understanding about their stress level or their anger problem they can take a quick self assessment right on the site and get some immediate feedback concerning their scores
7802203 netop faldet i forventningsindekset der i august n ede det svageste niveau siden februar 1993 er bestemt ikke noget der lover godt for udsigterne for den tyske konomi da de meget dystre fremtidsudsigter formentlig vil have indflydelse p virksomhedernes investerings og besk ftigelsesbeslutninger i negativ retning
7802204 det hastigt faldende ifo indeks bekr fter os s ledes i vores bange anelser om at euroomr dets konomi er for hastigt nedadg ende og det styrker os ogs i vores forventninger om at den europ iske centralbanks fokus vil skifte v k fra inflationstruslen og over i retning af bekymring omkring den konomiske situation
7802205 apabila telah sampai ajal seseorang itu maka akan masuklah satu kumpulan malaikat ke dalam lubang lubang kecil dalam badan dan kemudian mereka menarik rohnya melalui kedua dua telapak kakinya sehingga sampai ke lutut setelah itu datang pula sekumpulan malaikat yang lain masuk menarik roh dari lutut hingga sampai ke perut dan kemudiannya mereka keluar datang lagi satu kumpulan malaikat yang lain masuk dan menarik rohnya dari perut hingga sampai ke dada dan kemudiannya mereka keluar dan akhir sekali datang lagi satu kumpulan malaikat masuk dan menarik roh dari dadanya hingga sampai ke kerongkong dan itulah yang dikatakan saat nazak orang itu
7802206 kalau orang yang nazak itu orang yang beriman maka malaikat jibril a s akan menebarkan sayapnya yang disebelah kanan sehingga orang yang nazak itu dapat melihat kedudukannya di syurga apabila orang yang beriman itu melihat syurga maka dia akan lupa kepada orang yang berada disekelilinginya ini adalah kerana sangat rindunya pada syurga dan melihat terus pandangannya kepada sayap jibril a s
7802207 tidak ada jalan bagimu mencabut roh orang ini melalui jalan ini kerana orang ini sentiasa menjadikan lidahnya berzikir kepada allah s w t
7802208 tidak ada jalan bagimu dari arah ini kerana kaki ini sentiasa berjalan berulang alik mengerjakan solat dengan berjemaah dan kaki ini juga berjalan menghadiri majlis majlis ilmu
7802209 wahai malaikatku tulis asmaku ditelapak tanganmu dan tunjukkan kepada roh orang yang beriman itu

7802211 menghadapi masalah internasional yang pelik dan demonstrasi hebat yang sedang berkecamuk di luar sana bagaimana anda bisa bersikap begitu tenang pak presiden

7802216 we hope the new tools in the hands of home buyers from the recently enacted housing stimulus package will spark a sustained sales uptrend in the months ahead
7802217 buyers whove been on the sidelines should take a closer look at whats available to them now in terms of financing and incentives given some of the inventory on the market we also strongly encourage buyers to get a professional home inspection
7802218 sales have picked up significantly in several florida and california markets home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
7802219 still inventory remains high in many parts of the country and will require time to fully absorb we expect more balanced conditions in 2009 and will eventually return to normal long term appreciation patterns

7802260 for where your treasure is there your heart will abide
7802261 one of obamas strongest distinctions from mccain was his wisdom and courage in opposing the invasion of iraq by choosing biden however who was as big a backer of the war as the republican nominee obama is now saying that this doesnt really matter thereby negating one of his biggest advantages bidens experience is that of a militarist whose contempt for international law has been apparent in hard line positions on iraq and other critical foreign policy issues
7802262 this isnt american democracy in action its the failure of american democracy before we go to war with iraq we must be able to determine that iraq poses a threat to the national security of the united states such a determination must be backed up with substantive fact i believe that iraq does not pose a threat to the u s worthy of war this conclusion is shared by many senior military officers according to president bush and his advisers iraq is known to possess weapons of mass destruction and is actively seeking to reconstitute the weapons production capabilities i bear personal witness through seven years as a chief weapons inspector in iraq for the un to both the scope of iraqs weapons of mass destruction programs and the effectiveness of the un weapons inspectors in ultimately eliminating them while we were never able to provide 100 percent certainty regarding the disposition of iraqs proscribed weaponry we did ascertain a 90 95 percent level of verified disarmament these are the sort of facts that must be included in any hearing that seeks to determine the threat posed by iraq today it is clear that sen biden and his colleagues have no interest in such facts
7802263 i do not believe this is a rush to war i believe it is a march to peace and security i believe that failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur saddam hussein possesses chemical and biological weapons and is seeking nuclear weapons
7802264 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after i am absolutely confident the president will not take us to war alone
7802265 it became obvious to me 18 months to two years ago that with the retreat of the multiyear polar sea ice the coast guard was going to have to do more than it had in the past to provide maritime safety and security to northern and western alaska the arctic ocean and the beaufort sea
7802266 through the spring and summer weve been conducting a test bed for moving various coast guard units into the arctic environment and determining their suitability for service in northern alaska
7802267 the biggest hazard frankly is ensuring that we avoid sea ice
7802268 and the second issue is that helicopter operations will be constrained because in the arctic we have a concern with the ability to self rescue
7802269 so when you start launching helicopters and sending boats over the horizon you now have to worry about how do you get them back
7802270 for example if i have a ship of a certain size with a certain crew and a certain cargo inbound to new york at ambrose we understand what that means because we know the infrastructure
7802271 we know the traffic patterns we know past history with the company we know all the surrounding information for a vessel contact in much of the world
7802272 in order to project a surface presence in that part of the world for any extended period of time we very quickly realize that because of the weather conditions meaning that even though its more ice free than ever theres still ice much of the year and the distances involved these places are very far away
7802273 the issue of the full function operations the requirement to do everything we do in southern alaska in northern alaska at least seasonally will take several years perhaps up to five years to ramp up to a capability
7802274 and thats why were pushing forward to be positioned and to be prepared to ensure that we dont have a titanic of the north like the motor vessel explorer in antarctica last november
7802275 surprisingly the median household is just as good as the average professional economist
7802276 im a little surprised because economists are using sophisticated models but the consumers know whats happening with milk prices
7802277 it means economists need to improve their forecasting or at least be a little humble
7802278 inflation expectations are one of the most important factors in the economic environment
7802279 so if consumers lose confidence that could bring us into a bad economic situation
7802280 when theres rising inflation its beneficial to be in debt to purchase real assets because youll pay your debt back with money that wont be worth as much in the future
7802281 its important to test any scientific tool because all have limits some situations are more suited than others for barcode use
7802282 this research could help clarify the answer to that question
7802283 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
7802284 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
7802285 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal
7802286 but we need to pay careful attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
7802287 ask him if he knows of any places to rent around here
7802288 i really was just getting back into feeling 100 percent
7802289 i had a great week of practice that week and i was feeling really good then to get hurt really just kind of crushed my attitude
7802290 i took all those months off and started rehabbing it and taking it real slow and i think that really helped
7802291 he didnt do anything in the spring because we wanted to be 100 percent certain that his arm was going to be healed
7802292 hes had no restrictions in august most of our kids came back the first monday of august so he hit the ground running
7802293 hes still a little rusty because he hasnt done anything with 11 people but his arm strength is just about back to normal and his accuracy is still there
7802294 i really didnt want to let my team down to get hurt like that was tough to deal with but really im just hoping for the best this year i feel a lot better
7802295 whether grazing or resting these animals face either magnetic north or south
7802296 our results call for an in depth study of this phenomenon and challenge neuroscientists biochemists and physicists to study the proximate mechanisms and biological significance of magnetic alignment
7802297 birds turtles and salmon are known to use the earths magnetic field to guide their migrations while rodents and one bat species have been found to possess an internal magnetic compass

7802299 there was a security incident in peshawar this morning involving a u s consulate vehicle and three employees there were no injuries and minimal damage to the vehicle
7802300 we are coordinating with pakistani authorities in investigating the incident the consulate is open and operating normally
7802301 while conditions in the nwfp have been dangerous for some time the province has not been completely out of bounds in selective cases maybe that will have to change now
7802302 it is impossible to tell if the attack in peshawar was in retaliation to the ban but obviously it is worth asking if the taliban swiftly retaliated
7802303 the way these people are growing as a nuisance for pakistan there has to be a firm response
7802304 in the short term of course there will be lots of bloodshed but can pakistan afford a half hearted response especially when this problem is growing so rapidly
7802305 will increase its war deterrent in every way as long as the u s and its followers continue posing military threats to it
7802306 the army and people of north korea will never remain an onlooker to the u s military and the south korean bellicose forces staging frantic anti north korea war moves
7802307 should the u s imperialists and their following forces misjudge north koreas will and act rashly
7802308 will mercilessly wipe out the aggressors to the last man

7802378 the group has always been committed towards jordan and jordanians with active participation in the technological social and economic renaissance today the group continues the initiative it started with qrce in addition to other initiatives geared towards the whole society geared towards supporting the jordanian youths spirit of innovation entrepreneurship and creativity
7802379 on this occasion we thank orange for their generous support to the qrce our partnership started when orange sponsored qrnec in its first year which was also the year the first business plan competition was launched in jordan our competition at that time was targeting jordans youth as we believe it is this particular segment of the society that holds the creativity and innovation needed to steer jordans markets towards new and unprecedented heights

7802382 it seems last night monday there was a build up of security forces around the camp
7802383 the police force will remain in its place until it enters the camp to collect the stockpiled weapons and prevent the rebels from getting inside the camp
7802384 the situation is very bad the people are really suffering
7802385 we are concerned by indiscriminate weapons fire by sudanese government forces on the kalma internally displaced persons camp

7802387 the dialogue has not been completed it is arrogant and reckless for anybody to come and address parliament mugabe is not mandated by anyone to address parliament nobody has the right to address parliament before talks are completed

7802389 this vote somehow exposes divisions that have been slowly creeping up within the ruling party
7802390 the worship of the living and true god is essentially an engagement with him on the terms that he proposes and in the way that he alone makes possible
7802391 when we believe that we should be satisfied rather than god glorified in our worship then we put god below ourselves as though he had been made for us rather than that we had been made for him
7802392 all of history is moving toward one great goal the white hot worship of god and his son among all the peoples of the earth missions exist because worship doesnt worship is ultimate not missions because god is ultimate not man when this age is over and the countless millions of the redeemed fall on their faces before the throne of god missions will be no more it is a temporary necessity but worship abides forever

7802403 if only they had done it exactly they way i told them to it would have been perfect
7802404 some not all but some of the loudest voices in the
7802405 if only they had done it exactly they way i told them to it would have been perfect
7802406 he got some fastballs he had short quick swings and stayed on the ball good he went the other way good rollins is going to hit hes got a good swing hes got a very good approach at the plate
7802407 hes a good dude hes very honest with how he feels about certain pitchers and stuff like that its a good compliment from him that im tough to get a hit off of i guess
7802408 vi er ikke immune mot kjeltringer blant oss hvis jeg allerede n kjente til noen ville de ikke v re i live etter morgendagen kort prosess det er fordi jeg er humanist at jeg har dette synspunktet
7802409 humanister anser demokratiet og individets rettigheter for v re grunnleggende rasjonelt begrunnede verdier vi tar avstand fra totalit re religi se og politiske ideologier og tenkem ter
7802410 er humanister rett og slett ateister som tror p det leve et meningsfylt og etisk liv
7802411 if you get in here by about 8 in the morning you can be out of here by noon and the rest of the day is yours
7802412 sometimes i do appearances but if im not really doing anything ill do whatever errands i have to do because you really dont have much time to do them the rest of the week
7802413 i try to be a handyman but usually ill make things worse then ill call the plumber something like that but for the most part im just watching sports on television
7802414 i look for what they like to do on first second and third down ill just put the tape in and look at all first down passes first and second down runs third down nickel stuff
7802415 everything has to be done for the players by tuesday night
7802416 they all get a book of the game plan it shows the opponents pass plays and runs its a pretty good sized book and it takes a little time to put that together meantime the offensive coaches are off doing their own thing
7802417 we could go until about 11 oclock its like getting ready for a final exam every week you want to have as much knowledge as you can so we try to get everything fed to the players on wednesday
7802418 it all depends what works for you like just talking on the phone with your loved ones or like just paying bills thatll get your mind off it
7802419 i dont have a lot of physical demands in this game but the mental part wears on you
7802420 my wife says im like a woman with pms the last two months of the season it kind of builds up as the year goes on so i need those stress release days to not think about stuff it kind of builds back up wednesday thursday friday and saturday then im pretty revved up on sunday so on tuesday i try not to come in at all if possible i dont have to watch film
7802421 we might go to chuck e cheese or swim in the pool
7802422 my son races quarter midgets miniature racing cars and i do racing on the computer i do friday nights at atco raceway my daughters getting in the band its just a lot of fun seeing them do things and it makes you realize honestly that football is a job but its not your life
7802423 i think its easier said than done especially if youve had a bad game or you lost
7802424 when that happens you find yourself sitting around thinking about the plays you could have made thats why its important that by this point youve learned to have a short memory
7802425 its a chance to get your heart and your head at 100 percent
7802426 your hands are supposed to lead the swing and your body stays behind the ball
7802427 you reset and let yourself forget how you even do it
7802428 then you find good habits ive been here before its been a long time though so today i took a step back to forget
7802429 pressing takes up too much energy theres too much energy being stressed or upset or whatever
7802430 if you leave it on theyre going to hit you on top of your head
7802431 back in the day nobody knew him but villanova said we want to follow you
7802432 they offered him before anybody else got involved he took an unofficial visit up there its a small school with great academics and he felt comfortable with the whole situation
7802433 you know its going to be a physical contest so i know im going to be getting off the floor a lot slower playing with the kids
7802434 theres not going to be too much physical conduct in the household as far as playing with the kids or roughhousing because i know im going to be beat up after those games i know
7802435 hell have a chance to review it because a lot of it is on his shoulders wednesday as to how the offense goes
7802436 it just shows that both of these guys have been around a long time and theyve proven their worth at doing what they are doing
7802437 i dont have any doubt he will pitch this year
7802438 hes been a good player in the league for years and the fact that hes willing to come here on a tryout is good for us
7802439 i like to come in and compete at a high level i want to show them that i can play and hopefully make the team and be able to contribute and help out in any way i can
7802440 jimmy was an older guy who came in last year and made our team
7802441 we had a lot of young players and jimmy provided a veteran presence were going to give berard an opportunity and see how he does
7802442 i had it happen when i was 32 in the ahl he was a young player when he was injured and very determined to get back
7802443 has hindered him a little hes lost some of the sight in the eye but the fact hes playing tells you something about the character of the individual
7802444 donovan and l j s were both more extensive and a lot more damage was going on down there so i wouldnt expect to take as long to get back as they took
7802445 definitely said it was smart that we went in there and did it
7802446 he was able to fix what was going on down there and hes pretty optimistic i should have a speedy recovery
7802447 i dont think theres too much of a timetable right now
7802448 right now im just walking im increasing it about a quarter mile each day from what i understand thats all ill be doing for the next week or so down the road ill start jogging and stretching
7802449 i definitely dont want to come back too early and put myself out for more of the season
7802450 i dont have a game in sight but i want to get back out as soon as possible
7802451 you have to be in tune with your body i guess ive never had this injury ill work with the trainers but ultimately its my body and when im ready hopefully ill feel good out there
7802452 i know i started feeling it about three or four days into training camp this year it started giving me problems and it gradually became harder and harder to get through practice i definitely continued to aggravate it and tweak it more
7802453 then there was more than a couple where he splattered just a little bit so the fundamental and technique work there will come into play
7802454 theres a battle there now jason davis is a pretty good fullback there i think he has some skill and ability
7802455 its hard not to look feminine am i right or am i wrong
7802456 but would i do it yeah id do it i dont know how far id get i might look like jerry springer did when he was on
7802457 i think a lot of the guys would do it but probably none of us would be good
7802458 i think maybe donovan mcnabb and omar gaither might do it i think outgoing guys like them might do it but me no no way first of all i cant dance like that maybe i could learn but i just have better things to do with my time than play around with ballroom dancing
7802459 i mean its something thatll bring you a lot of publicity but i dont want that im just a low key type guy who does what i do and moves along
7802460 but you dont hear them saying theyd like to be on the show
7802461 mainly because there are usually professional athletes who are part of the show jerry rice emmitt smith people like that
7802462 but no way i would do it its just not something id want to learn i mean after being on that show where would i go to dance like that even if i learned
7802463 and i dont think id want to spend my off season learning how to ballroom dance when i could be doing something i really enjoy like being on the lake with my boat
7802464 maybe the ballroom dancing i could do but the other stuff sometimes looks too feminine to me
7802465 youve got to do that to pull it off you know what i mean
7802466 even smith rice and taylor had to do things that looked a little bit feminine to pull it off and thats just not for me there are probably a handful of dudes on the eagles who would go on the show but not this cat here
7802467 i was the biggest supporter of the olympics i thought it would calm russia down but the fact they got it emboldened them
7802468 this guy putin thinks that statements dont mean anything and that the west will always blink first but they the russian elite have all their money in the west they get very depressed if they are mistreated in the french ski resort of courchevel
7802469 cameron was very good he really got the value side of it very well
7802470 they want to get rid of this government and undermine georgian independence their aim is to get a normal government subordinate to them it would send a very powerful message
7802471 they the russians have fought a war by proxy with nato its about great russia coming back and confronting the horrible west that humiliated russia
7802472 i never had any personal hatred towards him apparently he did towards me
7802473 we are now controlling most of the key government offices to prevent them from coming to work
7802474 today we declare a long long holiday for the government
7802475 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7802476 natos mission is based on a un mandate and carried upon the invitation of the afghan government
7802477 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7802478 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7802479 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7802480 we think the vast majority of dispensaries in california will be in compliance
7802481 they want to see if there is any interest there
7802482 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7802483 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7802484 we are going to go forward with the players that we have
7802485 and we are always looking for and searching for people who can help our team and nothing is going to change with regard to that
7802486 i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7802487 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7802488 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7802489 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre
7802490 he has been pretty happy we saw him up here and he said he missed it but he was content he has decided to go on to the next phase of his life so i dont look too strongly into that him playing again
7802491 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7802492 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat

7802504 why write it in such a way that it comes off as
7802505 last year the mets had a big lead and i think they kind of thought they were a much better team than us
7802506 this year all the games have been close even though theyre 9 4 against us its been close we know were definitely capable of beating them
7802507 we only got to enjoy being in first place for one day
7802508 then it was three and out that kind of sticks with you
7802509 even if we feel we can beat them weve got to play them good weve got to play them better than they do these are big games for us big opportunities
7802510 its very hard not to think about the olympic games very difficult to refocus

7802525 this is an issue of having community leaders come to an agreement
7802526 was inspired by partisan divisions inside the broadcasting board of governors
7802527 to resist economic pressures to make additional cuts which could remove it from the top ranks of american journalism

7802537 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
7802538 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive

7802556 the games are just as you would think a fourth grade kickball game would go except that four women must be on the field at all times and our games have official a s a umpires
7802557 as we play at penn state harrisburg we cannot drink on campus and would never do so
7802558 it is kickball so its not like you have to be in shape to play although i will point out round is a shape
7802559 we are looking to continually grow but the main issue right now is finding large enough fields with lights that will let us play
7802560 we have had some trouble making people aware of who we are and making sure they know that we arent going to destroy their fields
7802561 im just gonna speak to simon the way i speak to everybody
7802562 im just gonna have my opinion be honest and i dont foresee any problems im really excited about this and up for the challenge
7802563 its really flattering too you know to think that idol even thought about me
7802564 i mean when i got the call i thought they were calling the wrong person so im the new kid on the block and im hoping everyones gonna go easy on me and that i bring a lot to the table
7802565 im maybe not a household name but people know of me in the industry
7802566 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7802567 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7802568 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7802569 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7802570 id say i believe in what i believe in and im willing to fight for it and im pretty feisty
7802571 that when their song comes on the radio i know exactly who it is its not about vocal acrobatics
7802572 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong stand alone value proposition for shareholders

7802576 i will be telling my delegates that i will vote for barack obama
7802577 how they vote is a more personal decision they want to have their chance to vote for me that is what traditionally happens some people are having to make up their minds because there are arguments pulling them both ways
7802578 there are going to be some of senator clintons supporters we are going to have to work hard to persuade to come on board
7802579 some are adjusting some are hardcore but some just have a colour issue
7802580 they like his issues they like his ideas but hes a black man its as simple as that
7802581 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7802582 i will vote for hillary until she releases her delegates and then i will just as proudly put my support behind barack obama
7802583 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7802584 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7802585 there is no way some of those people were going to be satisfied no matter who you picked or what you did
7802586 my family had a party planned for me it would have been so much fun
7802587 in 2000 sydney was a chance for me to exper ience the games to learn
7802588 and 2004 was my dream come true but at these games i had new challenges and this was a success for me not a failure
7802589 in a way there was more pressure being an olympic champ

7802771 crops which have been genetically engineered to date include maize soya beans canola derived from rapeseed and potatoes many biotech companies would like to genetically engineer wheat if this is pushed through the question will arise as to whether gm wheat can be used in the eucharist
7802772 the bread must be wheaten only and recently made so that there is no danger of corruption
7802773 for example people who suffer coeliac disease are unable to absorb gluten a protein found in wheat eating even small amounts of wheat can make them ill
7802774 in recent decades it has been possible to extract the gluten from wheaten bread so that people can eat bread without endangering their health despite the fact that gluten wheat poses a health threat which can often be serious the congregation of the doctrine of the faith stated in a reply in 1982 that the local ordinary could not permit a priest to consecrate special gluten free hosts for the communion of coeliacs
7802775 special hosts quibus glutinum ablatum est from which gluten has been removed are invalid matter for the celebration of the eucharist
7802776 given the centrality of the celebration of the eucharist in the life of the priest candidates for the priesthood who are affected by coeliac disease or suffer from alcoholism or similar conditions may not be admitted to holy orders
7802777 genetically engineered wheat will have an added protein which will make it tolerant to the herbicide of a biotech company
7802778 this raises questions whether it is lawful to use gm wheat as matter for the eucharist if notwithstanding a pressing health need the congregation of the doctrine of the faith refused to sanction gluten free hosts as valid matter for the eucharist because a protein has been extracted from the wheat how can it sanction genetically engineered wheat which has an added protein designed to make it resistant to a weed killer

7802792 de zoekresultaten krijgen hiermee een rating als je het wilt delen dan stuur je het naar je vrienden
7802793 vrienden geven vervolgens ook aan of het wel of niet interessant is vindt iemand het niet interessant dan komt het sleutelwoord op de blacklist voor die ene persoon
7802794 het idee hierachter is dat je vroeger maar die zenders had waar je de dag later gewoon met je vrienden over kon praten met internet heb je tegenwoordig een overvloed aan informatie vrienden zijn vaak wel ge nteresseerd in dezelfde dingen dus dat moet je kunnen delen met elkaar
7802795 google meet op het aantal linkts en op hoeveel mensen daarop klikken dat is een grote groep met je vrienden zoek je misschien alleen naar je plaatselijke voetbalclub je kan dus specifiekere resultaten tonen vrienden zoeken vaak naar wat jij ook interessant vindt in zoekmachines is het moeilijk om een profiel op te bouwen op informatie met de applicatie gebruiken we het natuurlijke element van sociale netwerken
7802796 is that it violates a lot of classic principles yet it succeeds in delivering the necessary functions in a contextual and compact way
7802797 when the user mouses over a book a contextual popup comes up containing information about the book and a set of associated actions part of the popup is a button menu sort of like a button and combo box widget that allows the user to provide information about what he or she did with the book the first thing to note is that combination of a button in a menu is not standard yet it makes sense because it saves a click for the most important action secondly the menu is effectively a popup within a popup which is a big no no in the classic world but works well in this context the elements of the menu are not buttons but check boxes which allow multiple selection another violation of classic user interface elements but which works very well in this context what is remarkable is how intuitive this gadget is you are interacting with it in the context of a book and each choice is simple and clear such clarity and simplicity was never present in the old interfaces clearly this new approach to uis is great and early adopters are loving it but will it cross over to the mainstream
7802798 amazon can make shelfari the choice of casual book lovers who see a button on amazon com and click on it
7802799 the population of the country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
7802800 if we treat all of the lettuce and spinach then theres going to be a very rare instance of exposure to illness causing microorganisms
7802801 whats sad is that the fda after a nearly nine year review selected only two products involved with the massive illnesses in 2007
7802802 i suspect it will take awhile for the supply chain to get into place because of the limited number of irradiation facilities in place in the u s
7802803 these facilities are relatively expensive to build so you have to make sure you have adequate product flow and a market for that product
7802804 it would have to be new construction thats for sure
7802805 we wouldnt expect any immediate adoption and in fact industry wont move forward unless they are sure there wont be a backlash from consumer activists the other issue is that there is a lot more product now being labeled organic and you cannot irradiate products labeled organic
7802806 theres been a lot of research done on that and basically products that have treated with irradiation are as good or better after 14 days typical travel time than those that havent
7802807 we now know that in order to kill e coli on this type of product we can turn down the dosage level the power of the beam effectively and lettuce and spinach remain just as crisp and wholesome as if you grew it yourself
7802808 the american consumer has shown willingness to purchase irradiated products such as strawberries and meats once consumers understand the food safety implications their unfounded worries about the safety of the cold pasteurization process are eliminated even though there are a lot of naysayers and anti irradiation people giving inaccurate information
7802809 the experience with ground beef is that consumers have not reacted negatively to the label
7802810 the only negative reaction is to price it costs more
7802811 in 2007 there were an estimated 50 billion servings of green leafy salads served in this country and there were approximately 1 200 people made ill
7802812 the odds of getting a food borne illness from produce are already extremely low based upon the number of servings that we see but what we have to recognize is that irradiation is one more tool we can use to ensure the safety of our products this is especially important for at risk populations immune compromised folks pregnant women children under the age of eight and elderly these people are at high risk for food borne illness and it may be useful to feed them greens that have been irradiated for that last margin of safety
7802813 the real importance of this rule is that produce companies wouldnt even look at the technology unless the government approved it the new fda rule makes them more inclined to take a fresh look at it

7802818 we were both astounded at the breadth and depth peter bolzs display was especially surprising with several mandan and hidatsa buffalo robes that just blew us away
7802819 public figures like michael phelps exert a major influence over our youngsters
7802820 mr phelps is a superior athlete by any measure but his judgment regarding the mcdonalds and kelloggs frosted flakes endorsements was either 1 ill advised by his handlers 2 the irrational product of too much blood sugar or 3 a sad triumph of greed over good ciof believes that celebrities should think twice before choosing to endorse or encourage the consumption of any product which is inherently unhealthful to children especially if that product is correlated to obesity diabetes and a myriad of dangerous conditions
7802821 octagon sports agent peter carlisle is making a strategic branding mistake by aligning michael phelps to kelloggs frosted flakes and mcdonalds in this era of escalating child obesity and diabetes the last association michael phelps wants is that of junk food pusher
7802822 while michael phelps may consume thousands of calories a day and burn them off through olympic training americas kids arent so fat sickly and have little hope of accomplishing a single sit up much less olympic gold kids are watching and michael phelps going for the quick cash of pushing junk food at the expense of children tarnishes his image similar to an association with cigarettes or alcohol would national action against obesity and the childrens international obesity foundation implore michael phelps and all celebrities and athletes to reject offers to push more sugar fat and hazardous calories onto americas kids
7802823 as we set out to look at the causes of obesity in our film
7802824 this is unconscionable and we hope that michael phelps reconsiders his endorsement contracts
7802825 because children under five deserve environments full of healthy options not marketing venues for junk food producers

7802829 the bottom line is that we dont have enough information
7802830 we know that more children are diagnosed today than in the past
7802831 a lot of it is the change in what we call autism but we cant say that explains all of it
7802832 we certainly get indications that autism exists in other communities of the world but whether it exists to the same degree as common its not quite as clear

7802856 some good performances in this a tour will certainly be looked at by national selectors
7802857 the first tour match is at bangalore where the first test is going to be played and the second tour match is in hyderabad so both will be good opportunities for us to perform well and put our hands up for selection
7802858 the one thing about this tour is that it is about getting the rust out of the system and trying to perform well after a break
7802859 it is a perfect opportunity for us to go out there and just try and get back into playing mode
7802860 congratulations to michael phelps for winning eight olympic gold medals i applaud him and his mother for speaking about ad hd mr phelps shows that its possible to go beyond coping with ad hd and truly achieve his candor addresses stigma and hopefully will inspire others to seek help
7802861 its important for people living with ad hd to pursue interests they enjoy and at which they excel
7802862 phelpss success demonstrates that being a part of a supportive family setting goals engaging in enjoyable activities and receiving positive feedback are all important in building self esteem phelps is clearly an exceptionally talented athlete and a source of pride for the millions of people affected by ad hd
7802863 among men there is a deep stigma associated with seeking treatment for ad hd i hope that michael phelpss openness conveys to young men that its okay to seek treatment that it is part of a wise game plan
7802864 its obvious to everyone who watched the olympic games that mr phelps has an engaged supportive and enthusiastic family who helped him find his right fit with swimming
7802865 the magnetom trio enables us to study in great depth the brain functionality of volunteers
7802866 ongoing studies at the cbu will help to increase understanding of the brain leading to developments in the clinical side of neuroscience in the long term it will contribute to early diagnosis and create a better understanding of neuropathologies helping to improve outcomes care management and quality of life
7802867 thanks to the advances in mri technology and extensive research we have gained invaluable insight into the nature of vegetative state patients
7802868 our studies in healthy volunteers have been 100 accurate when looking for responses to yes and no questions which has enormous implications for the way conditions such as the vegetative state are assessed understanding these patients is vital for accurate diagnosis as well as for providing information to friends and relatives accurate neural maps open the door to a new type of communication meaning researchers can reach even greater depths of understanding into this condition
7802869 the pace of mri innovation is assisting not only clinical establishments but also research institutions in understanding the way the brain works mri yields detailed images of reactions and neurological functions in patients and healthy subjects this provides physicians and scientists with evidence of reactions that can go towards developing swifter diagnosis and improved care programmes

7802895 there will be major and potentially dangerous consequences if services such as health and education are provided centrally as it will be difficult to protect the most vulnerable prisoners from those who might cause them harm
7802896 most of our boards favour smaller units and have negative experience of large establishments and clustering of prisons to achieve efficiency but at the cost of effective rehabilitation
7802897 we shall continue to emphasise and carry out our task of monitoring fairness and respect wherever people are imprisoned and point out the major disadvantages of prisons of a size that present serious management problems

7802940 we continue to find the way to reach an agreement between israel and the palestinians
7802941 very heartened by the fact that the negotiations are serious and they are intensive
7802942 in fact i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7802943 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7802944 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7802945 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7802946 but at the end of the day the israeli governments policy is not to expand settlements not to build new settlements and not to confiscate palestinian land
7802947 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future of the future borders of the palestinian state
7802948 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and that anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7802949 and we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is palestinian
7802950 subdued economic prospects and the expectation of additional price hikes continued to depress consumer sentiment
7802951 the german economy is encountering an increasingly more difficult situation
7802952 are markedly more sceptical with regard to the six month outlook
7802953 as slightly positive and the outlook is assessed less critically
7802954 one thing has become crystal clear the german consumer is no match for the rapid slowdown of the global economy
7802955 consumers are not interpreting the marked decrease in crude oil prices as an all clear signal when it comes to purchasing power
7802956 the turnaround in the index lately is a worrying sign that the economy is slowing fast

7802963 the australian high commissioner in nairobi is working closely with the senior members of the somali government to seek mr brennans release
7802964 the somali government has informed us they are using every channel to persuade the kidnappers to release the hostage unconditionally
7802965 we are also in contact with foreign governments with interests in somalia and un agencies in somalia to seek their cooperation and assistance
7802966 we dont know who kidnapped them there is a rebel group which kidnaps for ransom separate from rivals who have political objectives
7802967 we shall do all that is possible to save them
7802968 our travel advice for somalia cautions australians against any travel to somalia and warns of the very high risk of terrorist attack violent crime and kidnapping
7802969 there have been several recent kidnappings of foreign nationals in somalia
7802970 they are beside themselves and feeling helpless but they are trying to stay positive

7802979 the beauty of this and the adjustment of the fees is that everybody who is eligible gets a place theres none of this where some people pay 877 and other people pay 8 000 a year for full private cost recovery

7802981 some fees will stay the same and others will rise in line with the expected job opportunities and wage outcomes from engaging in one of those qualifications

7802987 in the clash one kidnapper was also wounded and efforts are under way to release the japanese
7802988 ryanair confirms that the fr9336 from bristol airport to barcelona girona airport on the evening of august 25 experienced an inflight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy
7802989 as a safety precaution the captain descended and diverted the aircraft to limoges airport at approximately 23 30 local french time
7802990 all 168 passengers disembarked safely upon landing a total of 16 passengers together with five accompanying family members have transferred at their request to a local hospital complaining of ear ache
7802991 suddenly there was a roar of wind a rush of cold air the oxygen masks dropped you didnt know what was going on
7802992 no oxygen was delivered through the oxygen masks and i was surprised there seemed to be no communication between the pilot and the flight attendants because they didnt seem to know what to say and do
7802993 there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear
7802994 passengers sometimes misunderstand they expect a surge of oxygen when in actual fact there is a steady stream of oxygen
7802995 the oxygen masks were working and the correct procedures were followed as soon as the captain got the plane down to 8 000 ft he did make the appropriate announcement that they were going to divert to limoges for safety reasons
7802996 this is always a traumatic experience for passengers but the crew dealt with it appropriately

7803002 and in the second set i just tell myself ok right now you just play your game dont give up i know every first round is tough for the player so i just try my best
7803003 it was a great win i think because hes a good player and seeded
7803004 i didnt think i was going to win so im happy of it

7803021 pursuant to a review of the companys performance in the first half and the expectations for the second half the companys profit before tax for the year to 31 december 2008 will fall short of current market expectations
7803022 the shortfall in profits can principally be attributed to demands placed on the business by the transaction and a slower than expected improvement in the sales momentum of the combined entity

7803243 they made the road to the airport signal free but what about us pedestrians how are we supposed to cross the road besides the condition of footpaths is so bad that we are forced to walk on the road
7803244 every month at least one pedestrian is killed on this road vehicles are always going at full speed at nights the road are not illuminated making it difficult for both pedestrians and drivers
7803245 some times people do not listen to the security guard i have a tough time crossing the road the footpaths have telephone boxes and poles to facilitate ads which makes walking tough
7803246 it is very difficult to cross the road there is heavy traffic all the time and not enough zebra crossings
7803247 the footpaths are dug up and nobody seems in any hurry to fix them in some places there is no footpath at all and crossing the road is very difficult if other well frequented roads were in the same condition there would have been a hue and cry
7803248 three years ago the government had wide footpath made but now there are shops on them i had written to the bbmp commissioner and to the additional commissioner of traffic but there has been no response from them i even made a five page report on all the encroachments but they still did not bother

7803292 everyones been getting word that were crazy and our fans are even crazier
7803293 were pros were not out to kill anyone there are some promoters who have refused to book us because of the type of music we play and how crazy we can make our fans
7803294 it was a very nice christian venue so with the content of those banned photos i could see why they initially had a problem with us it was because of our fans though that they were willing to listen to us and we ended up playing the show after all
7803295 maybe its time to start living up to peoples expectations and become a truly deadly band

7803324 the dollar remains in favor as the week progresses with worse than expected german consumer confidence data this morning being the latest driver to buoy the greenback
7803325 the ongoing economic slowdown is certainly dampening consumer appetite and this will lead to further calls for the european central bank to adopt a more accommodative approach over its monetary policy although the ongoing threat of high inflation could well ensure that rate cuts remain limited over the next 12 months

7803341 there will be major and potentially dangerous consequences if services such as health and education are provided centrally as it will be difficult to protect the most vulnerable prisoners from those who might cause them harm
7803342 most of our boards favour smaller units and have negative experience of large establishments and clustering of prisons to achieve efficiency but at the cost of effective rehabilitation
7803343 we shall continue to emphasise and carry out our task of monitoring fairness and respect wherever people are imprisoned and point out the major disadvantages of prisons of a size that present serious management problems
7803344 these will be prison complexes prisons within prisons and one of the benefits of having these large prisons is that we will be able for example to have better health care facilities
7803345 above all these prisons will be built in the areas of greatest pressure so the prisons will be much nearer to prisoners families than the prisoners are at the moment
7803346 the consultation is still under way and the government welcomes the imbs contribution to the debate these new titan prison complexes will not be warehouses prisoners will be accommodated in small units capable of addressing their needs and offending behaviour
7803347 the complexes will also be situated close to those areas which generate the greatest volume of offenders therefore ensuring that important family and other links can be maintained

7803350 escaped some time this morning while under the supervision of an officer
7803351 i just turn around and run and i call doctor
7803352 said no sense paying a guard and things getting thief so he fired him
7803353 doctor was not too pleased but he felt sorry for him and allowed him
7803354 hang around so when he left doctor just hire him
7803355 but he would keep in contact with his family because sometimes he would tell me that he sell orange from his brother because he had a farm and the other day he said that his sister came in the country and he went and see her

7803359 if one believes he has what it takes to run a successful business then thats where he should invest his money the key is to let their hard earned money work overtime
7803360 i have severe hearing damage its manifested itself as tinnitus ringing in the ears at frequencies that i play guitar it hurts its painful and its frustrating
7803361 it is important that when the club has done something good for you that you do something good for the club
7803362 the reason i left bayern is because i didnt get the minutes i wish i had
7803363 the lads here give me the confidence to believe that my body is 100 per cent okay and to play as well as i used to
7803364 now im very relaxed and confident that this season can be as good as the last one especially because i feel good in training
7803365 for me it was always clear before signing the deal i had three years to go with blackburn so the club were the ones deciding what happens with my future
7803366 they understand that im very ambitious but what they offer is the chance for me to become a better player
7803367 thats the reason i came here in the beginning so thats the reason also that i signed the new deal
7803368 this is an important year for the club having changed the manager and with people coming in who want to be as successful as the last ones
7803369 im aware of both situations im here to help the club and i think everybody in the team understands the situation and thats why im very happy that everything is done
7803370 i signed a contract because im sure it is the right choice
7803371 i know people say its about timing and that when you are in good shape you need to go to a better team or whatever
7803372 but i think because of everything that has happened to me in the past i need to keep going here and performing as good as last year
7803373 this is a big thing for me it is a goal for me to be involved in a team that wants to become a good side
7803374 when i came here we played in the uefa cup after finishing 10th but last season we finished seventh and we are not in europe so it can sometimes be successful to finish 10th
7803375 as long as we are in europe that is needed to be a successful club of course we need to go as far as possible and maybe have more points than last season

7803384 what i like about this particular dvd is that its not too loud or boisterous
7803385 the thing i most appreciate about the dvd something i havent seen other educational dvds do is that it shows the words in a variety of colors sizes and positions on the screen its not just a slide show of a static word moving across the tv its trying to help kids recognize a pattern of letters in a dynamic environment after all not every book a child reads is going to be in the same font not every presentation of the letter a is going to look the same
7803386 my two year old did repeat the words with the narrator and seemed entertained but like most two year olds she checked out after 15 minutes

7803393 the german economy is encountering an increasingly more difficult situation
7803394 are markedly more sceptical with regard to the six month outlook
7803395 as slightly positive and the outlook is assessed less critically
7803396 one thing has become crystal clear the german consumer is no match for the rapid slowdown of the global economy
7803397 the turnaround in the index lately is a worrying sign that the economy is slowing fast
7803398 hillary often says that bill isnt a complicated person the obama people dont have to do much to make peace with him
7803399 this is hard hard in the most human kind of way theres no doubt about it
7803400 someday the clintons and mr obama may become good friends for now this is a hard human process making room on the stage for everyone
7803401 kennedys embrace of obama was in part about seeing personal qualities in obama that he saw in his brothers
7803402 for the clintons who were in and out power much more recently it is more complicated
7803403 police will use all means to restore normalcy as soon as possible
7803404 the military will not allow them to take control of the country however it is not the time yet for military force
7803405 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
7803406 the government has given them a lot of time and now government restraint is almost over
7803407 i ask all the protesters who have been blockading or occupying government offices that you still have a chance to withdraw and go back to your homes
7803408 jonas has got it in him to be thought of every bit as much as david ginola
7803409 he is a different player so he will establish himself in a different way
7803410 jonas has got it in him to be thought of every bit as much as david ginola but in a different way definitely
7803411 he has got so many assets he is not just one thing or two things he has got loads more
7803412 im feeling really confident just now regardless of what happened in beijing
7803413 i feel im hitting the ball well i feel mentally strong and physically im not tired so i want to do well here and today was a good start
7803414 i think before you get out on the court there is always maybe more nerves in the first round maybe by the second third fourth rounds you get used to the court
7803415 no one wants to go out in the first round but actually once you get onto the court and you play sort of four five six games you get more comfortable and you relax a little bit

7803474 as a council the problem we have with him is over polio immunisation as the man and his followers do not take traditional or modern medicine for any illness but have their own ways of dealing with it

7803476 the dup have singularly failed in delivering a vibrant and sustainable rural planning policy former doe minister arlene foster chickened out of making decision on rural planning when she had an opportunity to address the needs of the rural west
7803477 her successor as environment minister sammy wilson should immediately publish a rural planning policy that meets the needs of the people of this district
7803478 citizens of this rural county have suffered enough because of this moratorium on rural planning we need to see a rural planning policy that meets the needs of the rural dweller both farmer and non farmer alike
7803479 the needs of the non farmer which makes up some 60 of the rural population must be properly addressed
7803480 much like in the u s the european venture industry is experiencing great softness in the ipo and m amp a markets and this is putting a damper on deal flow
7803481 in particular health care companies which have seen the pipeline of ipos dry up over the last year posted their worst quarter on record were seeing a similar downward trend for health care companies in the u s where investment has fallen off 31 in the first six months of the year
7803482 there is a silver lining in this quarters figures and its that we are seeing early stage deals make up a greater percentage of deal activity in europe
7803483 venture capitalists are being very selective about the companies they back but theyre by no means abandoning the european market in the first six months of the year 44 of venture deals in europe were seed or first rounds we havent seen this level of early stage interest since the first half of 2001

7803526 this is a club that has not paid winning bonuses to players for more than two seasons and yet they create the impression that by sacking everything will be well
7803527 they should be putting the interest of the players first
7803528 in a way i am happy this has happened when you play for hearts of oak everyone feels you must be doing good when in truth you are in constant financial stress he complained now i can move on to something better to a club where i will be treated fairly
7803529 they said they are letting us go after an appraisal but they can never use poor form as an excuse the fans know the management knows and the technical men know i was a very good goalkeeper
7803530 it is the reason they looked for me every time there was a hearts kotoko game around because they know they could count on me in the big moments
7803531 i did full scale training last week but the doctors advised that i rest for another week
7803532 we have signed carlo for one year with an option for another year we saw a lot of positives in his game while he was training with us and he brings with him the kind of experience that will help us up front
7803533 were happy for patrick hes a good man he is from port elizabeth so we really wanted to move him close to home for the last part of his career its worked out well
7803534 i have fully recovered from a knee injury after the successful operation i had i have been training on my own for a couple of weeks now and soon i will be ready to start looking for a new team my primary focus is regaining my fitness and i will then take it from there
7803535 i know it will be tough but we have to go there and try for three points
7803536 and that would be a very happy day for me against my old club and of course for the coach too since gordon left ajax he hasnt managed to beat them
7803537 we must go there and play our own game i know how tough it will be but i also know everyone in the ajax team and how the coach will prepare the side but they dont know anything about maritzburg united so i think weve got a 50 50 chance
7803538 our preparation has gone well the only thing is that there are a lot of players who only arrived here in the last two weeks
7803539 tico tico has only trained with us for two or three days so its going to be difficult for us to come together as a team but we have a lot of experienced players to compete with
7803540 maybe though we will only be a strong team in one months time we have two weeks between playing ajax and our next game against kaizer chiefs in durban and i think by then we will be strong enough
7803541 he is a coach who likes talking to the players if he wants players to do something in training he knows how to explain it to them

7803570 by pioneering new business models the pc has quietly remained the single leading platform for games not only in terms of consumer usage but revenue generation the most fascinating thing about pc gaming is its ability to attract such a diverse audience both demographically and geographically the real key has been the rapid growth in penetration of broadband connected pcs in all markets around the world broadband connected pcs are the key driver of growth for pc gaming dfc intelligence estimated that by the end of 2007 less than one third of households in the top 20 markets for games had a high speed internet connection that clearly indicates that there is still plenty of growth to come

7803579 numbers have been creeping up for several years especially among young children
7803580 the bottom line is that we dont have enough information
7803581 we know that more children are diagnosed today than in the past
7803582 a lot of it is the change in what we call autism but we cant say that explains all of it
7803583 we certainly get indications that autism exists in other communities of the world but whether it exists to the same degree as common its not quite as clear

7803595 manchester velodrome has been fantastic it was the first stage of it all for me
7803596 if it did not exist then i am sure british cycling would not be where it is today
7803597 it was incredible overwhelming really i did not expect it at all when you are in the olympic village you are in a bubble but this was amazing
7803598 hopefully the success the whole team has had can get the whole nation behind the games in london were looking forward to it
7803599 you all know something the government will spend money on them and on the olympics but they will take money away from other sports to pay for this they could put a lot money into the olympics by pulling out of iraq and afghanistan stop allowing so many asylum seekers to stay in the country for no reason and stop all this wiping the backsides of the do gooders of the world and stand on our feet and say to the world we are great britain
7803600 this is a very real tragedy and our condolences go the family of claire i have met them today and there is no doubt they are devastated by the events that have taken claire from them
7803601 we are continuing to find out how claire came to be in the water that night and would repeat my appeal for anyone who may have seen claire near to the sea wall near to the metropole to come forward
7803602 afghanistan was not somewhere i expected to be lying down in six inches of snow it did gradually get hotter and was up to 40 degrees in kabul i enjoyed the tour you could see that the people there know you are there to look after them keeping the insurgents away i am happy that i have done it
7803603 patrols are my favourite part of the tour you get to see people and they all want to talk to you and ask where you are from i was stunned one day when i met a man who had been living with his family in bury where my ta centre is small world
7803604 normally if he gets a happy meal he just goes straight for his toy but this time hed eaten half the food first then i looked in the box and found this bag with a powdered substance in it
7803605 elijah cant read and could have opened it and then eaten it im concerned he could have eaten a dangerous substance and it bothers me that he ate the food that was on top of it the packet says it should be disposed of as hazardous waste all the toys are wrapped in bags which are quite similar to this sachet he could ended in hospital and i might not have had a clue what it was
7803606 we have rigorous procedures in place to ensure that incidents of this nature do not occur we apologise that in this isolated incident our usual standards do not appear to have been met and for any distress this has caused the safety of our customers and our food is of paramount importance and we have launched an urgent investigation
7803607 whenever they dig out that picture of hindley it sends shivers down my spine and the fact its made from childrens handprints just kills me
7803608 when that picture first came out i was invited to go and see it in london but i couldnt bear to go in the room where it was if id have seen that picture up close i would have put their windows in
7803609 to use this image to promote the olympic games to send this image all over the world is disgusting i watched the olympics from beginning to end and thought it was wonderful and that if i got the money i would go to 2012 i wont now because of this
7803610 it seems silly anyway because myra hindley is a manchester woman and nothing to do with london maybe thats why its happened because those in london dont know how strongly manchester people feel about this

7803622 such a program will cater for the very basic needs in form of information and education for seafarers when it comes to hiv aids

7803630 my wife and i thought of this when we were trying to come up with something new for the business we wondered what is the best theme car we could have

7803637 our monitoring shows the start of a change in driving patterns and behaviour
7803638 average motorway speeds have reduced as well as congestion which indicates a reduction in the volume of vehicles especially lorries
7803639 one explanation is that rising fuel prices and economic concerns are making people think about how they drive
7803640 the fall in congestion is good news in an otherwise bleak picture
7803641 but this altered pattern of demand can only be a breathing space for policymakers and does not remove the case for investment in congestion busting measures

7803651 one thing has become crystal clear the german consumer is no match for the rapid slowdown of the global economy

7803683 some perspective on the policy arguments between the mccain and obama camps
7803684 want the federal government making decisions for consumers or for providers
7803685 like other democrats he was pushing for a big government program to deal with what he saw as market failures in health care and to bring down the price of insurance
7803686 program was in place though he trusted a market of individuals to make its own decisions once the government had subsidized health insurance he thought the vast majority of the uninsured would sign up
7803687 find traction in the presidential race where health care remains a large issue
7803688 give both candidates a spring board to tout their very different health care plans
7803689 move some money from here to there cut some government waste no one apparently ever noticed and then fund an unattainable promise with an outlandish price tag
7803690 totes up dubious savings to fund his ultimate goal of making health insurance affordable to everyone
7803691 obamas own web site points out that health insurance premiums have risen six times faster than wages in the last four years
7803692 to be sure there are many laudable goals in obamas plan
7803693 improve the nations health and may moderate if not lower long term health care costs
7803694 near term price tag is clearly being underestimated to make the medicine go down a little easier
7803695 promises to provide every american access to affordable comprehensive health care and to achieve long overdue mental health and addiction treatment parity
7803696 thats right the dems will expand the number of people who receive subsidized health care provide better benefits and you apparently dont have to worry about costs going up
7803697 dems are going to eliminate waste in the medical system they will save the typical family up to 2 500 per year

7803699 then the platform promises a return to fiscal responsibility really
7803700 suggestion that mr obama is all rhetorical fluff is mistaken
7803701 place him at almost any point on the democratic political spectrum
7803702 era of big government would not be over in an obama administration
7803703 stigma associated with hiv aids is very very strong here
7803704 remains idle because the local community believe they cannot contract the disease
7803705 we need an aggressive awareness campaign in these remote areas
7803706 we have no picture or poster of a condom here we cannot take the risk
7803707 culture does not allow me to advise or discuss any sexual matter with a woman who is older than me
7803708 epidemiologists track infections in something much closer to real time than was previously possible
7803709 their ability to say that theyre going to have ongoing reliable reports of hiv incidence is somewhat questionable unless you have funding for that
7803710 tak e aim at rival hiv drugs hinting at side effects and other drawbacks
7803711 with images of hope and by explaining the benefits of their treatments
7803712 tough new tack has some patient groups unsettled saying it could scare off patients
7803713 dont take a chance stick with the hiv medicine thats working for you
7803714 will the hiv medicine make my skin or eyes turn yellow
7803715 while we acknowledge that some people may find the headline and imagery of the materials to be provocative gsk stands firmly behind the ads and their underlying message patients considering changing hiv therapy ought to consult closely with their physician to fully understand the near and potential long term health implications of such changes
7803716 just as likely to encourage a patient to stay with another medicine as it is one of our own assuming that the medicine is working for a patient and is well tolerated
7803717 ends this september and as always we will take all the community feedback we have received into consideration for future campaigns
7803718 ask your doctor if there are hiv medications with a low risk of diarrhea
7803719 kaletra has a well established side effect profile and profound and sustained effectiveness in combating hiv
7803720 market for hiv medicines has grown crowded and companies want to protect their market share
7803721 treatments have become so comparable so companies are really trying to split hairs to have a marketing advantage
7803722 it may be possible to slow the rise of xdr tb deaths
7803723 by ensuring that patients are correctly diagnosed as early as possible and put on appropriate treatment for the correct length of time
7803724 extremely labor and resource intensive and has to be done within extremely well structured tb programs
7803725 the reason we have the problem is inadequate control of tb
7803726 aggressive treatment of xdr tb is the logical strategy to provide the best chance of treatment success while avoiding the creation of additional drug resistance
7803727 should be cautious in their hope to attain such success rates in settings with a high prevalence of hiv
7803728 it appears that significant comprehensive reform would not begin until september 2010
7803729 mutate to become resistant to combination treatments so evolving newer combinations increases the life of the drug used
7803730 situation is changing fast with doctors having to frequently change the combination of drugs
7803731 still makes chloroquine the medicine of choice to treat malaria patients
7803732 problem of morbidity with relapses in p vivax malaria is of great concern
7803733 it is shocking the sangh parivar should use this as an opportunity to further its violent agenda of attacking the minority community
7803734 reflection of the fascistic mindset of these organisations that they could attack a place housing innocent unprotected children
7803735 the wild gene of yak is thus very important for future genetic studies for diseases resistance etc

7803742 im quite a bob dylan fan but lets face it who isnt we decided the dylan festival would be the perfect end to our summer programme
7803743 we have acts coming from all over the uk and as ireland to perform at the event
7803744 it goes to show how much appeal dylan still has
7803745 the government does so much to bring back israelis thrown into dangerous situations abroad like what happened in georgia when two planes were sent to evacuate innocent israeli tourists sending a text message is a good idea and it wouldnt cost them a thing because the phones owner pays the entire bill while abroad
7803746 i dont want you to speak hebrew to me there speak arabic or french if you can
7803747 of course im going to be more alert were going to turkey and its not the safest place on earth
7803748 we heard about the alert on the news it said to be careful of abductions and terrorist attacks
7803749 we dont intend to be alone and after dark in remote places and we plan to move from place to place by taxi
7803750 were originally from there and we know where its safe and where wed better not hang out we wouldnt have changed our plans because of the warning
7803751 no one told us about the alerts and we didnt take a cellular phone with us but we read on the internet about the alerts that hizbullah would attempt to abduct israelis
7803752 what good can come out of it it would ruin the vacation we live in constant fear so why reach us abroad too if something serious happens our parents will inform us
7803753 we already know we should be alert at all times not to walk alone and not to gather in groups this is all old news
7803754 but when we arrived there i calmed down the bulgarian people are very much like the israelis and the atmosphere there was relaxing
7803755 we rightly promote that it is morally wrong and illegal to drive a motor vehicle while impaired through drink or drugs
7803756 little attention however is given to the question of tiredness while driving a radical programme of education in this matter is required
7803757 it is not sufficient to flash a message on a motorway illuminated sign that tiredness kills drivers should be educated in the same manner as they are concerning drink driving
7803758 toby had just moved to sale with his fianc e jenny and everything in their lives was just right we cant bring toby back but we can try to stop it happening in future

7803760 we love you you have done well carry on the good work in the service of our father land
7803761 i will today forgive all those who went to court to bear false witnesses against me

7803763 luckily those who printed t shirts those who made wrapper campaigning have also gone on air to say they did not do so

7803767 a serious blot on the culture of democracy in our sub region
7803768 president mugabe would like to convey his heartfelt condolences on behalf of government and the people of zimbabwe

7803798 it is impossible to tell if the attack in peshawar was in retaliation to the ban but obviously it is worth asking if the taliban swiftly retaliated
7803799 the way these people are growing as a nuisance for pakistan there has to be a firm response

7803820 both supermarkets offer no frill mobile phones but asda has not done as well as
7803821 if there is a price war it will be between these two and will be similar to a price war on baked beans for example rather than the big mobile phone operators who gain their customers through brand perception
7803822 we know it is the overall value of the package not just the call and text rate that customers look at when deciding which provider to choose were confident we deliver unbeatable all round value

7803881 religion just like abortion is an individuals choice which they should let women make
7803882 in case such a pregnancy is aborted that amounts to murder based on this law we are therefore opposed to such blanket proposals

7803884 mps have no plans to pass a law that will encourage abortion
7803885 as fida we know that this is an emotive issue to us this bill has nothing to do with good or bad it is meant to uphold the right of women in making logical choices in life
7803886 it is not a matter of giving women the permission to decide whether to abort or not it is about legalising abortion to improve their physical and mental health

7803895 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7803896 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7803897 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
7803898 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together

7803938 the quality of it used varied greatly as did the sophistication and infrastructure
7803939 only one place heart of england nhs trust managed the golden idea of integrating dispensing an ip with the electronic patient record
7803940 thats really difficult to achieve for many places because they do not have fully operational integrated systems
7803941 the government intends to expand nhs choices so that it has a directory of quality accredited information a single sophisticated database covering all the long term conditions linked to care pathways and accessible by users and health professionals
7803942 the ideal plan is to create an ip generator that links to a national database and local systems one of the ways it could work is through a package such as emis or invision or in social care rio
7803943 we would like to work with system providers to develop an inforamtion prescription module within existing care records systems this would create a pop up screen that links to the national database and populates with information tailored to the patient
7803944 this could then be printed off or emailed to the patient
7803945 most opt in small scale locally driven and designed healthcare it projects succeed
7803946 a centrally designed and mandated project will be a success
7803947 talks were already underway with some gp system providers he added

7803950 there will be major and potentially dangerous consequences if services such as health and education are provided centrally as it will be difficult to protect the most vulnerable prisoners from those who might cause them harm
7803951 most of our boards favour smaller units and have negative experience of large establishments and clustering of prisons to achieve efficiency but at the cost of effective rehabilitation
7803952 we shall continue to emphasise and carry out our task of monitoring fairness and respect wherever people are imprisoned and point out the major disadvantages of prisons of a size that present serious management problems
7803953 these will be prison complexes prisons within prisons and one of the benefits of having these large prisons is that we will be able for example to have better health care facilities
7803954 above all these prisons will be built in the areas of greatest pressure so the prisons will be much nearer to prisoners families than the prisoners are at the moment
7803955 the consultation is still under way and the government welcomes the imbs contribution to the debate these new titan prison complexes will not be warehouses prisoners will be accommodated in small units capable of addressing their needs and offending behaviour
7803956 the complexes will also be situated close to those areas which generate the greatest volume of offenders therefore ensuring that important family and other links can be maintained
7803957 wir sehen zwar erste anzeichen f r einen wandel das ist aber noch nicht genug
7803958 between now and the next election we should tilt everything towards tower hamlets and birmingham and the rest of respect should see our task as mainly supporting them and being led by their agenda though we obviously need to continue to develop the small but important roots we have in places like manchester and bristol

7803960 will increase its war deterrent in every way as long as the u s and its followers continue posing military threats to it
7803961 the army and people of north korea will never remain an onlooker to the u s military and the south korean bellicose forces staging frantic anti north korea war moves
7803962 should the u s imperialists and their following forces misjudge north koreas will and act rashly
7803963 will mercilessly wipe out the aggressors to the last man
7803964 the people of santa cruz should rest assured that we will stop any minister arriving in santa cruz because they are not welcome
7803965 causing discontent among the officers predominately from bolivias largely indigenous west
7803966 the political effects of a radicalised position are not yet visible but they could be tremendously adverse for santa cruz

7803968 the debate on the referendum must not last beyond next week
7803969 if its through a law its a law if its by decree its a decree the new constitution has to be approved and we will ensure it is approved
7803970 if some groups do not want to understand the overwhelming sentiment of bolivian people the thoughts and suffering of the majorities then surely they will continue to reduce more and more in numbers and become more violent we have an obligation to ensure order so that there is respect between bolivians
7803971 we will not allow more outrages upon our institution and much less attacks on police officers

7803987 one of the girls is still traumatized from witnessing the attack
7803988 as of today our numbers of confirmed cases of this outbreak strain will include anyone who had this particular strain in their body at the time of death whether it was the actual cause of death or not
7803989 we fully expect that both the number of suspected and the number of confirmed cases will increase
7803990 of the 11 deaths in ontario six have been characterized as where the listeria bacteria has been an underlying or contributing factor in the death
7803991 five are still under investigation in terms of determining the extent of the contribution of the bacteria to the death of the individuals

7804032 however even though member states have made significant progress in making cultural content accessible on the internet more public and private investment is needed to speed up digitisation my goal is to have a european digital library called europeana and rich in content open to the public before the end of the year

7804084 in der georgischen krise geht es um mehr als um grundlegende fragen humanit rer bed rfnisse und die herrschaft des gesetzes ber die herrschaft der gewalt sie wirft die grundlegende frage auf ob und wenn ja wie russland in einem auf regeln basierenden internationalen politischen system eine verantwortungsvolle und rechtm ige rolle spielen kann in dem es zwar seine rechte wahrnimmt aber auch die der anderen respektiert

7804099 der westen k nnte eine anerkennung der unabh ngigkeit verhindern wenn er mit russlands hilfe rechtliche voraussetzungen f r die russische truppenpr senz schaffen w rde

7804101 jetzt ist russland st rker geworden es hat keine angst mehr vor einem konflikt mit dem westen
7804102 zugleich ist der westen nicht bereit georgiens pr sident michail saakaschwili einen harten schlag zu versetzen d h ihn zum kriegsverbrecher zu erkl ren oder ein waffenembargo f r georgien einzuf hren denn der westen geht davon aus dass russland f r ihn eine gefahr darstellt
7804103 deshalb m ssten die unabh ngigen regimes an russlands grenze stark sein
7804104 eine solche rechtsgrundlage w re die anerkennung der unabh ngigkeit
7804105 auf dieser grundlage k nnten zwischenstaatliche vertr ge ber die pr senz der russischen truppen geschlossen werden die anerkennung der unabh ngigkeit ist also in erster linie notwendig um vertr ge ber die truppenpr senz zu schlie en das ist wiederum notwendig um die abchasen und die osseten vor einer aggression des kriminellen regimes von saakaschwili zu sch tzen
7804106 es w rde einer anerkennung der unabh ngigkeit weiterhin eine andere rechtsgrundlage f r den schutz der einwohner abchasiens und s dossetiens vorziehen der appell der beiden russischen parlamentskammern an den pr sidenten russlands soll dem westen zeigen wie ernsthaft russland auf eine anerkennung der unabh ngigkeit abchasiens und s dossetiens eingestellt ist

7804154 is that it violates a lot of classic principles yet it succeeds in delivering the necessary functions in a contextual and compact way
7804155 when the user mouses over a book a contextual popup comes up containing information about the book and a set of associated actions part of the popup is a button menu sort of like a button and combo box widget that allows the user to provide information about what he or she did with the book the first thing to note is that combination of a button in a menu is not standard yet it makes sense because it saves a click for the most important action secondly the menu is effectively a popup within a popup which is a big no no in the classic world but works well in this context the elements of the menu are not buttons but check boxes which allow multiple selection another violation of classic user interface elements but which works very well in this context what is remarkable is how intuitive this gadget is you are interacting with it in the context of a book and each choice is simple and clear such clarity and simplicity was never present in the old interfaces clearly this new approach to uis is great and early adopters are loving it but will it cross over to the mainstream

7804220 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher

7804222 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind

7804259 no pact or an agreement should be set without being based on full sovereignty national common interests and no foreign soldier should remain on iraqi land and there should be a specific deadline and it should not be open
7804260 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7804261 any decisions on troops will be based on conditions on the ground in iraq
7804262 that has always been our position it continues to be our position
7804263 there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed there are discussions that continue in baghdad

7804266 as economic analysis the stern review dwells in a non scientific state of limbo
7804267 the orthodox capitalist reading of the economic is one which promotes competition and self interest over cooperation and mutual aid what are the implications of this when promoting social and economic sustainability

7804288 lots of room for exploring and in zachs case getting lost his best friend edwin mcmillan lived in our neighborhood and knew the way through the woods to our house and back but zachy as we called him then and now would always get lost coming and going from his friends house eventually someone would hear him crying and go to his rescue
7804289 this happened more than once but it seems to me that it was always a summer afternoon when our parents would pull out of the driveway with the three of us waving from the top of the hill with our arms around each other
7804290 once our parents car was out of sight greg turned into the devil he would throw zach into the shower with his clothes on
7804291 hes now not hes the sweetest person i know but id be sitting at the kitchen table and this is when i was going through puberty and hed get me up from the kitchen table hed take me outside and hed rip all my clothes off me until i was completely naked we lived on this grass hill and hed drag me up and down naked on this hill and hold me by the street until cars came by and they could see my naked body my brother really kind of designed me because i always thought his cruelty had a creative edge to it
7804292 my first gig was in the back of a hamburger restaurant in times square
7804293 i lied to myself a lot you can really do this then you just keep doing it i really loved it going out standing on bar stools with peoples backs turned to you and trying to tell jokes while they watch a hockey game in the background at least with music you dont need an instant feedback but with comedy if you dont have that laugh you dont have much to go on
7804294 words do not come to me easily but facial expressions are instant and involuntary for me
7804295 a funny thing happened to me on the way to the club tonight
7804296 and when i make horrible racist jokes thats because i think racism is so stupid that its funny
7804297 if people get it they get it ive also noticed that certain races are okay to make fun of and certain ones arent i used to have a joke about a chinese roommate and everyone would laugh at that joke but if i did more touchy things about people who had more representation in our culture
7804298 to be quite honest with you not a lot of chinese people go to comedy shows so i kept thinking why is it ok to say that i respect you if youre offended by all of it thats fine but dont be offended by one thing and think another is ok that just blows my mind ive tried to preach to audiences that are uptight but then ill do a joke that has the n word in it and black people are the first to laugh
7804299 one time i was like emile turn the tv off its time to do homework
7804300 hes seven years old and hes like no i dont want to do homework were watching beavis and butthead and i was like its time to do homework and i go up and i turn the tv off he turns it back on looks at me and says look you do what i say or im going to tell my mom youre touching my penis at that point i was like well i might as well touch his penis no i freaked out and realized i had to get out of this after that i quit nannying
7804301 i really wouldnt mind being a serious actor i dont know if i could pull it off but i think a lot of comedians really kind of want to be taken seriously sometimes and i feel im a bit guilty of that
7804302 when i go do acting jobs i really miss standup and when im on the road for a while i need to go act if im in an ashton kutcher movie here and there i know its really against my style but im not so elitist one day i hope to be that dont get me wrong id love to be so snobby
7804303 i remember working on it and i ask the production assistants what they were getting paid
7804304 people getting coffee were getting paid more than i was i liked that actually it made me feel good
7804305 my brother and i graduated from film programs at ucla wanting to make our own movies
7804306 like everyone else that goes to a film program we thought wed walk out with million dollar movie deals being placed in our laps that didnt happen so we decided to bum rush the playing field and shoot a feature for very little money in our parents back yard the point is we did it and were proud of it and however our dream evolves we will evolve with it aside from that we knew this dude that spontaneously exploded one day and thought it would be fun to make a comedy about him
7804307 like what am i doing a grown man its 3 45 in the morning im having trouble with my zipper and i have to ask one of the sound guys who was asleep to zip me up in the back but as soon as i step out im like ok this will be a lot of fun i didnt know what i was doing
7804308 my husband and i had no doubt zach would go wherever his dream would take him
7804309 when he was three or four years old he named his stuffed easter bunny john newman for john chancellor and edwin newman nbc nightly news co anchors around the same time he pointed to the tv screen and asked how do i get in there i guess we always knew he would eventually figure that out

7804331 all of them driven by the same conviction that drove my dad to get up an hour early each day to painstakingly dress himself for work the same conviction that drives the men and women ive met all across this country
7804332 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling
7804333 he and my mom poured everything they had into me and craig
7804334 and thanks to their faith and hard work we both were able to go on to college so i know firsthand from their lives and mine that the american dream endures
7804335 the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7804336 and in my own life in my own small way ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much

7804515 traditionally cultural awareness training was a brief introduction to the language culture customs and food this training while providing basic instruction in these areas did not provide the operational relevance required to conduct counterinsurgency warfare

7804563 at any operation no matter how well run will expose any existing problems
7804564 in the longer term the question is what is the credit profile that fha is taking on
7804565 somebody who has a 750 credit score and 20 down is not going to pick an fha loan youre definitely getting a riskier borrower that simply wouldnt qualify for mortgage insurance in the private sector

7804599 en la ltima d cada el estudio del desarrollo del cerebro ha dado evidencias incuestionables sobre la importancia de los afectos y la formaci n del v nculo del reci n nacido

7804620 this guy putin thinks that statements dont mean anything and that the west will always blink first but they the russian elite have all their money in the west they get very depressed if they are mistreated in the french ski resort of courchevel
7804621 cameron was very good he really got the value side of it very well
7804622 they want to get rid of this government and undermine georgian independence their aim is to get a normal government subordinate to them it would send a very powerful message
7804623 they the russians have fought a war by proxy with nato its about great russia coming back and confronting the horrible west that humiliated russia

7804637 the iron law of institutions is the people who control institutions care first and foremost about their power within the institution rather than the power of the institution itself
7804638 these companies have gotten used to making money by cutting corners

7804652 bahawa di dalam syurga terdapat bilik bilik dilihat dari luar nampak di dalamnya dan dilihat dari dalam kelihatan di luarnya berkata sahabat untuk siapakah ya rasulullah lantas baginda menjawab ialah bagi orang yang baik percakapannya bagi orang yang memberi makan makanan bagi orang yang sentiasa berpuasa bagi orang yang sembahyang di tengah malam sedang manusia banyak tidur
7804653 puasa itu perisai dan sedeqah itu memadam kesalahan dosa sepertimana air memadamkan api
7804654 siapa memberi makan berbuka puasa kepada orang puasa makan baginya seumpama balasan pahala orang yang berpuasa dengan tidak kurang sedikitpun

7804660 i like having the bocce ball because theres great sand and also a football
7804661 its not against the law for people to take photos
7804662 we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7804663 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities it has been very much ebb and flow
7804664 from an outsiders perspective looking in you have to be concerned about all the video cameras in the place
7804665 but i dont think he was too concerned about it
7804666 divulging that information would provide too much information to criminals
7804667 your generation has done more travel and service work than ours did your generation sees yourselves as citizens of the world

7804673 a bunch of us decided to get together and play again
7804674 we kind of dedicated the game to the players that have passed on
7804675 we were at a party and said lets get together lets play
7804676 for me you have to take into consideration how long a driver has been in formula 1 when you evaluate his performance
7804677 for no other reason that puts lewis top of the heap he is the best in formula 1 at the moment
7804678 if you take into account how little experience he has had thats the bit that gives him the edge
7804679 it doesnt mean to say he is particularly quicker than the others or he has dominated its just you have to take how long they have been involved in the sport as one of the values
7804680 how can you criticise him only a fool doesnt realise that irrespective of age you learn something every day
7804681 it is no different for a racing driver because they spend their whole life driving a racing car and they are going to learn more and more
7804682 with all drivers in formula 1 they are on a very steep learning curve and the longer they are in it the steeper it becomes
7804683 im here until something else happens if not im happy here
7804684 ive two and a half years left i signed a three year deal last december if something came up that suited everyone then it would suit me to go but until then i have nothing to say on it
7804685 we need to keep him until the end of the season
7804686 the game is not about west ham and paul ince its about us getting a result
7804687 i looked at the fixtures when they came out and noticed straight away that west ham away was the third game in
7804688 im a bloke who hasnt played it coached it youve got to get the best deputies you possibly can
7804689 if the irish think its going to be a soft option we take and back off from being a physical side then theyre wrong
7804690 there are rules which state you can do things and we will try and stay on that line within the rules
7804691 it was just a bad day and we are thinking about qualifying at anfield
7804692 for liverpool the champions league is a huge competition and it would be a disaster not to get through
7804693 nobody in the squad is thinking about anything other than qualifying
7804694 i am always optimistic and i am convinced we will beat standard
7804695 but there are no easy games in europe and we are aware that this match is not decided
7804696 the arrest is part of an ongoing investigation by lancashire constabulary and greater manchester counter terrorism unit
7804697 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
7804698 we will endeavour to carry out any searches as quickly as possible to minimise impact on the area concerned
7804699 however inquiries of this nature are complex and may take time to resolve

7804720 being that richmond is still a protected territory of the international league that precludes myself or anybody else from even discussing the matter
7804721 the first thing that has to happen is a willingness to commit to a new stadium before anybody does anything
7804722 i dont think any affiliated league or team will consider richmond without a new stadium
7804723 even if the bowie relocation happens i think its a good possibility of local involvement in ownership
7804724 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7804725 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7804726 the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7804727 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7804728 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7804729 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7804730 he has some domestic problems which he feels he cant clear up playing in plymouth
7804731 i am disappointed but the quicker it is sorted out the better

7804742 we said wow this man is going to be a favorite of the foley family forever
7804743 its not politics a lot of time we talk about our families our mothers because he gives his mother pills on sunday night and so do i stuff like that
7804744 we visit when were in the d c area and he visits when hes up here goes to church with my mother hes just a great person
7804745 obviously i would have liked it the other way around but im thrilled hes going to be a great vice president
7804746 and im going to do everything i can in the area to make sure theyre elected
7804747 we came back for family reasons and i took the job in portsmouth those family reasons have dissipated so i applied for this job received an offer and accepted it
7804748 hes going to be difficult to replace he took the housing authority and turned it right around and reversed a deficit that accumulated under a prior director and made it much more equitable

7804752 cred ca tentativa madonnei de a l compara pe john mccain cu hitler a depasit orice limita si este o insulta adusa tuturor americanilor fie democrati sau republicani
7804753 aceasta demonstreaza foarte clar ca atunci cand este vorba sa l sustina pe barack obama prietenii sai celebritati mondiale nu ezita sa recurga la denigrari si atacuri inacceptabile
7804754 they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7804755 now that the u s breached the agreed points the north is compelled to take
7804756 we urge north korea to resume disablement measures at an early date
7804757 i think this represents the biggest crisis to the denuclearization process since the feb 13 agreement
7804758 the norths kim jong il may have decided that he wont negotiate with the bush administration any more
7804759 an affirmation of the biggest difference between the two parties
7804760 if obama wins and we have a democratic majority in the house and the senate we will see legislation that will remove some of the inequalities we face
7804761 that is one of the biggest differences between the parties
7804762 mccain is committed to perpetuating all of the legal inequalities
7804763 the 10 i think essentially reflects people who are gay mostly very few lesbians i think this is one where you are mostly talking about men whose own lives are such that they personally dont experience much gay discrimination
7804764 and many of them also tend to be upper income
7804765 obviously not all gay people are rich but as with any group we have an element who are wealthy and i think they are voting their pocketbook to a great extent because they are not themselves facing discrimination
7804766 in cases where there are partners they both have healthcare some of the material aspects of discrimination many of these people are immune from them
7804767 the question now is whether enough lobbying has been done to include people who are transgender
7804768 we need more lobbying on that we had a very good hearing on that issue and it helped previously we were running into problems getting it out of committee and i think the hearing we had a major impact on that it also depends on if we get more democrats
7804769 if we can pick up 15 democratic seats then i think we are in a good position to pass a transgender inclusive enda
7804770 is important but i think that the first thing that the new president will have to do is set us on the course to get out of iraq there are only so many things we want to test the military with

7804818 the statutory scheme that new hampshire has for its fire departments is pretty broad
7804819 the attorney generals office is aware of the publicity of certain elements of this and is waiting for some sort of reply to it
7804820 its important to understand though that we all want to do things right
7804821 the association needs to make a distinction between the municipal entity which we approve and the private entity
7804822 there is no entity registered with the state of new hampshire known as the stratham volunteer fire department association or any other variation thereof
7804823 the association can continue to function the way that it has been as long as they file for nonprofit status
7804824 it seems to me that the thing for us to do is to talk to the firemans association by way of president stan walker
7804825 ive been speaking to people with both the fire department and the fire association and i know they are both on board with this

7804840 as long as you learn from every match then its a good match in my mind
7804841 i felt much less nervous out on the court than last year and was able to feed off the crowd instead of being overwhelmed by it
7804842 if you ask anybody in las vegas about andre agassi they only have positive things to say about him
7804843 he founded a school thats completely paid for and helps keeps the younger kids out of trouble and im so thankful that he did it without him i wouldnt be anywhere
7804844 it was pretty overwhelming at first but im comfortable with the both of them now
7804845 i hit with steffi three weeks ago at home and andre also comes out on occasion he also helped me with strategy before playing some clay court tournaments this year
7804846 they take it far more seriously than junior players do
7804847 this is their job so this is how theyre going to make
7804848 in europe they dont really have national events and theres not the differentiation between college and pro tennis
7804849 you go to college if you havent made it as a pro player
7804850 the birthday child is surrounded by kids ripping at his her presents
7804851 he is just kind of like ok see ya later and he leaves
7804852 we generally say that 4 is old enough for the parent to bring a kid to a party and then come back when the party is over
7804853 parents start to leave their kids at parties around 6 or 7
7804854 and by 8 or 9 the kids dont want you there anymore
7804855 sometimes my wife will say all the other husbands were at the last party
7804856 though it may be different if its a cousin or beloved next door neighbor
7804857 it was probably the worst one day international we have played in two years england certainly played well but we were more disappointed in our performance weve got to improve in all departments england probably scored 25 runs too many and from a batting point of view we lost wickets at key moments
7804858 and certainly we werent up to standard in the field there is a lot of work to be done in all three departments weve had a couple of days now to get out practice and chat about it hopefully we can come out and turn the tables
7804859 siento una inmensa alegr a porque he vuelto a nacer y una inmensa tristeza por todo lo que ha pasado me hubiera gustado que igual que sal yo salieran los dem s

7804862 we are deeply concerned about the potential adverse impact on regional and local newspapers an impact not outweighed in our opinion by any value for money to licence fee payers or society as a whole
7804863 we are deeply concerned about the potential adverse impact on regional and local newspapers an impact not outweighed in our opinion by any value for money to licence fee payers or society as a whole
7804864 we have got a good result against villa you could tell the fans enjoyed themselves but now we must look forward to the next game
7804865 obviously when you get result in the premier league it gees everyone up were off and running now the confidence and the belief are there and i dont think we should be afraid of anyone
7804866 george mccartney may feature but other than that were a bit light on the ground with regard to one or two of the others coming back
7804867 they havent gone away yet so weve got to work as hard as we possibly can to get these players back
7804868 i thought he played pretty well for about a set and a half it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7804869 im feeling really confident just now regardless of what happened in beijing

7804873 these are full step increases and that is a pretty good sign in bond rating industry
7804874 what with the roadworks traffic congestion and huge numbers of tourists around at this time of year we felt that the city was missing something a bit of peace and quiet and so we decided to disperse the crowds for an evening it also cleaned the air because everyone stopped smoking
7804875 farce whats next teams of ninjas at every shop doorway to combat evil invading customers nails in the road to stop cars getting access to the streets we demand an end to these improvements right now
7804876 increasing fuel prices highway congestion airline issues and environmental awareness continue to make intercity passenger rail extremely relevant and popular
7804877 in addition we continue to work on service improvements and better on time performance which draws more ridership and revenue each month
7804878 our record setting ridership and ticket revenue in the month of july alone indicate we will end the year with approximately three million new passenger trips in fy09
7804879 we wanted the girls to think of people in the community who would appreciate receiving a message of hope
7804880 after discussing this with the girls we realized each girl was somehow affected one way or another with cancer whether it was a friend or family member
7804881 baseball is one of my favorite sports so it is good to watch professional players
7804882 i liked watching the game and seeing the professional players
7804883 its a good charitable event and you get to meet new people
7804884 i enjoy seeing our town police officers play professional stars
7804885 we dont worry about the score we just do it to have fun and raise money
7804886 we just want you guys to have a good time today
7804887 they want to do something for the community they want to do something for their fellow man
7804888 we used to have to buy our own boots coat and hat

7804902 he is an amazing human being and it is truly an honour for me to be recognized in such a wonderful way by such a gifted musician and exceptional person
7804903 because of 17 years of war and chaos in somalia recurrent natural disasters the constant displacement of families and the lack of traditional or modern education young people like me have not heard about biri ma geydo
7804904 nowadays women children and civilians are indiscriminate victims of clashes that occur in mogadishu or elsewhere
7804905 international humanitarian law contains provisions from customary military and general laws it was created to be applied in wartime and therefore its parallel with biri ma geydo is easy to explain to somalis
7804906 somalia is a country that has been ravaged by civil strife for nearly 17 years in mogadishu and other cities where recurrent armed clashes occur the population is often trapped in the midst of fighting and residential areas are hit
7804907 medina and keysaney the two main hospitals in mogadishu supported by the icrc treat dozens of people hit by bullet or shrapnel every week a third of these admissions are women and children
7804908 im sure the biri ma geydo radio programmes will have a positive impact on many young people engaged in armed conflict and who do not respect the basic rules of the fighting during clashes
7804909 our biri ma geydo is probably older than your international humanitarian law everybody should know about it somalis should be proud of it and should have great respect for it

7805021 one who is deprived of his or her full humanity being taken care of in a very patronizing way
7805022 the customary image of the victim is that of an innocent ignorant child or woman paying the price for political ideological power struggles is there anything more non ideological than this pain of the other in its naked mute palpable presence this perplexed gaze of a starved or wounded child who just stares into the camera lost and unaware of what is going on around them is today the sublime image that cancels out all other images
7805023 the ideal subject victim is a political subject without a clear agenda a subject of helpless suffering sympathizing with all suffering sides in the conflict caught up in a madness of a local clash that can be pacified only by the intervention of a benevolent power

7805029 what bothers us in the other is that he appears to enjoy a privileged relationship to the object the other either possesses the object treasure having snatched it away from us which is why we dont have it or poses a threat to our possession of the object

7805046 is it fair to criminalize such social relationships where no third party is harmed when a social relationship is forged which gives a new lease of life to both the stakeholders then law ought not to step in to criminalize and punish such relationships

7805056 ja maar die kan daar niets aan doen die moet dat vinden van haar geloof
7805057 maar dat is toch eigenlijk best een beetje stom dat je iets moet vinden wat je eigenlijk misschien wel helemaal niet vindt
7805058 jawel maar dat mag je niet zeggen dat valt onder vrijheid van religie en dat is natuurlijk heilig
7805059 dus als dat moet van je geloof dan mag je anderen wel stom vinden maar anders niet
7805060 en als dat moet van je geloof dan mag je wel intolerant zijn maar anders niet
7805061 in zulke uiteenlopende staten als turkmenistan zimbabwe en moldavi worden de media onderdrukt of verboden omdat de heersers meningsuiting verbieden die ingaat tegen hun eigen verhaal over hoe de dingen zijn
7805062 waarheid is datgene wat autoriteiten en machthebbers voor het publiek verborgen willen houden
7805063 als de strijd om de waarheid wordt gestreden zonder dat de pers zich verantwoordt onttrekt zij zich aan haar democratische plicht en knaagt zij aan het fundament van de persvrijheid
7805064 vroeger zag je in de media terug wat er in de politiek gebeurde
7805065 een politicus die langer mee wil zal zich drie keer bedenken alvorens zich kritisch over de media uit te laten ruzie met de pers is iets wat maar weinig politici zich kunnen veroorloven
7805066 als je redelijk onverdachte kritiek uit stijgt meteen een gebrul op en valllen termen als persbreidel dat getuigt van een angst die ik verdacht vind een pers die zichzelf serieus neemt kan ook tegen kritiek tegenwoordig wordt alles kritisch belicht dus waarom de media dan niet
7805067 een ieder heeft recht op vrijheid van mening en meningsuiting dit recht omvat de vrijheid om zonder inmenging een mening te koesteren en om door alle middelen en ongeacht grenzen inlichtingen en denkbeelden op te sporen te ontvangen en door te geven
7805068 de persoon mag alleen aangevallen worden en dan met alle egards die men aan elke medemens ook de tegenstander verschuldigd is wanneer het algemeen belang dit werkelijk onverbiddelijk eist
7805069 democratie is de heerschappij van het goed ge nformeerde volk
7805070 informeert de burger en de staatkundige instituties draagt bij aan opinievorming en voedt zo het politieke debat
7805071 wie vrij kan denken en vrij kan spreken is een vrij mens als de mensen van een land vrij zijn dan pas is een land vrij dat is de essentie van de vrijheid van meningsuiting en de kern van onze democratie alleen al het gevoel niet alles te durven zeggen of schrijven is een feitelijke inperking van de vrijheid van meningsuiting want wie bepaalt wanneer iets onnodig kwetsend is de staat dat kan niet de bedoeling zijn is er dan geen enkele beperking aan de vrijheid van meningsuiting jawel die vrijheid wordt achteraf begrensd door de wet bijvoorbeeld als het gaat om oproepen tot geweld maar vooraf is er alleen de persoonlijke verantwoordelijkheid
7805072 absolute openheid is in het internettijdperk een vereiste wat volgens jane singer ook betekent dat een journalist die een reportage maakt in een kankercentrum moet melden wat zijn eigen ervaringen zijn met kanker en wie een belang heeft bij iemand die hij beschrijft moet dat in het artikel melden alleen dan weet de lezer hoe hij het artikel moet beoordelen
7805073 juist in de politieke arena waar gedachten met gedachten worden bestreden en argumenten tegenover argumenten worden geplaatst zijn bedreigende of radicale idee n het minst gevaarlijk
7805074 waarheid is datgene wat autoriteiten en machthebbers voor het publiek verborgen willen houden
7805075 een politicus die langer mee wil zal zich drie keer bedenken alvorens zich kritisch over de media uit te laten ruzie met de pers is iets wat maar weinig politici zich kunnen veroorloven
7805076 als je redelijk onverdachte kritiek uit stijgt meteen een gebrul op en valllen termen als persbreidel dat getuigt van een angst die ik verdacht vind
7805077 de journalist kan zich niet langer doof houden voor een samenleving die steeds kritischer wordt over het functioneren van de media verantwoording afleggen is een noodzaak geworden tot nu toe hebben de media daarbij als platform gediend nu zijn zij zelf aan de beurt
7805078 voorlopig lijkt mij de mogelijkheid om de journalistiek te controleren toereikend
7805079 de redacties van nederlandse kwaliteitskranten behoren tot de best bevolkte ter wereld de journalisten tot de best betaalde van europa ze zijn ok de conservatiefste bolwerken ter wereld waar journalistieke onafhankelijkheid veelal wordt ge nterpreteerd als ik doe wat ik wil waar wordt geschermd met allerhande statuten en stichtingen en waar de lezer veelal de laatste zorg van de redacteuren is
7805080 vroeger zag je in de media terug wat er in de politiek gebeurde tegenwoordig is dat vaak andersom dat brengt een grote verantwoordelijkheid met zich mee
7805081 zijn de media in staat om de waarheid te vertellen aan die vraag gaat een andere voraf waarom zouden ze de macht van de media is altijd tweekoppig het gaat om de macht van de vrije mening van feiten van een bron van idee n om een macht die fundamenteel is voor de uitvoering van democratie aan de andere kant is het een macht op zich de macht om te overtuigen te straffen en te belonen te vervormen te liegen te bedriegen de media zeggen dat hun grootste nut voor de burger is dat zij de gevestigde macht ter verantwoording kunnen roepen de media met al hun aanzienlijke macht moeten zelf ook ter verantwoording kunnen worden geroepen als dat niet gebeurt zullen zij net als bij andere machten het geval is corrumperen om te beginnen zichzelf
7805082 de media roepen de macht ter verantwoording maar zijn zelf ook een deel van de macht geworden
7805083 vrije media zijn essentieel voor de democratie maar het uitoefenen van die vrijheid kan de democratie ook beschadigen
7805084 onduidelijk wordt wanneer er gebeurtenissen worden weergegeven en wanneer sprake is van
7805085 hans adriaansens voorzitter van de rmo zegt dat het hem en de zijnen vooral gaat om de verantwoordingsstructuur van de vrije pers
7805086 ook hoofdredacteuren van overwegend progressieve kranten gingen zich een houding aanmeten die ze ernstig hadden bekritiseerd als het was gegaan over ik noem maar medisch specialisten
7805087 democratie is de heerschappij van het goed ge nformeerde volk
7805088 ook de pers kan worden beschouwd als een institutie met het vrije woord als centrale waarde net als de staatkundige instituties staat de pers in dienst van de democratie hij informeert de burger en de staatkundige instituties draagt bij aan opinievorming en voedt zo het politieke debat
7805089 de persoon mag alleen aangevallen worden en dan met alle egards die men aan elke medemens ook de tegenstander verschuldigd is wanneer het algemeen belang dit werkelijk onverbiddelijk eist
7805090 democratie is meer dan alleen maar naar de stembus gaan en je afgevaardigden kiezen deze formele formule dient ingebed te zijn in een levende praktijk van openbare beraadslaging waarin waarden idee n en standpunten in publieke discussies worden uitgewisseld en waarin de kans bestaat dat waarden en standpunten van elkaar worden overgenomen government by discussion noemt amartya sen dit besluitvorming na ernstige en serieuze discussie deze inhoudelijke kern van de democratie is de basis voor pluralisme en tolerantie in een samenleving vrije uitwisselingen van idee n openbare beraadslagingen en de bereidheid om van elkaar te leren zijn waar ook ter wereld belangrijker dan raciale vooroordelen of etnische vooringenomenheid democratie is een betere samenlevingsvorm omdat het verkeerde besluiten van machthebbers op tijd kan corrigeren daarvoor is een vrije pers en een brede verspreiding van zo veel mogelijk dissidente geluiden een absolute voorwaarde in combinatie met een zo ernstig mogelijke publieke beraadslaging waar alle standpunten gehoord en gewogen worden
7805091 teksten mogen best onsmakelijk onfatsoenlijk en schokkend zijn vindt egbert dommering hoogleraar informatierecht aan de universiteit van amsterdam
7805092 veel van deze zogemaande columns vormen daarom een combinatie van twee kwaden slechte journalistiek beschuldigingen op basis van niet geverifieerde feiten en slechte satire er valt niet om te lachen egbert dommering oudkerk en de media in tien vragen en antwoorden de volkskrantm 05 02 2004 media doen niet anders dan het morele gehalte van de samenleving reflecteren en in een democratie is dat zelfs hun taak toch nemen zij steeds minder de hiervoor geformuleerde regels in achte in die zin zijn zij de weg kwijt
7805093 zijn collega voegt eraan toe dat het redigeren zoals dat in de spelregels wordt vermeld alleen inhoudt dat ze zinnen minder cryptisch maken en verder bijvoorbeeld onsmakelijke suggestieve of racistische passages schrappen
7805094 het politieke discours met politieke correctheid schoonvegen door onwelgevallige gedachten van het openbare debat te weren is dan ook het paard achter de wagen spannen
7805095 in het anderen de maat nemen zijn de nederlandse media op hun best wie echter denkt dat de nederlandse journalistiek zelf hecht aan heldere gedragscodes komt bedrogen uit het nederlandse bedrijfsleven heeft de code tabaksblat maar de journalistiek heeft code angst de wetenschappelijke raad voor het regeringsbeleid pleitte andermaal voor een aanspreekbare journalistiek door versterking van de zelfregulering en het zoeken van de confrontatie met elkaar en met lezers luisteraars en kijkers in zijn jaarrede tot collega hoofdredacteuren stelde pieter broertjes dat een dergelijk pleidooi sinds jaar en dag wordt gesteund door het genootschap van hoofdredacteuren forum 16 april
7805096 juist omdat politici en andere machthebbers altijd zullen proberen het eigen beeld en de publieke beeldvorming naar eigen wensen in te kleuren en naar willekeur aan te passen zijn onafhankelijke journalisten nodig die op zoek blijven naar de waarheid
7805097 jaar geleden was de wereld in de ban van de iraakse massavernietigingswapens inmiddels weten we dat die dreiging niet op feiten was gebaseerd zijn journalisten ook van deze krant te lichtgelovig geweest de serieuze media in amerika en groot brittanni houden zich al maanden bezig met de vraag hoe de verhalen over die iraakse massavernietigingswapens zo opgeklopt konden worden dat ze geloofwaardig leken faalden de inlichtingendiensten hebben politici selectief gebruik gemaakt van inlichtingen hebben ze de pers bewust misleid

7805130 post code prescribing is rife in the uk with some patients getting access to life extending treatments ahead of a nice decision whilst others are left to die myeloma uk wants to engage with the department of health to find a solution to this growing issue
7805131 these survey findings reveal the dismal state of uk cancer management
7805132 despite significant advances in the treatment of myeloma such as revlimid the majority of patients cannot get access to new life extending drugs until they have been appraised and approved by nice a process that can take up to three years from when the drug is first licensed in the uk
7805133 patients with active myeloma require effective treatment to improve their chances of survival the impact of waiting even a month for treatment can result in a life or death situation
7805134 the provision of funding for treatments currently undergoing nice appraisal is a matter for local pcts and nice has no role in those local decisions
7805135 the department of health has issued guidance to the nhs that makes it clear that funding for a treatment should not be withheld simply because nice guidance does not exist
7805136 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by the time of christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet

7805141 so what xers want are jobs that offer a variety of career paths and allow them to gain fresh marketable skills build a strong network of contacts and put money in the bank

7805146 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest

7805152 he has the right combination of self confidence and humility that is absolutely key for a president
7805153 if it was to happen i think youd just have to take it in your stride
7805154 i think ive taken a lot of confidence out of saturday and not knowing i was going to be there because of mcmenimans illness and yet the team had such a good result

7805160 we think reading is sitting down and reading a novel but there are all sorts of reading
7805161 kids can get as engrossed in a football magazine as they can in a history book or novel we shouldnt be dismissive of other forms of literature i used to read tons of comic books when i was a kid
7805162 were always looking for new ways to get people interested especially the sort of person who wouldnt be hanging around in a childrens bookshop or reading a worthy magazine in a school library this is a way of getting other kids interested who might not know about the books
7805163 its just finding the time to get it right its very difficult to find a kid with the charisma to pull off the character of bond at that age
7805164 to forget how to dig the earth and to tend the soil is to forget ourselves

7805180 with this law now operational it is expected that importers will benefit from the removal of duties and other taxes and subsequently pass on such benefits to the end consumers
7805181 importers are reminded that it should be criminal for anybody to re export these duty free items
7805182 all things being equal prices of those items which are now tax free should have gone down but the information we are getting indicates that after some few days the prices began to move up again the unfortunate thing is that whiles the government continues to lose revenue because of those exemptions some individuals are gaining

7805188 we speak to our doctors on a daily basis about how hes going and where hes at but until you sort of speak to the specialists about what that actually means its a pretty cloudy picture still at the moment
7805189 the polak scenario confuses the issue about where we are with key forwards and we need cleve to be able to get some sort of run without stopping with injury every third or fourth week so theres some question mark on our key forwards

7805252 those who have not played so far will get their chance we play swansea and i will guarantee those who didnt play on saturday will play
7805253 every game we play in this competition we want to win
7805254 we did it at crewe last year and at wigan where we changed the side around
7805255 therell be no real surprises its an experienced team with maybe a few youngsters involved
7805256 the reserves did very very well last season and so some of them might get a chance thats the key to a football club
7805257 it will give the manager something to consider as to who should be in the squad for saturday
7805258 weve got to be looking towards that but if whoever plays tonight doesnt do the business then theyll come off the field the manager wont have it
7805259 but if a team from the premier league want you you should not doubt yourself
7805260 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7805261 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7805262 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
7805263 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together
7805264 direkt gefragt ob die m nner nach denver gekommen seien um obama zu erschie en er bejahte das
7805265 es w re vorschnell zu sagen dass es sich um eine echte bedrohung handelte oder ob diese leute die f higkeiten haben so etwas auszuf hren
7805266 wir sind absolut berzeugt dass es keine glaubhafte gefahr f r den kandidaten den nationalkonvent der demokraten oder die bev lkerung von colorado gibt
7805267 die arbeit beginnt von neuem die hoffnung w chst wieder und der traum lebt weiter
7805268 wir sind um fast vier prozentpunkte vor unserer privaten konkurrenz von sat 1

7805270 nur dann erfolgreich sein wenn in einer gemeinsamen positionierung gegen ber dem georgien konflikt klare signale an russland gehen beispielsweise dass russland georgien nicht besetzen darf
7805271 wir haben im vorigen dezember die entscheidung f r zrenjanin gef llt im april die produktion angefahren heute haben wir 800 arbeiter an drei linien und das ist noch nicht einmal die h lfte dessen was hier in k rze vorhaben
7805272 der standort ist sehr positiv hier sp rt man dass die menschen mit ihrem werk wachsen wollen
7805273 estes dados parecem nos positivos para a jer nimo martins uma vez que n o s as taxas de crescimento permanecem em n veis elevados como tamb m ultrapassaram aquilo que o consensus apontava
7805274 it was a real shame to miss the penalty like that because it had all seemed like the 2006 world cup against australia
7805275 i came on as a substitute and had a penalty that could decide the game it all seemed written for me like a film
7805276 i had a thousand thoughts in my head and i wondered whether to change the usual angle that i hit penalties at
7805277 i was asking myself whether to hit in with the inside of my foot and not to strike it too fully but it went too high anyway
7805278 it was such a pity because i had prepared a hundred dedications and celebrations
7805279 our objective is to beat fc barcelona because up until now no polish side has ever done that we are at home and we want to show that we are strong and to give our best in order to say that we tried
7805280 our display this time will be much much better of that i am confident
7805281 our performance in liege was poor but the result was good we did not concede an away goal and we hope that playing the second leg at anfield will make a massive difference
7805282 you can see the squad is now starting to look stronger with the return of ryan javier and lucas the manager has a lot more options now
7805283 there is still some time in the transfer window and i think in that time you will start to see our squad get to full strength
7805284 i think there will be another arrival before the deadline
7805285 the managers obviously got his eye on two or three different players and i think it would help us if another new face came in
7805286 sometimes you need the kick up the backside similar to the one we had against liege in the away leg you dont want to go into the season a little bit complacent and no one could argue against the fact liege were the better team on the night
7805287 it was certainly a wake up call for us and the best thing about it was that we didnt get beat
7805288 were still in the tie and know that at anfield we will play a lot better liege will also find it more difficult
7805289 last season we only lost once at home but had too many draws which isnt good enough
7805290 i think its great being less famous i blame the fact i had shall we say a meeting with russell crowe
7805291 i had never seen or heard such bad press about me and its been great in a funny kind of way it was a good thing because i now realise the world does not revolve around me
7805292 probleem ligt bij belgacom en daar kunnen wij niets aan doen ge zult er moeten mee leren leven

7805294 our findings have important implications for both education and social policy
7805295 first they suggest that policies that change a childs exposure to classmates from troubled families will have important consequences for his or her education outcomes in addition the results also help provide a more complete measure of the social costs of family conflict
7805296 apenas unos pocos que s lo saben de pegar carteles y hacer fotocopias
7805297 employers need to take some responsibility for the impact that overwork can have on their employees health with our research showing that a significant amount of it workers find it difficult to maintain relationships or suffer ill health the uks culture of working long hours needs to be addressed as businesses look to derive as much value from their people assets as possible during lean times it is going to be imperative that we dont drive employees to burnout
7805298 despite the predicted downturn we are still suffering a skills crisis so it is essential that we dont disillusion our skilled workers at a time when we need them most

7805306 the first yellow card is acceptable but you should never get a second yellow card like that and mark has got to learn that
7805307 it is for his own good and for the good of the team that he learns
7805308 the important thing is that he realises that he has made an error but i think he knows himself that he has left the rest of the team in the lurch
7805309 there is a saying in holland that the bigger trees catch more wind
7805310 maybe i have an image problem when other players do that then the game is allowed to play on
7805311 it is possible that i am being watched particularly closely
7805312 i have seen the scene several times in tv even in the super slow motion and i have to say that unfortunately both yellow cards are correct
7805313 van bommel is a short tempered character who does not have control over himself and therefore does not do himself nor the team any favours

7805340 i try not to make too much noise and wake him up im just usually walking around the room or ill walk outside the room and walk around when i cant sleep ive got too much going through my head its hard for me to sleep now so i know the night before the game is going to be ridiculous
7805341 its going to be a disappointment if we dont do what we think we can do senior defensive end jake ratliff said during the teams weekly monday news conference
7805342 its what we work for all year itll be a big disappointment if we let ourselves down
7805343 coach leach talks about that game a lot mcbath said
7805344 i definitely dont want to make sports center for that we cant let that happen
7805345 theyre the most athletic defense weve had since ive been here for sure said harrell a fifth year senior
7805346 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
7805347 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
7805348 coupling the two you have slow growth with higher inflation
7805349 weve agreed to the next step which will hopefully provide a solution we are committed to pursuing all of our options with fred timms
7805350 i did have too much stuff in there i know but i was dealing with it
7805351 i was packing it up getting it organized to move and that was when the fire marshal came there are other apartments that are worse than mine but those residents are still in their apartments
7805352 all they have to do is shuffle a few papers and i would be in an apartment somewhere regina towers ramsey somewhere
7805353 we need a policy to create jobs here in america
7805354 to invest in people and our infrastructure right here in the usa
7805355 at a time when iraq has a 79 billion surplus they have parked it in banks in new york city it doesnt make too much sense for us to be still spending u s taxpayer dollars 10 billion monthly rebuilding baghdad
7805356 we should use some of that money to rebuild virginia building roads and laying broadband lines and putting people back to work
7805357 we create jobs now but we also create the competitive platform for the future
7805358 i refuse to sit back like we did in 2000 and 2004 this administration is the worst administration in american foreign policy in modern history maybe ever every single thing theyve touched has been a near disaster
7805359 he has retired now and he has just written that to sell the book
7805360 ive never heard of that working how much difference could a breath mint make
7805361 if hes come out and said that hes used it yes its unethical
7805362 yes he got away with it good luck to him you cant change the result of the test series so its no good worrying about it
7805363 for me it doesnt totally tarnish it because what i did like about the england bowlers in that series was their wrist release and for the first 10 overs jones and flintoff got the new ball to swing beautifully but from the 20 to 45 over mark that is where the mints are helping
7805364 and they bowled better reverse swing than us they definitely got an illegal advantage over us in those overs
7805365 at least now we know why england lost the next ashes they lost their minty guy
7805366 if it was proved they cheated we would have a right to be upset

7805388 to bel air someone is to tell them a shaggy dog story supposedly relating to a serious matter and
7805389 goes on smoothly and gives me long and full looking results it also wears well without smears smudges or flakes in fact i prefer it over my usual big name drugstore brands
7805390 no clumps at all from this one but what i cant believe is that it actually curled my stick straight lashes i just wish i didnt need eye makeup remover to get it off and surprisingly the nonslip rubber handle on the wand is a plus
7805391 clumps as it goes on but gives pretty good volume and wears well through the whole day
7805392 although i think i get more volume from artistry definitive lash mascara cargo supereyes glides on so smoothly that my lashes look naturally lush also despite having oily lids ive experienced no smudging melting or flaking of any sort even after a sweaty workout miraculous
7805393 i usually use a lash thickening formula with a dense brush such as lor al paris voluminous or lash out m a c zoom lash made my lashes noticeably longer but its thinner consistency and less dense brush dont deliver much volume i compensated with more wand strokes and smoothed out a bit of clumping with a lash comb
7805394 i need lots of mascara just to look like i have lashes so clumping can be a slight issue with this mascara however the tapered perfectly staggered flexible lash exact bristles glide through my lashes and the smooth formula delivers a natural yet defined fringe that doesnt smudge or smear despite my oil slick lids
7805395 this brush takes getting used to but its cool shaped like a triangle with three minicombs separated by channels of mascara it allows me better control over the amount of mascara i apply i can make a rolling action with my wrist to put lots on or i can hold it relatively straight to put on a little
7805396 this easily mastered two stepper begins with a primer which has a great densely bristled brush step twos brush is a comb which i didnt think id like at first but it actually separates the lashes nicely and applies the product well my lashes look very long
7805397 the 3d comb wand is somewhat difficult to use the mascara sits in channels between a trio of minicombs like the giorgio armani brush and can go on quite thickly but the wand design allowed me to use the tiny comb teeth to separate clumpy areas the final result is nicely dramatic and id use telescopic for evenings out but only when i have time to use the brush properly
7805398 this mascara features a bent wand applicator which seemed strange at first but eventually had me wondering why all mascara wands arent bent its ergonomics allow for easy application even to the lashes at the corner of the eyes the formula itself wears well and washes off easily at the end of the day
7805399 this one promised fuller longer and curvier lashes and although the end result is fuller and a bit longer i still need to use a lash curler as well the brush is too dense to comb through my lashes to clear the slight clumping that occurred during application
7805400 the brush has too many jagged bristles for me to apply the mascara evenly once i figured out how to make the brush work for me though it made my lashes look longer yet lightweight however i noticed it flaking off at the end of the day
7805401 a more watery formula than my usual brand it made my lashes look longer and more defined without adding volume and without clumping
7805402 i have very sensitive eyes and several allergies so a no flake hypoallergenic formula is key wonder volume is opthalmologist and allergy tested and doesnt flake into my eyes it also goes on easily despite the number of wand strokes i need to get the definition i want
7805403 i have allergies so i like mascara that goes on smoothly and dries quickly before my eyes can water this one is exactly what i want a thin drier consistency that doesnt smudge my lashes look natural yet longer and more defined the brush however could be a little less dense to separate my lashes better
7805404 this is a gentle formula that wears well if applied sparingly at the outset and washes off easily i prefer a curved brush but this one was good at separating my lashes nice for everyday id use something else to glam up
7805405 more on mascara 17 brands hit the fringes and whats your opinion
7805406 maybelline great lash mascara well i choose define a lash instead
7805407 f is for flat rate canada post e bay boxes
7805408 instead try eating oranges pineapple and kiwi each of which is rich in the antioxidants that dieticians recommend but are less likely to stain your teeth

7805437 breast cancer psychological distress and life events among young women
7805438 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7805439 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7805440 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7805441 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
7805442 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed

7805460 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7805461 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7805462 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7805463 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7805464 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7805465 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7805466 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7805467 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7805468 you cant walk down the road to the car yourself and i am not coming with you because i am talking stop bothering me
7805469 i trust you lets give it a try do you remember where the car is can you make it there okay i will wait for you by the corner and come to find you if you need help but i think you will be able to get there and back without a problem
7805470 are you sure you have made the right decision about this
7805471 how are they going to learn anything if i dont get them out there and expose them to all the knowledge that is available to them
7805472 for me michael phelps is a huge inspiration and someone i really look up to
7805473 we are still apart we are enjoying being good friends we have spent two years together you dont lose that
7805474 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7805475 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7805476 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7805477 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7805478 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7805479 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7805480 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7805481 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7805482 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7805483 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7805484 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7805485 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7805486 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7805487 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7805488 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7805489 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7805490 no one works for someone we all just work together
7805491 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7805492 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7805493 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7805494 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7805495 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7805496 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7805497 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7805498 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7805499 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7805500 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7805501 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7805502 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7805503 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7805504 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7805505 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7805506 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7805507 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7805508 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7805509 kesulitan yang dihadapi yaitu perpanjangan kontrak yang menyulitkan karena pada waktu impor dulu kontraktor 6 bulan sekarang hanya 2 3 bulan tergantung perusahaannya
7805510 apakah akan impor dengan jangka waktu 2 3 bulan atau terpaksa beli di dalam negeri tapi kalau beli dalam negeri masalah lain yang dihadapi harus adanya proses tambahan dalam produksi karena dalam negeri hanya menyediakan tebu untuk gula kristal kan bukan seperti gula rafinasi yang selama ini diimpor
7805511 waktu itu kami masih sempat menolak karena disinyalir akan menimbulkan ketidakpastian untuk yang saat ini pemerintah langsung menerapkan tanpa ada pemberitahuan terlebih dahulu
7805512 seperti yang paling urgent di jakarta kita kan mau membuat mrt itu kolaborasi antara pemerintah pusat dan pemda kalau terlalu besar pusat akan memberikan partisipasi tapi yang melakukan dan me manage itu daerah
7805513 jadi sebenarnya dengan uu pdrd sekarang memungkinkan pemerintah untuk melakukan intervensi atau menaikkan tarif
7805514 harapan di ulang tahun mudah mudahan pengangguran menurun di bawah 5 mudah mudahan penerintahan di tahun depan juga jauh lebih bagus
7805515 supply lebih kecil dari pada demand permintaan indent 3 sampai 4 bulan
7805516 permintaan bus juga cukup tinggi didunia sehingga 2009 kita optimis akan produksi lebih memang kita ada kuota dari prinsipal mereka melihat juga dari sisi profitnya
7805517 saya mendukung untuk produksi bus di indonesia sekarang ini masih diskusi dengan para insinyur
7805518 kami minta bappebti segera memberikan kepastian skema penyelesaian masalah ini sesegera mungkin
7805519 bahkan tidak satu pun orang bappebti yang menemui kami dari kemarin padahal menurut peraturan perdagangan berjangka bappebti wajib mengadakan mediasi dengan nasabah jika terjadi masalah namun menemui kami saja tidak apalagi mediasi
7805520 namun ketika tanggal 19 kemarin kami kesini bappebti menyatakan belum menerima hasil pemetaan dari bbj sepertinya antara bappebti dan bbj saling melempar bola
7805521 kenyataannya pada 19 agustus bappebti menyatakan tidak pernah memberikan janji oleh karena itu kemarin kami datang kembali untuk berdemonstrasi meminta kejelasan namun sejak kemarin belum ada satu pun orang bappebti yang keluar menemui kami
7805522 we kunnen het zelf niet geloven maar de lamp schijnt nog altijd even sterk als in het begin
7805523 mijn man jim stierf tien jaar geleden en nu doet de lamp mij aan hem denken als de lamp brandt voelt het alsof mijn man me in de gaten houdt en beschermt
7805524 ik moet de hele tijd mijn andere lampen vervangen maar deze nooit zo was dat vroeger toen werden dingen gemaakt die lang mee konden gaan
7805525 natuurlijk zal ik er kapot van zijn maar ik weet gewoon dat ze nog jaren zal blijven branden
7805526 maar na telefonisch contact met bondscoach ren vandereycken heb ik besloten om voor belgi te kiezen
7805527 ik heb er lang over nagedacht maar dit is de juiste keuze en twijfel er niet aan het is een definitieve beslissing
7805528 veel vrienden en familie begrijpen mijn keuze niet maar ik geloof dat ik de juiste beslissing genomen heb door voor belgi te kiezen mijn toekomst ligt hier in europa de voorbije maanden was het niet simpel om voor marokko te spelen in januari en juni als de competitie hier stil ligt worden daar belangrijke interlands afgewerkt ik had zelden rust dat is zwaar en houdt risicos in op blessures
7805529 we felt it was a sound business decision to encourage the match as it helped us to illustrate the importance of the relationship foster an attitude of business collaboration and fortify the bond between the two cities this is crucial for our enterprise and others like us in the uk or the us it means that we can do anything together sell uk made cbrn suits throughout america or play against each other in a friendly rugby match
7805530 the inaugural mayors cup challenge match was a resounding success regardless of the final score of the match we had a fabulous experience in our sister city of dundee and a very successful trip on behalf of both alexandrias rugby team and its business community we feel that remploy frontlines support of alexandria rugby and the twinned cities programme will prove to be just as beneficial to our hometown as it is for dundee we look forward to building on what weve started over the years to come
7805531 remploy frontline is very proud to have been a part of this unique twinned city event we hope that our involvement in this programme encourages more businesses and organisations in both cities to look more closely at ways they can support the business and cultural exchanges based on remploy frontlines mission it would be great if alexandria and dundee can create more opportunities for otherwise disabled people and help further enrich their lives
7805532 although the workforce is primarily disabled we have some of the most highly skilled and motivated manufacturing experts in the world
7805533 we wanted to make buddybackup completely free for everyone to use and to remove the limitations that previously were only unlocked in the paid version we didnt think it was fair to do this when so many users had already bought the software so we decided to offer a refund to everyone who has paid and upgrade all current users to the full version of the software
7805534 we are contacting all users through their registration email to let them know they are entitled to a refund any unclaimed money will be donated to a multiple sclerosis charity and save the children because buddybackup is used by people from all over the world we wanted to give to global charities as well as the united kingdom and u s a we have large user bases in china vietnam india and many other eastern and european countries so we thought it right to find charities that would be relevant to all our users
7805535 two major factors were apparent to us when chris and the journeymaker 5 team approached us for support
7805536 first remploy frontline develops and manufactures world class flotation jackets ideally suited for champions like the journeymaker 5 and the waters in which they were racing second chris and his team are helping the uks many disabled children through enriching life experiences one of remploys precepts for helping disabled adults via employment opportunities
7805537 we were confident in our skills as experienced sailors and competitors but we knew we would need some excellent kit on board to help give us a leading edge
7805538 having a life jacket around me from our sister company remploy frontline made me feel safe and secure because i know what level of dedicated workmanship and quality went into producing this dependable deep water life jacket
7805539 we completed the challenge with the second fastest time ever
7805540 we beat the boats team with the previous record and they even brought in two top uk professional ultra endurance runners this year for the footrace part of the challenge
7805541 as time goes on there are always new needs for the trust to keep it going the need for more funding to continue to exist so that more disabled children across britain can have more enriched lives the trust gives kids an opportunity to do things and accomplish physical feats that they normally could not the trust like remploy helps encourage people with disabilities who are too often told what they cannot do instead of shown what they can do
7805542 although the workforce is primarily disabled we have some of the most highly skilled and motivated manufacturing experts in the world
7805543 nu de rechter de strafbare feiten heeft gekwalificeerd is het logisch dat ook een tuchtonderzoek wordt gelast door minister keulen tuchtsancties zoals een schorsing of ontzetting uit het ambt kunnen worden opgelegd op grond van grove nalatigheid of kennelijk wangedrag gesjoemel bij overheidsopdrachten valt onder die laatste categorie

7805551 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7805552 it could turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7805553 das zeigt ganz klar dass wenn es der unterst tzung von barrack obama dient seine prominenten anh nger weltweit auch nicht davor zur ckschrecken schmutzkampagnen zu fahren die jede grenze berschreiten

7805560 we bow down before the testimony of the life and death of edith stein an outstanding daughter of israel and at the same time a daughter of the carmelite order sister teresa benedicta of the cross a personality who united within her rich life a dramatic synthesis of our century it was the synthesis of a history full of deep wounds that are still hurting and also the synthesis of the full truth about man all this came together in a single heart that remained restless and unfulfilled until it finally found rest in god
7805561 more than anything else this helped make the youngest child very precious to her mother
7805562 i consciously decided of my own volition to give up praying
7805563 when i was at school and during my first years at university
7805564 i was a radical suffragette then i lost interest in the whole issue now i am looking for purely pragmatic solutions
7805565 this was my first encounter with the cross and the divine power it imparts to those who bear it it was the moment when my unbelief collapsed and christ began to shine his light on me christ in the mystery of the cross
7805566 things were in gods plan which i had not planned at all i am coming to the living faith and conviction that from gods point of view there is no chance and that the whole of my life down to every detail has been mapped out in gods divine providence and makes complete and perfect sense in gods all seeing eyes
7805567 every time i feel my powerlessness and inability to influence people directly i become more keenly aware of the necessity of my own holocaust
7805568 should academic careers be opened up to ladies then i can recommend her whole heartedly and as my first choice for admission to a professorship
7805569 when i had finished the book i said to myself this is the truth
7805570 i had given up practising my jewish religion when i was a 14 year old girl and did not begin to feel jewish again until i had returned to god
7805571 during the time immediately before and quite some time after my conversion i thought that leading a religious life meant giving up all earthly things and having ones mind fixed on divine things only gradually however i learnt that other things are expected of us in this world i even believe that the deeper someone is drawn to god the more he has to get beyond himself in this sense that is go into the world and carry divine life into it
7805572 pursue scholarship as a service to god it was not until i had understood this that i seriously began to approach academic work again
7805573 if anyone comes to me i want to lead them to him
7805574 i had heard of severe measures against jews before but now it dawned on me that god had laid his hand heavily on his people and that the destiny of these people would also be mine
7805575 if i cant go on here then there are no longer any opportunities for me in germany
7805576 human activities cannot help us but only the suffering of christ it is my desire to share in it
7805577 i dont want to say anything against him he may have been a very good person but why did he make himself god
7805578 i did not feel any passionate joy what i had just experienced was too terrible but i felt a profound peace in the safe haven of gods will
7805579 i understood the cross as the destiny of gods people which was beginning to be apparent at the time 1933 i felt that those who understood the cross of christ should take it upon themselves on everybodys behalf of course i know better now what it means to be wedded to the lord in the sign of the cross however one can never comprehend it because it is a mystery
7805580 my mother held on to her faith to the last moment but as her faith and her firm trust in her god were the last thing that was still alive in the throes of her death i am confident that she will have met a very merciful judge and that she is now my most faithful helper so that i can reach the goal as well
7805581 those who join the carmelite order are not lost to their near and dear ones but have been won for them because it is our vocation to intercede to god for everyone
7805582 i keep thinking of queen esther who was taken away from her people precisely because god wanted her to plead with the king on behalf of her nation i am a very poor and powerless little esther but the king who has chosen me is infinitely great and merciful this is great comfort
7805583 even now i accept the death that god has prepared for me in complete submission and with joy as being his most holy will for me i ask the lord to accept my life and my death so that the lord will be accepted by his people and that his kingdom may come in glory for the salvation of germany and the peace of the world
7805584 i simply want to report what i experienced as part of jewish humanity
7805585 we who grew up in judaism have a duty to bear witness to the young generation who are brought up in racial hatred from early childhood
7805586 the churchs teacher of mysticism and the father of the carmelites john of the cross on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of his birth 1542 1942
7805587 one can only gain a scientia crucis knowledge of the cross if one has thoroughly experienced the cross i have been convinced of this from the first moment onwards and have said with all my heart ave crux spes unica i welcome you cross our only hope
7805588 i never knew that people could be like this neither did i know that my brothers and sisters would have to suffer like this i pray for them every hour will god hear my prayers he will certainly hear them in their distress
7805589 she is a witness to gods presence in a world where god is absent
7805590 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7805591 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7805592 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7805593 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7805594 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7805595 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7805596 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7805597 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7805598 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7805599 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7805600 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7805601 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7805602 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7805603 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7805604 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7805605 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7805606 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7805607 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7805608 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7805609 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7805610 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7805611 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7805612 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7805613 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7805614 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7805615 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7805616 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7805617 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7805618 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually

7805624 our second annual inc 5000 continues the most ambitious project in business journalism
7805625 the inc 5000 gives an unrivalled portrait of young underreported companies across all industries doing fascinating things with cutting edge business models as well as older companies that are still showing impressive growth
7805626 its a great honor to be acknowledged among both well known and emerging young companies this award and recognition is a satisfying payoff for our teams years of hard work and commitment to our customers
7805627 much like in the u s the european venture industry is experiencing great softness in the ipo and m amp a markets and this is putting a damper on deal flow
7805628 in particular health care companies which have seen the pipeline of ipos dry up over the last year posted their worst quarter on record were seeing a similar downward trend for health care companies in the u s where investment has fallen off 31 in the first six months of the year
7805629 there is a silver lining in this quarters figures and its that we are seeing early stage deals make up a greater percentage of deal activity in europe
7805630 venture capitalists are being very selective about the companies they back but theyre by no means abandoning the european market in the first six months of the year 44 of venture deals in europe were seed or first rounds we havent seen this level of early stage interest since the first half of 2001
7805631 we are very pleased to complete our acquisition of pick your part

7805633 we hebben inderdaad even gevreesd dat we zonder medailles zouden moeten terugkeren
7805634 ter plekke wilden we die angst niet kenbaar maken we moesten onze ontgoocheling verbergen voor de atleten die nog in actie moesten komen zij moesten zich zo sereen mogelijk en zonder nog meer druk kunnen voorbereiden op hun competitie je hoort me wel niet zeggen dat tia en het team van de 4x100m daardoor een medaille hebben gewonnen
7805635 we moeten nu al starten met de voorbereiding op londen 2012 ik ga een enqu te doen bij alle belgen die in peking waren om te zien welke zaken anders kunnen of voor verbetering vatbaar zijn er zijn altijd dingen die beter kunnen een dergelijke enqu te is er in het verleden nog nooit geweest
7805636 ter plekke zijn we wel niet voor verrassingen te komen staan
7805637 we waren zeer goed voorbereid op wat ons te doen stond het was voor mij een voorrecht om vanop de eerste rij te mogen supporteren voor onze atleten in goede en kwade tijden
7805638 ik ga eerst de balans opmaken ik moet ook zien waar ik binnen vier jaar sta op professioneel en familiaal gebied er moet in belgi ook heel wat veranderen op sportniveau hoe meer er verandert in positieve zin hoe gemotiveerder ik zal zijn

7805662 the jump zone is the first element in the centre of excellence blueprint to come online theres enough to stretch hardcore bikers but with scope for the less experienced to improve their technique our goal has been to create something which is fun sustainable and offers a real challenge
7805663 dirt jumping is a grassroots sport so getting bikers involved from the start strikes the right note and allows it to develop organically its already proving a huge hit

7805676 dot statistics also show about 1 16 of every 10 000 passengers had their seats taken away outright because of overbooking which may sound like a low rate until your name is called
7805677 gives the airlines extra incentive to refine their overbooking models
7805678 travelers can now receive up to 400 if they are involuntarily bumped and rebooked on another flight within two hours after their original domestic flight time and within four hours for international they are eligible for up to 800 in cash if they are not rerouted by then the final amount depends on the length of the flight and the price paid for the ticket
7805679 compensation must be paid immediately in cash or with a voucher if the passenger accepts it and the airline must offer a choice of a refund a return flight to their departure city or an alternative flight
7805680 the announcement comes after the orlando fla based airline said it would cut flight capacity by 7 to 8 for the last quarter of the year including significant cuts to its hub at hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport
7805681 airtran had earlier said it would need to cut about 300 flight attendants and 180 pilots to reduce annual costs by about 16 million although the company generated enough requests for leaves to avoid furloughing flight attendants only about five pilots decided to take leaves
7805682 going forward airtran may seek to avoid head to head competition in atlanta and pursue more point to point flying to florida
7805683 where in the history of the west is there to be found a man who in point of influence can be compared with him
7805684 augustine is a star of extraordinary brilliancy in the apostles he has been unsurpassed
7805685 the greatest the most powerful of all the fathers him from whom proceeds all the development of the west and to whom each recurring crisis each new orientation of thought brings it back
7805686 while most of the great men in the protestant confession and their influence is therefore confined to one or the other he enjoys from both a respect equally profound and enduring
7805687 on the ground of philosopher has appeared and that is augustine
7805688 the whole life of the mystics found a sympathetic tone in his teaching its polity was to some extent the actualization of his picture of the ideas which he cherished and diffused
7805689 and once more in our own land when a reaction arose against dr puseys edition of the confessions was among the oxford movement
7805690 it would seem that the miserable of the roman empire in the west was prolonged until then only to permit augustines influence to be exercised on universal history
7805691 it is perhaps not paradoxical to say that if our age wishes to take up and treat in an independent way the problem ofreligion it is not so much to schleiermacher or
7805692 augustine has often reformation did not so easily fall into line and for a long
7805693 i consider augustine the founder of in the west this is no new discovery as kattenbusch seems to truth long since recognized by neander julius k stlin dorner schmidt etc
7805694 formerly this point was reasoned out very differently from what it is nowadays the phrases so much in use from 1830 to 1870 catholicism are now rarely met with they have since been acknowledged to be untenable although they contain a particula veri
7805695 the by three elements the third of which is augustinism the thought and the thought an absolutely decisive influence
7805696 in the fifth century at the hour when the idea of her purity and her conception unique in their kind
7805697 the ecclesiasticism of papacy to temporal rule are founded upon a tendency initiated by him
7805698 in whom are to be found more frequent contradictions than in false interpretation of augustines opinion which is frequently misconstrued by those who are not sufficiently familiar with his language and terminology 4 the character of his genius we have now to ascertain what is the dominating minds higher qualities or again the universality and the compass of his origen the grace and eloquence of basil and chrysostom whether we consider him as or as exegetist he still appears admirable the unquestioned master of all the centuries
7805699 such a rare union of the speculative talent of the greek and of the practicalspirit of the logic with such tenderness of heart
7805700 it was not merely a chance or accidental part that his mother monica played in his development and therein lies what essentially distinguishes him from christian life rather than to themselves and in a speculative fashion
7805701 his living has been incessantly relived in the course of the fifteen hundred years that have followed even to our days interior andliving as well as the mode of its expression has been essentially augustinian the also and they are by no means among the worst and even those to whom
7805702 never could augustine have exercised all the influence he has exercised if it had not been that in spite of the rhetorical artifice of his utterance absolute sincerity reigned in the inmost recesses of his

7805704 i wanted the film to basically be the opposite of the spider man movie the idea of someone getting powers and realizing they can do what they want then choosing the dark path the script i read was just too tame it just seemed a little bit americanized but timur came in with his eastern european madness and he really made it nasty he went closer to the spirit of the book
7805705 i wanted them to have those powers and then just wear those costumes for the initiation but just for one panel
7805706 and then i forgot id have liked the filmmakers to keep the supervillain mythos thats one thing im kind of sad they didnt keep cause i really liked that the idea that supervillains and heroes did exist at one point and theyre all gone now
7805707 is a fast paced crackling thrill ride tailor made for the summer audience
7805708 wanted may be the most absolutely stone bonkers crazy good movie of the century or it may be a gargantuan piece of trash chances are its a combination of the two but man does it rock

7805711 while millar may have contempt for his readers and by extension the medium in which he works at least he has his own vision and gets it across with style and wit
7805712 the films biggest faults lie in how far it strays from the source
7805713 if youve ever seen any movie about leather clad assassins you already know how this film plays out the speed and skill of the movie making balance out those faults however
7805714 stands out as a highly entertaining action film that preserves the comics core premise and cheeky attitude while taking the story into very different but still satisfying territory
7805715 it looks as if it has been written by a committee of 13 year old boys for whom penetrative sex is still only a rumour and the resulting movie plays like a party political broadcast on behalf of the misogynist party

7805755 we were looking for something that was a bit more serious more arty
7805756 for a growing number of rock and roll fans u2 have become the band that matters most maybe even the only band that matters
7805757 an overly pretentious look at u2 67 most of the albums new material was played on 1989s
7805758 sampling provided much of the album with heavy funky dance rhythms 82 released in march the album debuted at number one in 35 countries and drew mainly positive reviews 83
7805759 defied the odds and made some of the greatest music of their lives
7805760 an experience i will never forget for the rest of my life and if i had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show and have done that i think it would have been worthwhile
7805761 reapplying for the job of the best band in the world
7805762 a lot of the songs are paeans to naivet a rejection of knowingness

7805773 welcome to the greatest day of my whole entire life
7805774 i think its incredibly telling that a google search for sql server deadlocks returns nearly twice the results of a query for mysql deadlocks
7805775 what about retries i find it hard to believe that little write would take so incredibly long that a read would have to wait more than a few milliseconds at most
7805776 this episode takes a close look at transactions from different angles starting with their fundamental properties of atomicity consistency isolation durability but also investigating advanced topics like distributed or business transactions
7805777 why if it was using mvc then a select wouldnt even lock
7805778 the most powerful computational force known to parascience bistromathics is a way of understanding the behavior of numbers just as einstein observed that space was not an absolute but depended on the observers movement in time so it was realized that numbers are not absolute but depend on the observers movement in restaurants the first nonabsolute number is the number of people for whom the table is reserved this will vary during the course of the first three telephone calls to the restaurant and then bear no apparent relation to the number of people who actually turn up or to the number of people who subsequently join them after the show match party gig or to the number of people who leave when they see who else has turned up the second nonabsolute number is the given time of arrival which is now known to be one of those most bizarre of mathematical concepts a recipriversexclusion a number whose existence can only be defined as being anything other than itself in other words the given time or arrival is the one moment of time at which it is impossible that any member of the party will arrive recipriversexclusions now play a vital part in many branches of math including statistics and accountancy and also form the basic equations used to engineer the somebody elses problem field the third and most mysterious piece of nonabsoluteness of all lies in the relationship between the number of items on the check the cost of each item the number of people at the table and what they are each prepared to pay for the number of people who have actually brought any money is only a subphenomenon in this field numbers written on restaurant checks within the confines of restaurants do not follow the same mathematical laws as numbers written on any other pieces of paper in any other parts of the universe
7805779 how the he l did that happen were not even in a transaction
7805780 i get that but i dont understand why simple read selects need to lock at all i mean maybe if that database was storing my bank account balance in which case transactional orders are hugely important
7805781 row locking on update is a hint to the server not an instruction
7805782 ok but why doesnt sql server re issue the transaction on my behalf then
7805783 except when a database is being recovered snapshot transactions do not request locks when reading data snapshot transactions reading data do not block other transactions from writing data transactions writing data do not block snapshot transactions from reading data
7805784 oh they fixed that in the new version that you may never transition to for the next two years rather than saying something constructive i do
7805785 how can a read be blocked by a write what possible contention could there be from merely reading the data
7805786 its always a little disturbing to see a well known coder ask a dumb question
7805787 i think you misunderstand what a deadlock really is a deadlock is not a lock that is taking a long time it is a lock that will never be released until one of the two processes is killed
7805788 i get that but i dont understand why simple read selects need to lock at all
7805789 its always a little disturbing to see a well known coder ask a dumb question but come on database locks
7805790 but i cant help thinking our particular database vendor just isnt as optimistic as they perhaps should be
7805791 with nolock read uncommitted dirty reads data may be out of date at the time you read it but its never wrong or garbled or corrupted in a way that will crash you
7805792 the goal of providing a dirty read is to supply a nonblocking read whereby queries are not blocked by and do not block updates of the same data however oracle database doesnt need dirty reads to achieve this goal nor does it support them dirty reads are an implementation other databases must use to provide nonblocking reads
7805793 why should my database need to lock on a read
7805794 begin transaction select from table select again from same table the second select may have different results than the first whether this is a problem is up to you but sql server has to assume by default it might be so by default it is more cautious
7805795 its always a little disturbing to see a well known coder ask a dumb question but come on database locks this is very basic stuff
7805796 i know the framework will garbage collect but things work better when i dispose of my own trash
7805797 3 anybody recommending nolocks should be on an it no hire list you are making bugs why not simply store all your data in ascii flat files and get your wrong answer even faster

7805897 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come

7805911 we were going to put everything together and make a big potash play and ipo it here in toronto the concerns obviously are that canada sells a lot of potash to brazil and the price is very high the brazilians want to develop their own assets were looking at ways to help the brazilian government and the farmers of brazil in this regard
7805912 signed a document compromising to sell the assets to a canadian company however the high administration of petrobras due to strategical reasons decided not to continue with the sales
7805913 our plan is and has always been to create a brazilian potash play that will help the farmers of brazil because it will eventually help save the transportation costs between canada and brazil
7805914 our reaction right now is lets wait and see what happens in toronto and if thats positive as we all expect it will be we can look at other markets

7805926 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures

7805992 i was catholic but from the start it seemed that islam gave more answers to my questions was more direct without mysteries and making it easier for me to understand what it meant to believe in god
7805993 i remember getting in trouble in catholic school for debating things like the concept of original sin at a really young age when i actually studied islam it made it all simple
7805994 i always wanted to read the bible and learn more but it was all about the catechism you just have to believe it not understand it for me islam gave me answers made sense
7805995 with islam it was so pure i found there were no intermediaries everything goes straight to god
7805996 ask a child and he will tell you that god is one period ask a theologian how many gods there are and he will have you going in circles

7806023 hoewel van veluw financieel goed gezond is was in dit geval niet te voorkomen dat er vreemd kapitaal in het bedrijf kwam
7806024 elke medaille die daar vandaan komt heeft hetzelfde uitgangspunt door die manier van werken kunnen zij veel goedkoper leveren

7806026 zon 90 procent van alle vierdaagsen in nederland voorzien we van medailles
7806027 deze medailles zijn elk jaar hetzelfde dus ze kunnen prima worden gemaakt tijdens de rustige zomermaanden in 2006 werd de tocht plotseling afgebroken omdat er slachtoffers vielen vanwege het warme weer toen bleef de nijmeegse vierdaagse ineens met een enorme berg medailles zitten veertigduizend stuks leg je niet zomaar even in een kastje voor het jaar erop
7806028 in mei is deze prijs voor beste ondernemer van het jaar uitgereikt door prins willem alexander voor het geval er iets met het paard zou gebeuren gaf de organisatie opdracht er twee te maken mocht het eerste paard iets overkomen was er in ieder geval een reserve exemplaar bij zon belangrijke of bijzondere opdracht maken we er overigens ook een extra voor onszelf

7806031 vrienden niets kon mij weghouden van deze bijeenkomst ik ben hier om erop aan te dringen dat wij amerikas toekomst herstellen onder leiding van president barack obama
7806032 ontzettend moedig van hem om hier te verschijnen ondanks zn ziekte het typeert de man en de soort leiders die amerika nodig heeft
7806033 hij is een geweldige man niet alleen als senator die zich altijd inzet voor de sociaal zwakkeren maar ook als oom voor familieleden als iemand in de problemen zit kun je altijd rekenen op wijze raad plus een liefdevolle knuffel
7806034 toen ik barack ontmoette bleek hoe verschillend onze jeugd was geweest maar ook hoezeer wij waren opgegroeid in het gemeenschappelijk erfgoed van de amerikaanse droom
7806035 een droom die wij moeten doorgeven aan onze kinderen voor wie wij een betere toekomst moeten opbouwen

7806041 punjabis are the ones who spend the most they live life king size that is the reason why everyone should be in punjab
7806042 theres good scope in punjab punjabi weddings have a lot of extravaganza they are characterized by a lot of functions people want a lot of variety thats why we are targeting punjab
7806043 we are starting exhibition from ludhiana as we feel that the highest wedding expenditure is made in the punjab segment they are extravagant and a lot of functions are a part of it that starts well in advance
7806044 the benefit of such exhibition is that you come to one place and you are done with everything from clothes to jewellery all small details are taken care of
7806045 in one day less than one roof one can plan a wedding one gets everything from furniture jewellery to clothes

7806054 its been a crazy camp ive never had one like this said third year coach darrell asberry who conducted a kind of football boot camp with more contact and conditioning than usual
7806055 we still have to fill voids with young guys in the offensive line coach michael costa said
7806056 but weve made great strides guys understand the offense now
7806057 in order to grow and do what we want in terms of a scholarship standpoint there are going to have to be some games where you bring in some revenue
7806058 and revenue affects everything you do and i can honestly say that we have some games that are going to pay us better than weve ever been paid before
7806059 we have more depth at every position offense defense and special teams

7806063 energy markets have not yet focused on what this latest escalation could mean for a potential disruption in energy supplies
7806064 until we get better clarity on this latter issue we expect the price reverberations from this situation to be relatively contained
7806065 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong stand alone value proposition for shareholders

7806270 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a champions league qualifier i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team
7806271 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
7806272 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg but you have to remember that they had gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
7806273 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
7806274 its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
7806275 we lost at home to ak graz in the year we won the competition and had a narrow win in the last minute against maccabi haifa two years ago so anyone thinking well win comfortably knows thats very dangerous
7806276 i believe im at the top of my game right now and like any player i want to win things
7806277 when you win in three sets it is a good results
7806278 i had some difficult moments in the match so that is going to help me be prepared for the pressure moments later on

7806280 he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running
7806281 it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7806282 in the first set i felt like i was playing against a wall
7806283 in the second set i told myself to just play your game and dont give up
7806284 it is tough to play opponent who doesnt have anything to lose

7806368 it was probably the worst one day international we have played in two years england certainly played well but we were more disappointed in our performance weve got to improve in all departments england probably scored 25 runs too many and from a batting point of view we lost wickets at key moments
7806369 and certainly we werent up to standard in the field there is a lot of work to be done in all three departments weve had a couple of days now to get out practice and chat about it hopefully we can come out and turn the tables

7806402 i dont suppose it may have occurred to you that the cecal valve feature may have been already encoded in the genetic information of the lizard and was selected due to a changed diet or manifested through interbreeding with the indigenous population or maybe nobody ever noticed it before like the aforementioned rat
7806403 changes in appearance dont prove the generation of new genetic information you can change the diet of birds to tougher seeds and the shape of their bills will change you can drink a lot of beer and the shape of your gut will change these lizards changed their diet
7806404 their gut got bigger due to a changed diet and thus we are told that

7806413 there was a security incident in peshawar this morning involving a u s consulate vehicle and three employees there were no injuries and minimal damage to the vehicle
7806414 we are coordinating with pakistani authorities in investigating the incident the consulate is open and operating normally
7806415 while conditions in the nwfp have been dangerous for some time the province has not been completely out of bounds in selective cases maybe that will have to change now
7806416 it is impossible to tell if the attack in peshawar was in retaliation to the ban but obviously it is worth asking if the taliban swiftly retaliated
7806417 the way these people are growing as a nuisance for pakistan there has to be a firm response
7806418 in the short term of course there will be lots of bloodshed but can pakistan afford a half hearted response especially when this problem is growing so rapidly
7806419 important part of what im about what makes me tick

7806423 theres a very serious land mine issue now because there are land mines being laid as we speak
7806424 theres a whole bunch of things going on right now and as we begin to move refugees from point a to point b or try to feed refugees who are stuck in pockets around the country were running into the issue of the blowing up of humanitarian vehicles that are trying to get to the refugees so its a whole morass of problems now
7806425 we went basically as an emergency team not knowing what wed be getting into
7806426 we discovered as did the kuwaitis that the iraqis had planted land mines in the playgrounds so we hadnt been there 12 hours and the first case we get is a young child who had gone outside to play on the teeter totter and stepped on a land mine that was my first experience with land mines
7806427 when people begin to run they run for places that they know are safe schools churches community centers and those are the first things that are mined

7806440 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7806441 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7806442 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7806443 its estimated that in the united states produce travels an average of 1 500 miles from farms to the homes of consumers so it just provides us an opportunity to make products closer to home and buy local
7806444 the quality i have i dont do any markets like that just because my stuff is picked ripe and the only shelf i want it on is between here and the customer at home
7806445 and sitting in any retail store is just not good for my produce
7806446 if people decide theyre going to consume locally that means theyre probably not consuming our walnuts and apricots and almonds and everything else we grow around here

7806450 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7806451 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7806452 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7806453 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7806454 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7806455 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7806456 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7806457 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7806458 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7806459 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7806460 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7806461 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7806462 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7806463 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7806464 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7806465 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7806466 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7806467 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7806468 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7806469 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7806470 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7806471 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7806472 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7806473 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7806474 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7806475 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7806476 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7806477 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7806478 25 percent of the energy used to heat and cool buildings goes right out the window
7806479 the innovative technologies receiving funding today will improve u s industrial competitiveness while reducing energy use helping to make our nation more secure
7806480 i really think we are buying something before we know what it can do
7806481 i am being asked to buy a 3 7 million house based on curb appeal
7806482 the beginning of knowledge is the discovery of something we do not understand
7806483 sanchez had a months worth of meds but i dont know over what period he didnt take them
7806484 even though their mouth and their nose and so on is open they cant breathe
7806485 and the fact that you are not able to make a noise and youre maybe making some mumbling noises i guess in my head i would say well you know do weve got an airway problem or what i mean there is something going on

7806488 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7806489 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7806490 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7806491 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7806492 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7806493 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7806494 we would have been here earlier if it werent for putting finishing touches on the shuttle
7806495 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7806496 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7806497 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7806498 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7806499 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7806500 we really want the public to come out and celebrate with us because we have been a part of the community for all these years
7806501 solve your troops and the councils monetary problems by selling lots of cookies
7806502 so the sept 13 event mainly is meant to be fun and a celebration of good memories

7806505 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7806506 im glad to be back im here now that was in the past i wouldnt even say i was close to leaving
7806507 i agree that they are one of the best in the nation and they are one of the best ive had
7806508 i have great faith in these kids and i know theyre going to come through and theyre going to help lead this team
7806509 over the years growing is something we take pride in
7806510 as a unit were close knit we consider ourselves a family as well as the entire defense
7806511 everybody can hit everybody can sack the quarterback everybody can make a tackle its just overall athletic ability and the drive its everything built into one
7806512 weve got to live up to the hype i guess you could say
7806513 we have to prove ourselves each game and have a purpose and thats being the best defense out there
7806514 not only do we now have three times the floor space its more convenient for our customers
7806515 all the staff except one who just had a baby moved with me to the new location
7806516 even elaine will be working on mondays so she will also still be around
7806517 she heard my yelling and would come up and help me save a dropped stitch
7806518 i want every knitter to know they can come in here and find just what they want and what they can afford
7806519 in practice it refers to the advocation of the use of threats of or actual force against other countries in order to safeguard what they perceive as their countrys national interests and colloquially to excessive bias in judging ones own country as superior to others

7806521 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
7806522 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants
7806523 even in a slower economy the demand is still strong for college level hiring
7806524 the millennials bring a lot of energy to companies and they are more moldable and trainable than prospective employees with more work experience
7806525 also many industries are recognizing that a huge contingent of their baby boomers will retire in the next five to 10 years and they want to pass that institutional knowledge on to new leaders
7806526 talkin bout my generation getting new hampshires multi generational work force to work for you
7806527 this new national center will help move schools universities and training facilities nationwide into the 21st century
7806528 americas reputation as an international leader rests in the hands of our youth and it should be among our top priorities to provide our students with the tools they need to maintain and build upon this standing
7806529 for the first time education research will benefit from the kinds of creative research management that has been so effective in driving innovation in other parts of the economy
7806530 as i worked with more and more people i saw lots of healing happen
7806531 its an amazing thing its so powerful its so simple and it doesnt have side effects
7806532 i cant change their beliefs or their desires but i can certainly help them make changes
7806533 a patient will typically approach a procedure with apprehension and anxiety placing the immune system under stress this is not a good beginning
7806534 by relaxing the mind and body can be at their best
7806535 i can help thousands maybe millions of people and its also cost effective
7806536 some people do it at night before they go to sleep
7806537 they themselves have claimed responsibility of several suicide attacks and the government cannot engage in a dialogue with such people
7806538 pakistans leadership has clearly stated their commitment to pursuing and eliminating terrorism and securing pakistans borders for the benefit of its own citizens
7806539 our organization is neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts

7806547 me preguntaba cu les eran tus pel culas favoritas a ver si no conozco alguna y as veo pelis este verano
7806548 i dont think this will have a major impact on housing because many people will just downgrade moving from a large single family unit to something thats smaller and more manageable
7806549 but there will be an impact on health care the only sector of our economy thats shown significant job growth and which is still growing is health care and education baby boomers and others are living longer and theyll want access to care there should be growth in that sector for the forseeable future nationally as well as locally
7806550 a lot of life extension has been the extension of disabled life not of a good life people are living longer but not always in great shape we want people to live not only longer but healthier

7806560 die geringen abbestellungskosten im vergleich des norbert darabos mit eads bzw der jadgflugzeuge gmbh beweisen dass die m glichkeit eines stornos milliarden euro f r eine steuerreform freimachen w rden auch ein etwaiger weiterverkauf ist im bereich des m glichen wenn der politische wille vorhanden ist ich fordere daher meine partei auf um dieses milliardengrab doch noch zu verhindern und ihre eigene glaubw rdigkeit zu 100 wiederherzustellen diesen weg zu gehen und dies mit einem entschlie ungsantrag bei der n chsten nr sitzung zu untermauern die chance lebt zeigt doch den verdrossenen und entt uschten dass wir es ernst meinen steuerreform finanziert durch eurofighterausstieg
7806561 die senkung der mwst auf lebensmittel ist sozial nicht treffsicher und man hat nicht einmal die garantie dass lebensmittel billiger werden weil niemand gezwungen werden kann die preise zu senken nur weil die mwst sinkt nach ein paar monaten werden die preise wieder dort sein wo sie heute sind daher steuerreform f r kleine und mittelstand 2009 finanziert durch eurofighterausstieg das muss eine glaubw rdige sozialdemokratie fordern
7806562 europa braucht eine gemeinsame einwanderungspolitik bei der es zu einer gerechten verteilung von kosten und verantwortung kommt

7806564 denn es gibt europaweit gro e ngste vor dem unbekannten und fremden besonders ausgepr gt ist das was die folgen und auswirkungen von migration auf das europ ische sozialmodell betrifft diese sorgen m ssen wir ernst nehmen und politisch l sungen erarbeiten die diese ngste nehmen

7806588 steirisches bz fordert 4 punkte sofortma nahmen zur entlastung der steirer
7806589 die teuerung greift immer mehr um sich jeder redet von rekordinflation aber keiner tut etwas dagegen die leidtragenden dieser politischen hilflosigkeit sind vor allem sozial schw chere steirerinnen und steirer die vier punkte die wir vorschlagen k nnten rasch und unkompliziert von sp und vp landesautonom beschlossen werden und w rden einen ersten schritt in die richtige richtung darstellen wir d rfen nicht mehr zuwarten bis sich die streithansln faymann und molterer auf bundesebene geeinigt haben sondern es ist die verdammte pflicht dass die steiermark jetzt rasch f r seine eigenen landsleute handelt
7806590 die menschen k nnen sich das heizen nicht mehr leisten der heiz lpreis ist um unglaubliche 35 prozent gestiegen die erh hung der steuern auf heiz le um 3 6 cent pro liter tun ihr briges hier kann das land mit einer verdoppelung der heizkostenzusch sse sofort entgegenwirken und gerade sozial schwachen und lteren menschen unter die arme greifen die gesamtausgaben f r die heizkostenzusch sse neu w rden h chsten 2 8 millionen euro betragen
7806591 sowohl voves als auch nagl haben eine erh hung der strompreise in abrede gestellt
7806592 alle diese ma nahmen haben wir durchgerechnet dieses sofortpaket w rde dem land gesamte 13 millionen euro kosten aber allein bei der ffnung der landestankstellen deren adaptierung h chsten 70 000 euro kosten kann einen entlastungsnutzen von 30 millionen euro die n chsten drei jahre bringen wenn ich mir ansehe f r welche bl dheiten das land steuergeld aus dem fenster wirft sind 13 millionen euro wahrlich wenig im gegensatz zu der sozialpolitischen wirkung die wir hier f r die sozial schw cheren steirerinnen und steirer ausl sen
7806593 sozialdemokratische bildungspolitik mehr chancengleichheit und besserer unterricht f r unsere kinder
7806594 dass norbert darabos vor ende der untersuchungsausschusses den politischen auftrag hatte die st ckzahl um jeden preis also auf kosten der steuerzahler und der sicherheit zu reduzieren beweisen seine unwahrheitsgem en aussagen ber ein alternatives angebot der eurofighter gmbh ohne st ckzahlreduzierung mit reduzierten logistikleistungen
7806595 der jet hersteller bot mir 200 millionen euro rabatt aber ohne st ckzahlreduktion darauf bin ich vom verhandlungstisch aufgestanden und gegangen
7806596 ein verteidigungsminister welcher gegen ber dem parlament und dem rechungshof die unwahrheit sagt um seine eigene unf higkeit zu kaschieren ist mehr als r cktrittsreif dadurch hat die sp ihre glaubw rdigkeit in bezug auf parlamentarische kontrolle endg ltig verloren die vp ist daher aufgefordert antr gen der opposition die darabos das misstrauen aussprechen zuzustimmen um bei ihrer eigenen kritik an darabos nicht unglaubw rdig zu werden
7806597 zudem m ssen durch das parlament die zahlreichen offenen fragen behandelt werden entweder in einem unterausschuss des rechnungshofausschusses oder in einem untersuchungsausschuss warum sagte darabos die unwahrheit ber das alternative angebot warum gibt es keine dokumentation ber die verhandlungen im mai und juni warum wurden dem rechnungshof unterlagen vorenthalten warum wurden dienststellen in verteidigungsministerium informationen vorenthalten es besteht der begr ndete verdacht dass darabos auf kosten der steuerzahler seine politische vorgabe der st ckzahlreduktion erreichen wollte und dies musste geheim gehalten werden
7806598 die josefstadt ist mit gro en veranstaltungsr umlichkeiten nicht gerade gesegnet sollten eventuell durch einen neuen besitzer nun jene des palais auersperg nicht mehr zur verf gung stehen so w re das ein schwerer verlust f r das ffentliche kulturleben in diesem bezirk
7806599 im sinne der anrainer muss der park erhalten bleiben und darf nicht zweckentfremdet werden das palais mit dieser gr noase ist eines der wahrzeichen unseres bezirkes ein neuer eigent mer kann aber auch eine neue chance f r diese institution bedeuten
7806600 die zukunft und die chancen des l ndlichen raumes in sterreich h ngen insbesondere auch von seiner infrastruktur ausstattung ab investitionen in die breitband technologie sind das fundament f r eine moderne informationsgesellschaft und bringen positive wachstumseffekte nicht nur in den vor und nachgelagerten bereichen der telekom branche sondern erzeugen auch multiplikatoreffekte in anderen sektoren rund die h lfte des wirtschaftswachstums in sterreich stammt aus informations und kommunikationstechnologie
7806601 eine ungeheure chance f r den l ndlichen raum liegt in der verbindung von nachhaltiger wirtschaftsweise intakten lebensgrundlagen und modernster technologie
7806602 der l ndliche raum in sterreich umfasst ber 90 der fl che unseres landes mehr als die h lfte aller einwohner n mlich rund 4 5 mio menschen wohnen hier die l ndlichen regionen sind in sterreich im gegensatz zu vielen anderen l ndern ein wettbewerbsf higer lebens arbeits und wirtschaftsstandort damit dies auch k nftig so bleibt und um einer abwanderung entgegenzuwirken fordern wir offensive strategien zur st rkung dieser regionen
7806603 die breitband offensiven der vergangenen jahre waren ein wichtiger impuls eine mit eur 500 mio dotierte fortf hrung dieser initiative wurde im regierungsprogramm festgelegt gekommen ist aber nichts denn der zust ndige infrastrukturminister werner faymann hat keine aktionen in diese richtung gesetzt
7806604 es gibt immer noch wei e flecken in sterreich die nicht mit breitband versorgt sind ziel muss es sein alle b rger innen mit dieser wichtigen kommunikationstechnik zu versorgen und sie an den sich daraus ergebenden m glichkeiten und chancen teilhaben zu lassen daher ist ein gleicher leistbarer und barrierefreier zugang zu breitband internet notwendig
7806605 w ren die eur 500 mio aus der breitband offensive investiert worden h tte bereits ein drittel dieser knotenpunkte ausgebaut werden k nnen
7806606 im j ngsten report wird festgestellt dass sterreich im bereich informations und kommunikationstechnologie ikt im internationalen vergleich zur ckf llt dabei wird genau dieser bereich als besonders wichtiger standortfaktor gewertet
7806607 der stillstand der in der weiterentwicklung einiger infrastrukturbereiche wahrgenommen wird muss berwunden werden
7806608 vor allem in diesem bereich muss die finanzierung an die zusammenarbeit mehrerer gemeinden gekn pft werden
7806609 eine funktionierende infrastruktur der zugang zu neuen kommunikationstechnologien und die gerechte verteilung der finanzmittel sind daher zur st rkung des lebens und wirtschaftsraumes l ndlicher raum unumg nglich
7806610 sollte tats chlich ein senkung der mehrwertsteuer auf lebensmittel beschlossen werden ist es f r den handel selbstverst ndlich diese senkung an den kunden weiterzugeben
7806611 es ist v llig klar dass sich der lebensmittelhandel auch in dieser frage fair zu seinen kunden verhalten wird
7806612 faymann streut sterreichern sand in die augen und glaubt offenbar dass er sie damit blenden kann
7806613 eine wahlkampftaktische beruhigungspille mit bitterem beigeschmack bitterer beigeschmack deshalb weil die sp bereits in der vergangenheit mannigfaltig gelegenheit gehabt h tte die bev lkerung zu entlasten die entsprechenden antr ge dazu hat die fp immer wieder eingebracht
7806614 existenznotwendige g ter sollen nach ansicht der fp von der mehrwertsteuer ausgenommen werden weil sie damit die unteren einkommensschichten st rker belasten als die oberen angesichts der inflationsentwicklung ist der kampf gegen die armut immer notwendiger
7806615 dass sterreich bei der mehrwertsteuer auf medikamente im europ ischen vergleich mit 20 prozent auf dem zweiten platz liegt
7806616 durch eine nderung der eu mehrwertsteuer richtlinie soll eine halbierung des mehrwertsteuersatzes von 20 prozent auf 10 prozent erm glicht werden
7806617 da die energiepreise weiter hoch bleiben steigen auch die einnahmen ber die mehrwertsteuer und daher ist es nur mehr als gerecht wenn dieser mehrerl s an die wirtschaft zur ckgegeben wird eine deutliche reduktion der mehrwertsteuer f hrt aus sicht der fp zum vorteil f r alle denn mehr kaufkraft bringt mehr wirtschaftswachstum und damit auch mehr steuern f r den bundeshaushalt
7806618 faymann geht es mit seinem f nf punkte programm nicht wirklich um den kampf gegen die inflation und steigende armut er streut mit seinem paket den sterreicher nur sand in die augen und glaubt wirklich dass er sie damit blenden kann
7806619 die w hler wissen aber ganz genau dass das nur wahlzuckerl sind um zu retten was nicht mehr zu retten ist

7806623 if it really is the happiest place on earth as the ads say why do so many children come out looking disappointed just look at their faces kids know when theyve been cheated
7806624 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7806625 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7806626 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7806627 i have to say something a little controversial which ill probably regret
7806628 when i go back into england and i go through heathrow airport im ashamed to be english
7806629 valencia is an area that is not the gateway to their country and yet the local government showed vision to stage the americas cup to commit all the resources they did to turn it into a world class venue
7806630 we also know how they embraced the concept of us launching our car there
7806631 they made available to us all the facilities that exist in the arts and science park contributed to the venue and we were a catalyst to the grand prix
7806632 to see what theyve done demonstrates what you can do if you are committed as a government local or national
7806633 valencia is a testament to how you should do it
7806634 i applaud the efforts of valencia theyve gone the right way about it theyve committed to putting in the infrastructure to getting the resources right
7806635 next year they just need to put in some more colour the harbour needs to be full of boats more signage and a bit more glitz but theyve got it the right way round
7806636 ill be absolutely amazed if we dont go to singapore and have the same experience next month this is what it takes
7806637 it requires government support and to me it is a textbook example of what you can do if you all point in the same direction and have the commitment
7806638 for me i cant understand the ridiculous squabble we are having in england over the issue of relatively small amount of money with regard to the funding of the olympic games
7806639 we should be proud weve got the olympic games and we should be pushing and reflecting in attitude the efforts of all the people who went there and surpassed everybodys expectation with regard to the medals our country have won
7806640 unfortunately we seem to be the worlds best at turning around and being unconstructively critical
7806641 i know stories will be written with my comments but i dont care
7806642 our woeful lack of success on the track our inability to erect and man a stand to promote 2010 at beijing and our embarrassing loss to new zealand last week probably comes down to the fact that we are a nation of losers and proud of it
7806643 we see it as an investment opportunity as the fair value ofthe stock is much more than the current market price
7806644 we are sending a message that we believe in the stock
7806645 its a good decision for cricket and we are pleased it was unanimous we look forward to dealing with our international colleagues over the details of when the tournament will be postponed to
7806646 mit der kombination von fernsehen internet und telefonie entsprechen wird genau dem zeitgeist die erfolgreiche einf hrung von f i t im fr hjahr 2008 und das gro e interesse haben uns gezeigt dass wir hier ein attraktives paket geschn rt haben mit der ausweitung der triple play aktion k nnen wir jetzt noch mehr auf die bed rfnisse unserer kunden eingehen die drei ma geschneiderten f i t angebote helfen unseren kunden aber auch geld zu sparen fernsehen internet und telefonie bei upc bekommen kunden alles aus einer hand und zu top konditionen
7806647 we dont know right now because thats what goldman isdoing
7806648 why dont we take a ride to lexington and you can research it there
7806649 i said earlier my experience may help a little and that definitely may have been the difference on one or two points in the match
7806650 right now its a matter of how fresh i can stay for this tournament

7806760 the recent decline in global oil prices will not help cool consumer price inflation in india because energy prices subsidised by the government are still well below international market levels
7806761 until next june energy prices will also remain notably higher on a year ago basis because of the cut in subsidies two months ago
7806762 the rise in global commodity and food prices is still a major driver of inflation in india the retreat of oil will only help ease the pressure on the government to further raise domestic energy prices
7806763 if growth fails to meet the projection of the rbi policymakers will be less likely to further tighten monetary policy despite high inflation

7806808 the hard thing is getting people to be honest and not have it be a fluff piece because thats not what were trying to do im trying to paint a realistic picture of who my father is i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy yeah my dad can be that guy but its not him i think that almost discredited who he is as an artist my dads not an idiot hes nothing short of a genius in my opinion he does have huge flaws and were trying to really paint an honest picture of that

7806846 the young man had spent about five weeks in hastings and was due to return home next weekend his death is incredibly sad

7806861 the territory of crimea now part of ukraine was conquered and controlled many times throughout its history the cimmerians greeks iranians goths huns bulgars khazars the state of kievan rus byzantine greeks kipchaks and the mongols all controlled crimea in its early history in the 13th century it was partly controlled by the venetians and by the genoese these were followed by the crimean khanate and ottoman empire in the 15th 18th centuries the russian empire in the 18th 20th centuries the russian sfsr and later ukrainian ssr within soviet union in the rest of 20th century germany in world war ii and now the independent ukrainian state
7806862 since the crimean tatars were forcibly deported from their homeland in may 1944 by stalin other people particularly russians settled the peninsula and took control of the lands formerly belonging to the crimean tatars after the fall of the soviet union crimean tatars were allowed by ukraine to return to crimea but conflict arose when they demanded the return of land seized after their deportation
7806863 russia in recent years amended its constitution to give itself the right to militarily intervene on behalf of ethnic russians wherever they might be in the former soviet empire
7806864 the danger is that some frustrated tatars might take up weapons from extremists muslims or be duped into doing that by russian intelligence
7806865 if they carried out an attack against ethnic russians moscow would have its excuse to annex crimea by contending that ukraine is unable to defend russian citizens

7806877 came out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
7806878 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
7806879 of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
7806880 but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet
7806881 it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye
7806882 i just find it really disconcerting that people have to focus on the negative and that some people are sooooo bored with their own lives that they need to manifest lies to hurt another person
7806883 i love the ronsons theyre close to my and i respect all the work they do
7806884 with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up

7806893 let me put it this way it made me doubt the breakup story because there is no way she was blue in any way she was really happy there was no hint of any problems
7806894 hes at the height of his career and very focused different things are important to them both right now
7806895 shes great shes also 22 years old i think people forget that
7806896 with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
7806897 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true
7806898 i love the ronsons theyre close to my and i respect all the work they do
7806899 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7806900 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete in the icc champions trophy had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7806901 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7806902 it was agreed pakistan would retain the right to host the event next year but that if at a certain time any members still had reservations then the iccs board would have the right to relocate the event
7806903 every one of our members wishes to ensure the icc champions trophy is a world class event and the prospect of relocating it at short notice in order to make sure it was played this year would not allow that criterion to be fulfilled
7806904 this presidential election has ignited so many young people to become more involved

7806928 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7806929 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7806930 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7806931 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7806932 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7806933 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7806934 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7806935 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7806936 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7806937 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7806938 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7806939 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7806940 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7806941 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7806942 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7806943 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7806944 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7806945 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7806946 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7806947 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7806948 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7806949 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7806950 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7806951 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7806952 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7806953 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7806954 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

7806963 there is no mention of rs 99 per person for cacellation
7806964 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7806965 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7806966 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7806967 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

7806970 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7806971 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7806972 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7806973 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7806974 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7806975 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7806976 who are open to doing something on the production side
7806977 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7806978 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7806979 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

7807004 it is still early in the season so there is no need to rest players some of them have been away with internationals and maybe there will be a reason for giving them a breather
7807005 everyone is fighting for their place and someone who might get a place in the carling cup does exceptionally well and stays in the team for saturday
7807006 i think the confidence is high from the way the team played on saturday there is no problem with confidence
7807007 but it is not easy to go to hartlepool and get a win i wouldnt be disrespectful to hartlepool and say we are going to go there and score lots of goals
7807008 they are a decent team work extremely hard and have got some good individuals it is a tough game for us no one should be thinking we are going to go there and score a bagful of goals
7807009 it might be the case but we are anticipating a tough game
7807010 we have got absolutely nothing to lose and it can give us a big boost in confidence should we get something out of the game
7807011 i hope teams arent looking forward to coming to the vic and they are coming here with a little bit of trepidation
7807012 we have got to earn the right to keep it like that but throughout the game against stockport on saturday we played well and their goalkeeper was inspired at times
7807013 we showed great endeavor great enthusiasm and in the end we just fell short
7807014 they snatched it and the way they played meant it was going to be tight for us and they had 11 men behind the ball every time we attacked

7807089 this is a tree this is the sun this is a house and a man
7807090 i want them to draw from their imagination they can choose the subject that they want and the material too
7807091 i draw that question mark in order to ask why why are my friends getting killed
7807092 this is a play but its also reality because there are children playing on the streets and car bombs do kill them we have not enjoyed our childhood we stay at home and watch cartoons
7807093 its estimated that in the united states produce travels an average of 1 500 miles from farms to the homes of consumers so it just provides us an opportunity to make products closer to home and buy local
7807094 the quality i have i dont do any markets like that just because my stuff is picked ripe and the only shelf i want it on is between here and the customer at home
7807095 and sitting in any retail store is just not good for my produce
7807096 if people decide theyre going to consume locally that means theyre probably not consuming our walnuts and apricots and almonds and everything else we grow around here
7807097 now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain
7807098 disappointed in the sense that i believe that hillary clinton would have been a spectacular president and i believe in her personally in every way
7807099 but content in the fact that we have a very good candidate
7807100 i think what we have to do and to the extent that i can influence this im going to try is to get obama into areas where he hasnt closed the sale
7807101 no more college campuses hes closed the sale on college campuses lets get him into vfw halls lets get him into factories and have him answer questions and people will see how smart and how well versed and how human a person he is and well be converting people
7807102 barack has brought a lot of new people into the voter registration rolls because hes been a different type of candidate and i think there was a real desire to run this campaign on a higher plane
7807103 but when youre getting smacked day after day after day with one wise ass commercial one innuendo after another there comes a time when youve got to strike back boom smack them back if theyre going to say we flip flop smack em back
7807104 you know the ad that mccain has out now about hillary clinton and what she said about obama and that obama dissed her by not picking her for vice president well that ad will have a three day half life
7807105 by wednesday morning after hillarys speech tuesday night that ad will be history hillary will make it clear to every one of her voters what she wants them to do and thats to support barack obama
7807106 she can do it in eight years because shell only be 68 shell be a young and vital 68 so i think hillary can have her shot even after barack obama is president of the united states
7807107 i came out of playing in coffeehouses and bars so really just as a performer that was kind of a survival mechanism
7807108 because you had to be heard over a crowd or playing in between the bands that people actually came to see so the humor was something that just sort of helped me get peoples attention i guess
7807109 i had some pretty eccentric neighbors and a lot of what i encountered in life at the time went right into the songs
7807110 the way a lot of my songs are written i write the music first and i record it and then with a song like modern guilt i just get on the microphone and i write something really quick sort of off the top of my head so i can remember the melody
7807111 and what happens a lot of times is that what i initially sing on there ends up being on the record a lot of these things i dont really get to spend too much time figuring out what it is
7807112 i used to hang out with a lot of poets and people who did spoken word so i think i thought my rap quote rap songs were coming from that
7807113 my grandfather was an artist and he came up in new york in the 40s and 50s
7807114 and he spoke in that kind of zoot suit hipster lingo of that time you know the beats and i think i had a lot of influence from him
7807115 he had a lot of made up words or what seemed to be made up words
7807116 he was just riffing all the time you know it was broken down traffic miasma we boogied uptown over here and whatnot and this and that it was all just rolling off of his tongue
7807117 but really it was that he was broke he couldnt afford art materials so i think he decided early on im going to make art out of what i have around which was candy wrappers and cigarette butts when i was a child he used to send us to the garbage can when we were at a restaurant wed go to all the ashtrays that were left we used to collect all the cigarette butts for him for his artwork
7807118 its estimated that in the united states produce travels an average of 1 500 miles from farms to the homes of consumers so it just provides us an opportunity to make products closer to home and buy local

7807151 two of our first big clients in the space were makro www morkels mobi which have used mobisites and mms campaigns to reach out to consumers
7807152 subsequently retailers like lewis and woolworths are signing up for mobisites as a way to reach out to current and potential customers
7807153 retailers realised that with approximately 30 million mobile phone subscribers in the country the mobile channel is the biggest channel available to market their services to mobisites and mms campaigns have therefore become a growing part of their marketing strategy
7807154 half the money i spend on advertising is wasted the trouble is i do not know which half
7807155 many retailers are decreasing or completely cutting out tv and radio advertising from their strategies because of the cost and the inability to justify that spend again their bottom line other channels are also being questioned for the same reason
7807156 with mms the base is verified with the cellular network before it is sent out that means that there is no wastage upfront furthermore retailers can monitor campaigns as they are sent out seeing how the campaign penetrates the base and get a full report back afterwards including when messages were delivered who opened them and which recipients unsubscribed
7807157 mobisites provide even more measurability because when the person visits the site from their mobile phone the mobisite picks up the mobile phone number retailers can therefore see exactly who is visiting their site and what they are looking at
7807158 the concept can be extended using mobile business intelligence this is done using customers mobile phone number as a reference and profiling their usage of the site content and even special offers can be offered to consumers based on who they are and where their interests are
7807159 it all boils down to the fact that mobile technology is far more accessible interactive and measurable that any other channel which is why retailers are moving aggressively into the space this is opening up other technologies and services like mobile ticketing loyalty programmes and location based services in the mobile space
7807160 yet organisations rarely have adequate visibility or control of their data
7807161 the starting point is developing a robust security policy and ensuring that all employees fully understand their role and obligations in support of it through internal training and communication

7807165 if people decide theyre going to consume locally that means theyre probably not consuming our walnuts and apricots and almonds and everything else we grow around here
7807166 everyday we would see gunmen riding their cars and we were afraid they might shoot us
7807167 we come here to have fun and forget about that
7807168 i have nightmares sometimes and i have shortness of breath
7807169 i often feel panic i am always expecting that someone will attack our house at any moment
7807170 we try to ease their pains even if we manage to ease a small portion of their sadness it is something

7807226 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7807227 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7807228 we re proud to have such an impressive group of veteran executives involved with plastic jungle as we continue our exciting growth in the overall gift card market
7807229 each of these individuals has a tremendous track record of success which will benefit our company in many ways
7807230 there is absolutely no reason why the players in consumer electronics can t unite around the emerging green plug standard enabling a single external power supply to power any dc powered product
7807231 with nearly a quarter century in the consumer electronics space jay believes green plug has the right implementation and the right technology to make this standard happen globally
7807232 he s a true change agent who puts his time and energy only into areas where he believes real progress can be achieved
7807233 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7807234 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7807235 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7807236 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7807237 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7807238 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7807239 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7807240 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7807241 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7807242 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7807243 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7807244 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7807245 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7807246 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7807247 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7807248 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans

7807255 x factor needed someone with wit and grit but she couldnt even give an honest answer to nikk let alone charm her way out of the situation and to take ashley back shows complete lack of self respect
7807256 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it
7807257 i think alex jones is a crackpot with a streak of white populism
7807258 how can you stand there with your guns aimed at us waiting to arrest us when you know expletive well bush is a criminal who needs to be arrested
7807259 they must be pointed out for the traitors that they are to their own families
7807260 hey michelle malkin you still promoting fema camps for the american people
7807261 malkin is preparing the ethical skids for internment of muslim americans who are simply by virtue of their religion considered somehow less than american and deserving of a fema camp if per chance osama bin goldstein pulls off another attack
7807262 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7807263 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7807264 i eat drink sleep and even dream birds birds are my vocation as well as my avocation
7807265 despite all the talk that we hear from the democratic party here in colorado about unity the democratic party is in fact not united
7807266 these clinton supporters are very frustrated with their party they are frustrated with the way hillary clinton was treated
7807267 they are frustrated that after the primary she was not even considered for the vice presidency
7807268 all of us have been incredibly loyal democrats i came into this town with my whole democratic family and i had tears in my eyes because its a terrible thing that this party has had this rift and its a real rift and the numbers show it
7807269 is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7807270 every one of us could stand up and recite all the reasons why we must elect barack
7807271 none of this will happen if john mccain is in the white house
7807272 nothings going to unify the democrats like the republicans you just wait until they start attacking sen obama as im sure they will in ways that will stir up those of us who are democrats and cause us to recognize exactly what the choice is
7807273 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7807274 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7807275 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7807276 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7807277 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7807278 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

7807281 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7807282 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7807283 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7807284 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7807285 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7807286 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7807287 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7807288 each of these individuals has a tremendous track record of success which will benefit our company in many ways

7807300 these were the last six horses from a particularly horrific rescue project two years ago
7807301 we were committed to doing anything we could to give them a chance at a better life
7807302 hsmc handles dogs and cats but isnt set up to handle larger animals
7807303 but we are familiar with other rescue organizations in the area it seemed like a worthy project
7807304 the horses are very nervous and skittish around people at this point
7807305 its going to take some time to help them adjust to their new circumstances
7807306 economic conditions have limited the amount of money many owners have for proper care and feeding of horses
7807307 illegal drop offs and harsh treatment are on the rise
7807308 a lot of horses are being driven across the border simply to get rid of the animals owners dont want or cant afford the market for horses has fallen and the animals have become hard to sell
7807309 it makes no sense to put yourself at risk the best thing to do is contact the proper authorities
7807310 most people have compassion and want to do the right thing
7807311 the best thing to do is contact people who have hands on experience in animal rescue
7807312 there are years that ask questions and years that answer
7807313 youve got the mike stuck half way down your throat

7807315 there are many different kinds of smiles but the true genuine spontaneous smile is one where the mouth spreads in a relaxed way across the face and the eyes sparkle or soften depending on the context and meaning of the smile false smiles involve only the mouth
7807316 murals are an opportunity to bring history to life on a grand scale
7807317 they give people a way to get acquainted with local background in a very compelling manner cookes work is a significant addition to our area and a showpiece for both locals and visitors we hope many of you will come to the dedication and enjoy learning more from our storytellers and artists

7807321 mr barak has once again underlined the fact that israel cannot accept that iran acquires nuclear capability israel refuses to rule out any options
7807322 the united states must continue to impose effective economic sanctions on tehran with the goal of preventing iran from building nuclear arms
7807323 we are pushing this material to uk media channels e g a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq al qaeda leadership and supporters
7807324 and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
7807325 we are not claiming victory over aq we are stressing their declining support
7807326 my job as president is to make sure we are tightening the screws on iran diplomatically to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a different calculation
7807327 and weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is against the wall

7807340 the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7807341 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
7807342 and as i tuck that little girl and her little sister into bed at night i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7807343 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country and not just because barack has done well but because i think people are hungry for change
7807344 i just wanted to make the statement that i have and always will be proud of my country
7807345 what i was clearly talking about was that im proud in how americans are engaging in the political process
7807346 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7807347 whos never forgotten where he came from and never stopped fighting for folks who work long hours and face long odds and need someone on their side again
7807348 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country and not just because barack has done well but because i think people are hungry for change
7807349 weve moved on from our mass comm life so why cant some people just get over it

7807363 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7807364 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7807365 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7807366 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7807367 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7807368 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7807369 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

7807376 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7807377 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7807378 we are involved in serious continuous negotiations all the time there are disparities but we are not where we were a year ago
7807379 share the belief that an agreement can be reached between israel and the palestinians by the end of 2008
7807380 the younger generations interest in wrestling has been declining cricket has ruined the fate of other sports

7807382 during our time there used to be 100 wrestlers in our village but now hardly anybody takes up the sport
7807383 the administration and government need to provide financial and infrastructure facilities to the young aspirants there is only a sports ground at the primary school here but no coach
7807384 what sushil is today is due to his family his grandfather used to purchase five litres of milk daily for him his other dietary needs like ghee butter were met by the family

7807396 we need to keep him until the end of the season
7807397 for me you have to take into consideration how long a driver has been in formula 1 when you evaluate his performance
7807398 for no other reason that puts lewis top of the heap he is the best in formula 1 at the moment
7807399 if you take into account how little experience he has had thats the bit that gives him the edge
7807400 it doesnt mean to say he is particularly quicker than the others or he has dominated its just you have to take how long they have been involved in the sport as one of the values
7807401 how can you criticise him only a fool doesnt realise that irrespective of age you learn something every day
7807402 it is no different for a racing driver because they spend their whole life driving a racing car and they are going to learn more and more
7807403 with all drivers in formula 1 they are on a very steep learning curve and the longer they are in it the steeper it becomes

7807409 the game requests the player to be a hero and save black balloons by performing a number of energy saving actions such as switching off lights and appliances before the snowman melts because of the effects of climate change
7807410 we have designed this game to appeal to late primary school and early secondary school students but i think lots of adults may also enjoy playing it
7807411 the game really gives kids the understanding and empowers them by letting them know that their individual actions can reduce their impact on climate change
7807412 the recent decline in global oil prices will not help cool consumer price inflation in india because energy prices subsidised by the government are still well below international market levels
7807413 until next june energy prices will also remain notably higher on a year ago basis because of the cut in subsidies two months ago
7807414 the rise in global commodity and food prices is still a major driver of inflation in india the retreat of oil will only help ease the pressure on the government to further raise domestic energy prices
7807415 if growth fails to meet the projection of the rbi policymakers will be less likely to further tighten monetary policy despite high inflation
7807416 after raising reserve requirements twice and increasing interest rates three times to a multi year high the central bank should be now taking a wait and see stance because it takes months for monetary policy changes to affect the economy

7807437 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7807438 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7807439 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7807440 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7807441 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7807442 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7807443 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

7807459 i am honored to serve as national president during such a pivotal point in the boy scouts of americas history as we move toward our 100th anniversary in 2010
7807460 we have one of the most spectacular opportunities that were ever going to have in this 100th year for so long too long others have been defining us i think the greatest opportunity we have immediately is to define ourselves not that we dont know who we are but define ourselves to america
7807461 the boy scouts of america is enthusiastic about johns new role as national president of our organization
7807462 by drawing from his sound business experience and tenacity he will help lead us into the next generation of scouting
7807463 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7807464 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7807465 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7807466 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7807467 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

7807470 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7807471 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7807472 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7807473 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7807474 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7807475 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7807476 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7807477 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7807478 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7807479 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7807480 the beauty of this and the adjustment of the fees is that everybody who is eligible gets a place theres none of this where some people pay 877 and other people pay 8000 a year for full private cost recovery
7807481 its demand driven more will participate and the level of skills in the community will increase
7807482 some fees will stay the same and others will rise in line with the expected job opportunities and wage outcomes from engaging in one of those qualifications

7807493 it shows that some folks in the industry are desperate

7807553 when the user mouses over a book a contextual popup comes up containing information about the book and a set of associated actions part of the popup is a button menu sort of like a button and combo box widget that allows the user to provide information about what he or she did with the book the first thing to note is that combination of a button in a menu is not standard yet it makes sense because it saves a click for the most important action secondly the menu is effectively a popup within a popup which is a big no no in the classic world but works well in this context the elements of the menu are not buttons but check boxes which allow multiple selection another violation of classic user interface elements but which works very well in this context what is remarkable is how intuitive this gadget is you are interacting with it in the context of a book and each choice is simple and clear such clarity and simplicity was never present in the old interfaces clearly this new approach to uis is great and early adopters are loving it but will it cross over to the mainstream

7807670 there has been broad support and tolerance of the pad movement over the past three months largely because the government has been so poor and in so many ways unethical in its doings nevertheless i think the broad population would hope that the pad would remain a peaceful voice rather than an aggressive movement our position is that we respect the rights of people to make their opinions heard but obviously within the constraints of the law this morning was i think a breach of what was acceptable
7807671 there is no clear winner coming out of this struggle between the pro and anti thaksin camps
7807672 the stock market liquidity is shrinking along with a weakening currency and that is deterring investors from bargain hunting in thailand

7807681 we want to maintain the tradition of drinking at football games but some fans just take it too far
7807682 if we think they are drunk we are not allowing them in
7807683 were going to take their tickets and tell them to leave
7807684 last year we had over 100 drinking incidents at mackay as opposed to three or four at lawlor for football we have tailgaters and if games are starting at six we have a lot of people who start drinking at noon or even before that
7807685 if it were up to me no one would smoke at the stadium we have a lot of fans with respiratory problems and we have to think of their interests we also have to find a place for our smoking fans to go and indulge as well
7807686 we started out as individuals but well leave as brothers and sisters as we join the law enforcement family
7807687 most of them are in their 20s and theyre seeing how law enforcement would work for them

7807697 i have really gotten along with first year defensive coordinator nigel burton i think he has the ability to bring a lot of excitement to nevada
7807698 i expect him to have an outstanding year with the wolf pack this season and the rest of his career
7807699 i just called them and asked them if they wanted to play a friendly game
7807700 i cant remember the score of the last game we played them but i know we won by at least two tries rugbys equivilant to a touchdown
7807701 it will create more consistency in the past wed have a lot more time to line up and be slow
7807702 we are working to get used to it with our scrimmages and in practice
7807703 players get excited but we will get used to it
7807704 we didnt establish enough pressure in the middle of the field
7807705 we got beat on almost every 50 50 ball and we made a lot of turnovers on offense
7807706 it was our first time playing it this is going to be a learning process if we continue to play it
7807707 we had to figure a different way to adjust to it it was tough
7807708 we have to settle down and work on communication in the future we will adjust well be fine

7807725 this agreement reflects our ongoing efforts to ensure that aons colleagues capabilities and technology remain at the forefront of our industry and that we provide the best value for our clients
7807726 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7807727 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
7807728 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
7807729 as countermeasures in a situation where the united states violated the agreement
7807730 if it seems too good to be true it probably is

7807740 david borger has worked with parramatta council to develop a vision for granville town centre
7807741 he will initiate a working group to push the plans forward with the support of the department of planning
7807742 my commitment to working with parramatta council comes on top of our 18 million investment in a new railway station for granville
7807743 over the past 20 years it has become obvious that granville has lost some retail spending to surrounding areas and needs some assistance from all levels of government to grow and improve
7807744 people who experience abnormalities in the blood supply to the brain and spinal cord which could lead to death have a real chance of living normal lives because of this specialist equipment
7807745 it means patients can be home within two days and driving within a week instead of spending weeks in hospital using traditional methods
7807746 hopefully we can go there and wrap up the minor premiership with a win
7807747 i want to emphasise that this was the first place convict women were sent when they came to australia
7807748 it is only very recently that people are embracing convict history
7807749 these women deserve to be commemorated but more than that it is looking at how we treat people who are different
7807750 there will be a blessing of the bonnets ceremony and they will be on display before becoming part of a permanent display in australia
7807751 i went and saw the doctor and he said its all good just a bit of bruising
7807752 i should be all right for saturdays match against the bulldogs
7807753 all we can do is take care of ourselves and prepare properly and just hope that the rest comes
7807754 we wouldnt mind playing them every week at the moment
7807755 it is at the point now that wherever we go the supermarket or just down the street he always race walks no running
7807756 he obviously really enjoys it because it is a weird looking walk but he doesnt care what people think
7807757 he was a bit disheartened and had a sad face but once the board flashed his name up in sixth place he started jumping around like a lunatic
7807758 it was a good tight game a see saw struggle
7807759 in the end they held on to a good win but it was a good open game of football
7807760 both sides had opportunities and considering gordon look set to finish in second spot we did pretty well
7807761 my food is out of the pan not a can
7807762 we are completely booked out on friday and saturday nights a week in advance
7807763 this is an exciting step towards a new police station for the people of granville
7807764 the police station will be a main base for officers fighting crime in the region
7807765 more than 2500sq m of land has been purchased for the development of the police station which when completed will form part of the town hall precinct
7807766 they contacted us via our myspace page and asked us if we wanted to be included on a pop punk compilation album
7807767 obviously we were excited and sent over our track people vs politics and now the album is being sold in the us and was sent to 20 californian radio stations
7807768 it has given us some really good exposure and weve even had teenagers in the us who have bought the album contact us and say how much they love our music
7807769 it was a really amazing time but also very tiring and stressful
7807770 we were working 10 hour days non stop to record the seven tracks for the album
7807771 we have played them twice and they beat us by 20 points the first time
7807772 but five weeks ago we played them again and we beat them by 28 points
7807773 our chat hit home as i too was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2003 and know how tough it is
7807774 it is enough to suffer a serious illness let along having to worry about paying normal household bills and mortgages and on top of it all have to come up with the funds for treatment
7807775 auburn is an important inner western area of sydney with a large and culturally diverse population
7807776 for a start we have a large number of businesses that call auburn home over 8000 large and small businesses are located in auburn ranging from multinationals to boutique industries that utilise the large labour pool in this very central part of sydney
7807777 and our location is of prime importance auburn is located in a growth corridor and is easily accessible from all parts of sydney whichever way you look at it we qualify for city status
7807778 come and have a free halal sausage and learn more about how council is going to clean up your area
7807779 itll be a great family fun day and the kids can join in craft activities therell be recycled artwork a special puppet show with recycled characters and heaps of information on councils waste services
7807780 a taskforce of volunteers coordinates this fantastic local program and this barbecue is the first of six barbecues to promote the community pride program and provide residents with information on councils waste services
7807781 well supply the gloves and bags and then its all fun as you join new friends from noon 2pm for a free sausage sizzle vegetarians are catered for
7807782 people like bill have been the encouraging voice behind the development of our cycleways as they are today
7807783 cyclists are now able to ride from macarthur st in parramatta to wharf rd in ermington
7807784 cycling just 10 kilometres each way to work instead of driving saves you about 770 in transport costs and 1 3 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year
7807785 besides it is a great way to get out and about interacting with your neighbourhood
7807786 just recently i was made aware that there are a couple of issues of a personal nature i need to resolve and need to put everything into getting on top of it
7807787 i tried everything i could to see if it was possible to continue but every calculation indicated that i need to spend a lot of the next two years dealing with it
7807788 it was really really hard because i have loved every moment of representing the community and the south ward
7807789 it is really hard to give up something that has been so much a part of your life for the last 21 years and something you love doing
7807790 i invited four children from every school in holroyd to come out and meet the governor
7807791 that day stands out for me and i received letters from the schools saying it was something they will never forget
7807792 it is an incredible achievement for our city and i believe we are the only city in the world to say we are going to protect our kids
7807793 percy hugh roy goodwin was private 255 1st division 1st brigade 1st battalion volunteering within three weeks of the declaration of world war 1
7807794 his nickname was old dad because of his then age of 31 and he fought in the big battles including lone pine
7807795 the government of the day refused to accept his death as war caused
7807796 this not only left his wife florence and the family in a poor financial state but they were also devastated at the lack of recognition
7807797 various bodies and individuals argued his case and in march 2006 the department of veterans affairs agreed to accept that percys death was indeed war caused
7807798 i think the better side won but we really pushed them
7807799 towards the end we had scored three tries in a row and were really on a roll
7807800 we thought we had scored towards the end but that wasnt confirmed by the referee but then easts scored shortly after
7807801 we were in the game for the last five minutes
7807802 it was one of the better games played all year
7807803 outside that with four regulars out the team played well
7807804 i first wanted one when i was 18 but my dad wouldnt let me because he said it was too impractical
7807805 little wonder that i became obsessed with them in later life and now own one of each model that was ever made
7807806 we just have to always remember that what isnt paid by system development charges are paid by the rest of the ratepayers so whatever is delayed by systems development charges coul
7807807 we just have to always remember that what isnt paid by system development charges are paid by the rest of the ratepayers so whatever is delayed by systems development charges could become a burden on the rest of t
7807808 kalau kurus kesannya jadi tidak sehat lagian enggak enak dipeluknya tulang semua haha bagi saya tubuh yang sekal menunjukkan dia mampu melindungi dirinya sendiri
7807809 perempuan yang mengenakan sepatu tinggi membuat kaki terlihat lebih panjang dan seksi saya paling suka memandangi kaki perempuan
7807810 saya suka perempuan berperut ramping karena itu menandakan dia tidak hamil haha tapi sebenarnya bukan hanya itu ketika melihat perempuan perutnya rata itu berarti dia bisa mengurus diri kalau dia sudah bisa merawat dirinya dengan baik dia pasti bisa mengurus saya kelak
7807811 saya tidak terlalu peduli dia cantik atau tidak asalkan wajahnya terkesan ramah saya pasti interest apalagi jika wajahnya kekanak kanakan lucu dan penuh senyum rasanya saya akan merasa nyaman berada di dekatnya wajah seperti ini membut saya ingin selalu melindungi dia sebaliknya wajah yang jutek membuat saya ingin kabur darinya
7807812 bibir tipis dan kecil menunjukkan dia perempuan banyak bicara saya pernah menjalin hubungan dengan perempuan berbibir tipis memang dia lebih banyak bicara daripada saya haha bibir tipis sebenarnya tak masalah asal disiati dengan penggunaan lipstik merah sehingga mengesankan bibir yang penuh
7807813 i have a fast connection always play higher quality video when its available
7807814 i have a slow connection never play higher quality video
7807815 we have couple of chances carling cup and the fa cup
7807816 at the moment weve got a chance of winning the league but that may peter out as the season goes on it depends on how we play
7807817 i had my only 19 fit players against bolton at the weekend and one of those obafemi martins has picked up a groin strain
7807818 the first lesson is that you dont necessarily do everything the fans want you to do
7807819 i am a fan too and i would love to have a squad that is much better than everyone elses
7807820 we are very nearly there but not quite i think we are quite happy we are not going to buy somebody who doesnt improve the squad
7807821 i keep saying there is money available but i am not going to say how much but it is enough to buy an experienced international player
7807822 we have won one match and lost one in the league and hopefully we will be in the draw for the champions league
7807823 i keep saying there is money available but i am not going to say how much but it is enough to buy an experienced international player

7807839 sasken communication is already too much news driven the stock fell sharply from rs 350 levels to rs 90 levels and from there it recovered to around rs 200 since then it came down slightly and is consolidating since last three months between rs 130 to rs 160 levels since this consolidation zone is likely to be over a decisive closing at above rs 160 can take the stock to rs 210 plus levels buy with a small stoploss of rs 130 but this stock is likely to perform better

7807891 i am single and looking and am told by pogo chatters that i am funny i have a serious side and am very opinionated about things in our world and life in general i dont smoke and drink socially and i am a great cook
7807892 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but
7807893 i was born and raised a redneck from the south in my home town of wichita kansas but i now live in michigan i enjoy football camping occasionally visiting the casino and playing pogo games
7807894 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
7807895 the game is not about west ham and paul ince its about us getting a result
7807896 i looked at the fixtures when they came out and noticed straight away that west ham away was the third game in
7807897 and i certainly enjoyed working with south africa last year
7807898 id always be willing to give them a hand but for the next three years i have decided my future is here at saracens after that i will have a look around
7807899 no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach is talking about not successfully anyway
7807900 everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7807901 this is still a very good squad of players most are even at their peak or approaching it so there is plenty of talent but what they need is the organisation and discipline
7807902 the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
7807903 he has to change his philosophy because it doesnt fit these players its not credible
7807904 he is not injured he got taken off because i wasnt happy with his performance and he has to do better in training this week to get a place in the team next week
7807905 i think it is a whole new ball game for wes hoolahan at norwich where it is a much bigger club than blackpool
7807906 i think at blackpool he was the star of the show and i think he was allowed to basically do what he wants
7807907 well no not here he will play my way or he wont play
7807908 it was a bad goal to give away from our point of view wes hoolahan will be very disappointed and he got told that at half time
7807909 i knew what he was trying to do he was trying to lift the ball away from the defender and jump at the same time you cant do that it is a 50 50 tackle you have to win the ball you have to make the tackle
7807910 he almost looks like he is jumping out of the way not to get injured and thats totally unacceptable and wes has been told that he understands that
7807911 we can only use our seated areas so there are only seats for sale in the stand and behind the goal to the left as you look from the stand
7807912 im a bloke who hasnt played it coached it youve got to get the best deputies you possibly can
7807913 if the irish think its going to be a soft option we take and back off from being a physical side then theyre wrong
7807914 there are rules which state you can do things and we will try and stay on that line within the rules
7807915 it was just a bad day and we are thinking about qualifying at anfield
7807916 for liverpool the champions league is a huge competition and it would be a disaster not to get through
7807917 nobody in the squad is thinking about anything other than qualifying
7807918 i am always optimistic and i am convinced we will beat standard
7807919 but there are no easy games in europe and we are aware that this match is not decided
7807920 the first lesson is that you dont necessarily do everything the fans want you to do
7807921 i am a fan too and i would love to have a squad that is much better than everyone elses
7807922 we are very nearly there but not quite i think we are quite happy we are not going to buy somebody who doesnt improve the squad
7807923 i keep saying there is money available but i am not going to say how much but it is enough to buy an experienced international player
7807924 we have won one match and lost one in the league and hopefully we will be in the draw for the champions league
7807925 i keep saying there is money available but i am not going to say how much but it is enough to buy an experienced international player

7807973 my impression is that attorney santos called you precisely because you are the brother of justice sabio and not because of your concern for the members of the gsis
7807974 first time that attorney santos had called you to intercede in behalf of the government in cases pending before the court of appeals
7807975 as a lawyer did it not occur to you that there must be something wrong somewhere when attorney santos called you that a tro is prepared did you not consider it unusual
7807976 but you are a lawyer you are a practicing lawyer even during the marcos era the tro is known to attorney santos when he is not a member of the court of appeals did you not inquire from attorney santos how he came to know about the tro
7807977 you said you are not lobbying but you are trying to influence your brother
7807978 rely upon the merits of his cause and refrain from any impropriety which tends to influence or gives the appearance of influencing the court
7807979 it seems you are making these things an exception to many things you called your brother for this case even if you are bordering into something that is unethical and downright illegal you did not even think you are obstructing justice
7807980 my brother do not hesitate calling me because he was five years older then me we respect him he helped me find a career in the judiciary i owe him a debt of gratitude
7807981 because of my respect for him and his respect for me he never insisted i dont know why he is being faulted now
7807982 are you saying it is alright for a brother to call you up in connection with a case pending before the court of appeals as long as you will decide accordingly is that what you are saying
7807983 is that not dangerous relying on filipino culture in situations like this
7807984 i will be a hypocrite if i will not say what i said he is my brother if there will be consequences then so be it

7808360 we love the underdog the brits but when you drill down deep into the psyche of the individual we want to be winners
7808361 i dont think we could have contributed in any other way to exciting the nation about us becoming the next hosts of the olympic games in 2012
7808362 the whole country has woken up to the fact its us next and it is going to be a hell of a show in london in 2012

7808371 whilst thousands of people came to join in with the fun and spectacle of carnival once again the event ended with a small minority of people determined to fight and cause trouble
7808372 for over two hours our officers were faced with a hardcore mainly of young men who came to the carnival not to enjoy the event but to fight commit crime and cause trouble
7808373 officers had to work hard and deliver a strong interventionist style of policing late into the night to make sure that these criminals were not allowed to take over the streets of notting hill this is not the way anyone can want to see the carnival finish
7808374 through our stop and search use of screening wands and seizures of dangerous dogs we sent a clear message that the carnival is no place for such behaviour as this
7808375 i would say some people thought we were going to die
7808376 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7808377 it was obvious to me that there was depressurisation in the cabin but there was no announcement and no evidence of the cabin crew for most of this experience why on earth didnt they give a few more calming words to the passengers

7808416 so many of you have been with me in the happiest days and the hardest days together we have known success and seen setbacks victory and defeat

7808431 and where was the very special part in that birthday
7808432 its a strange thing visual fx supervising theres a lot of politics the client producers agency its really important to have good communication

7808434 it brings such value for the client to have us on set
7808435 what was interesting was the hand in glove relationship between the director editors and the creative editorial
7808436 wegen des steuergeheimnisses d rfen wir keine einzelheiten zu dem fall erl utern
7808437 i downloaded this video from youtube how do i play it on my ipod
7808438 when people are hurting they need biblical answers not platitudes here the editors and authors have thoroughly combed the scriptures to give us the answers we need in tough times this book should help both those who are suffering and those called upon to comfort and encourage others in their suffering
7808439 the skeptic chides if god is good he is not god if god is god he is not good with scripture to answer the pain of real life questions and with real life pain to question scripture these theologians address the hardest questions with honesty tenderness and deep truth
7808440 those who read this book will thank the gifted team of authors for their careful biblical theological philosophical and ethical engagement with the problem of suffering and evil this timely book addresses these crucial and challenging issues with clarity conviction and pastoral sensitivity readers will be strengthened edified and encouraged i highly recommend this most important book
7808441 morgan and peterson have assembled a fine community of biblical scholars and theologians all committed to christ and the church to address the problem of suffering there are no easy answers to this problem but there are plenty of wrong answers misunderstandings and confusion this book this community will point you in the right direction
7808442 this volume should be warmly embraced by readers anxious to receive realistic good news from the bible on this perennially important subject the writers are biblical pastoral reflective and honest i am grateful for their helpful and theologically rich analysis
7808443 chapter by chapter the authors root and ground their reflections in scripture modeling how to move from biblical exposition to a biblical theology the reflections are not only theoretical and necessary but also practically engaging there is much wisdom in this work and it is my prayer that it will become must reading for every serious christian who wants to learn afresh how to handle gods word rightly for todays church and to proclaim the gospel powerfully to todays world
7808444 n o nenhum segredo que comuniquei a minha colega israelense que n o acho que a atividade de assentamentos ajude o processo
7808445 as fronteiras do estado palestino e de israel ser o determinadas por um acordo
7808446 o processo de paz n o ser afetado pela atividade nos assentamentos
7808447 no final das contas a pol tica do governo de israel n o expandir os assentamentos nem construir novos assentamentos nem confiscar terras palestinas

7808450 we were a bit rusty against ballymena united and we could easily have been 2 0 down only for john connolly to make a great save
7808451 the players dug in and worked hard to get the win but the final scoreline flattered us and we will not be getting carried away with it
7808452 we have dominated games in the past and not got the result we deserved so we will keep our feet on the ground with the setanta cup starting soon teams have a busy few weeks and squad strength will be tested
7808453 what is the point in looking at league tables until the end of january then we will know who is challenging for what we have glentoran coming up on saturday as well so the challenges ahead are daunting and they demand everyones total focus
7808454 they have had a taste of europe and they will be fit as well as strong opponents
7808455 what interests me more than anything else is the idea if a person can tell me the idea in twenty five words or less its going to be a good movie

7808479 whether grazing or resting these animals face either magnetic north or south
7808480 our results call for an in depth study of this phenomenon and challenge neuroscientists biochemists and physicists to study the proximate mechanisms and biological significance of magnetic alignment

7808483 i have to say something a little controversial which ill probably regret
7808484 when i go back into england and i go through heathrow airport im ashamed to be english
7808485 valencia is an area that is not the gateway to their country and yet the local government showed vision to stage the americas cup to commit all the resources they did to turn it into a world class venue
7808486 we also know how they embraced the concept of us launching our car there
7808487 they made available to us all the facilities that exist in the arts and science park contributed to the venue and we were a catalyst to the grand prix
7808488 to see what theyve done demonstrates what you can do if you are committed as a government local or national
7808489 valencia is a testament to how you should do it
7808490 i applaud the efforts of valencia theyve gone the right way about it theyve committed to putting in the infrastructure to getting the resources right
7808491 next year they just need to put in some more colour the harbour needs to be full of boats more signage and a bit more glitz but theyve got it the right way round
7808492 ill be absolutely amazed if we dont go to singapore and have the same experience next month this is what it takes
7808493 it requires government support and to me it is a textbook example of what you can do if you all point in the same direction and have the commitment
7808494 for me i cant understand the ridiculous squabble we are having in england over the issue of relatively small amount of money with regard to the funding of the olympic games
7808495 we should be proud weve got the olympic games and we should be pushing and reflecting in attitude the efforts of all the people who went there and surpassed everybodys expectation with regard to the medals our country have won
7808496 unfortunately we seem to be the worlds best at turning around and being unconstructively critical
7808497 i know stories will be written with my comments but i dont care
7808498 im no no 2 whoever you put me next to even michael schumacher

7808592 this is certainly good for the game in india but the proposed suggestion of the candidate retiring at least ten years ago to be a selector is debatable
7808593 if you look into the marketing aspect yes the ipl leads but there are other aspects other than marketing that need to be compared mind you they bcci are here from several decades whereas icl is just a year old
7808594 we are actively considering brand acquisitions abroad for which a blueprint has already been prepared

7808598 weve looked at hundreds of spreadsheets but given the vast capabilities of excel weve only scratched the surface of how people organize their data our rules are xml based to make them easier to update so this project can evolve over time and get even better

7808601 we like to go to nice places like claim jumpers chilis and applebees we dont want the fly by night business the amigo store which they use to attract latinos like myself
7808602 i was born in mexico and raised in this country i agree we need some change but what they want to bring here is totally unrealistic applebee is good but a kabuki and also a trader joes come on i dont even go to trader joes
7808603 what i said was were striving to insure baldwin park doesnt look like tijuana
7808604 its like they want baldwin park in the style of capistrano or like hacienda heights
7808605 the restaurant industry is pretty hard to make it in eight years and im barely hanging on its like the city wants to make it hard for you
7808606 i love to go to traditional mexican restaurants i shop at vallarta supermarket but i cant get everything i need
7808607 at the end of the day its all mexican restaurants here when we want italian when we want sushi where do we go if i want a pair of kenneth coles i have to go to arcadia
7808608 the difference now is that corporate america has realized theres tremendous buying power in these communities
7808609 you had some mainstream stores who really took a risk for the first time really going into a predominantly spanish speaking area
7808610 after that you really saw ross marshall applebees chilis and a lot of those businesses in latino areas
7808611 before when the council was more mixed we could get along with them now that theyre all hispanics we have more trouble getting things they want the upscale something more anglo
7808612 i have nothing against 50 quincea era shops but i dont shop there many of my friends dont shop there

7808616 the boxers have done us all proud themselves the sport and their coaches
7808617 the high performance unit has made a big difference but you must realise that none of this success would be possible without the work at grass roots without the work of the club coaches who have worked with their lads since they were 11
7808618 we have a lot of talent in our ranks now weve got eight lads going to the world junior championships in mexico in october and come london i want us to have a representative in every weight division
7808619 i believe that is possible and that has to be our aim we have to keep working hard and looking to get even better weve proved we can compete with the best in the world
7808620 based on this analysis we can say that there is a 94 percent probability of imminent global cooling and the beginning of the coming ice age
7808621 most of these major natural processes that we are witnessing now are interdependent and occur at the end of each interglacial period ultimately causing sudden long term cooling
7808622 stock up on fur coats and felt boots earth is now at the peak of one of its passing warm spells it started in the 17th century when there was no industrial influence on the climate to speak of and no such thing as the hothouse effect
7808623 carbon dioxide is not to blame for global climate change sorokhtin said
7808624 solar activity is many times more powerful than the energy produced by the whole of humankind mans influence on nature is a drop in the ocean
7808625 if we are facing a crisis at all i think it is that we are preparing for warming when it is looking like we are cooling we are preparing for the wrong thing
7808626 there is no evidence that carbon dioxide has ever driven or will ever drive world temperatures and climate change worrying about carbon dioxide is irrelevant
7808627 graphic data has confirmed to us that one of their machines appears to have been inappropriately sold via a third party

7808629 clearly such details should never have been included in the hard drive of the computer offered for sale on ebay we will of course work with graphic data to establish how it came to be available for sale on our site

7808702 the road was blocked by felling three huge trees when my vehicle was passing through dense forest areas on kalingas ghat road the obstruction was obviously part of a plot to attack me
7808703 though the accompanying security men removed two trees the third one was too big for them to clear
7808704 i appreciate the role of police and security personnel in dealing with the situation
7808705 its ironic that just as regulators are breaking up one monopoly baa british airways and american airlines are trying to create another our results prove that consumers want choice on transatlantic routes

7808712 at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
7808713 i think the timing of the hu jintao visit to south korea was very depressing to the north koreans
7808714 i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the u s to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
7808715 such action by north korea will surely hurt foreign investor sentiment towards south korean shares even further i expect foreign exchange markets in particular to be vulnerable to the news

7808750 the best thing about the performance against queensland was that their scoreline was zero
7808751 our big focus was our defence and even when the game was won we still didnt let up
7808752 we have still got to get on top of penalties and i still was unhappy with us against the reds what makes me really really angry is when the referee tells us things like hands off or roll away and we dont and our missed tackles
7808753 we had 22 missed tackles against bath and although that was down against the reds our goal is to bring it down to 12 and then under 10
7808754 our line out is not there yet either we lost three in a row in the second half against the reds but then at least defended well off them
7808755 last year we would lose the line out miss three tackles and then give away the penalty so at least we are doing that multiple error
7808756 i have spoken to mikey ruddock who i know very well we played together and then obviously worked together at leinster and then coached against each other at international level
7808757 this game is his big trial they have played a couple of english division one clubs so they will be coming across brimming we will have to get back at it

7808787 while it was hugely satisfying to have been involved in that great win over dublin in particular i dont think anyone would be in the slightest bit complacent about their ongoing role within the team our manager mickey harte has shown that he has resources on the bench and that several players are very versatile
7808788 wexford will have gained in confidence they have now beaten both down and armagh and they have well and truly got that hammering by dublin in the leinster final out of their system we know they will be a big challenge for us
7808789 i was out of the team for a good while and to be honest there were times when i did not think i would get back in but its great to be involved again

7808959 sagte der schlussmann des fc valencia in einem interview mit dem sport informations dienst sid
7808960 sonne und meer satt zum leben muss valencia eine sehr angenehme stadt sein oder
7808961 auf jeden fall man hat den strand und das wasser direkt vor der haust r die stadt hat sich in den letzten jahren total entwickelt und auch viele sehensw rdigkeiten zu bieten man kann es sich gut gehen lassen
7808962 sie haben den schritt nach valencia zu gehen also nicht bereut zumindest was das leben angeht
7808963 ihre erste saison war zu beginn schwierig durch den zweikampf mit publikumsliebling santiago canizares oder
7808964 viele sagen es ist ein traum mal im ausland zu spielen und es war auch mein gro er wunsch neue erfahrungen zu machen ich habe diesen schritt gesucht und werde immer wieder gefragt ob ich es bereut habe aber das ist auf keinen fall so es war ein schwieriges jahr es ist sowieso schon schwer wenn man ins ausland geht aber es gab noch weitere schwierigkeiten mit denen ich zu k mpfen hatte ich habe das aber ganz gut bewerkstelligt
7808965 was sind die punkte an die man sich bei einem wechsel ins ausland erst gew hnen muss
7808966 auf jeden fall erstmal die sprache am anfang versteht man berhaupt nichts man kann nicht teilnehmen am mannschaftsgef ge kann sich nicht einbringen muss aber trotzdem seine leistung bringen das geht auch spielern so die innerhalb der bundesliga wechseln vor allem ausl ndern das braucht einige zeit
7808967 wie sehen die ambitionen des fc valencia f r die neue saison aus nachdem man in der vorigen spielzeit zwar pokalsieger geworden ist aber nur knapp den klassenerhalt geschafft hat
7808968 ich glaube dass die letzte saison f r diesen klub eine absolute ausnahme war was da alles gelaufen ist das auf und ab und das ganze theater im klub mit verschiedenen trainern und einem pr sidentenwechsel jetzt haben wir einen super trainer die mannschaft ist zusammengeblieben unsere stars sind noch an bord deshalb denke ich dass alles richtig gut werden wird wir wollen schon wieder oben angreifen
7808969 der supercup ging durch das 2 4 im r ckspiel am sonntag aber an meister real madrid der lange zeit in unterzahl spielen musste
7808970 das war verr ckt ein kurioses spiel gegen neun mann zu verlieren das darf einer mannschaft wie uns nicht passieren
7808971 wie weit ist der bau des neuen stadions wann wird es fertig
7808972 zur n chsten saison das wird wohl ein richtiger fu ball tempel
7808973 gut alle sind stolz dass spanien den titel gewonnen hat
7808974 das thema nationalmannschaft haben sie trotz der ausbootung vor der em noch nicht abgeschlossen die nummer eins zu werden war immer ihr ziel ist das noch der fall
7808975 ich habe viel erlebt in der letzten saison das angek ndigte gespr ch mit joachim l w steht noch aus warten wir mal ab
7808976 aber von ihrer seite ist es so wenn man eine grundlage finden w rde w ren sie froh wieder dabei zu sein oder
7808977 die nummer eins in der nationalmannschaft war immer mein ziel und bleibt es auch so lange ich die m glichkeit habe und mir die t r nicht zugemacht wird hoffe ich und glaube ich dar an
7808978 vieles ich habe in zwei jahren zwei titel geholt das spricht f r mich
7808979 bundestorwarttrainer andreas k pke hat den verzicht auf ihre nachnominierung f r das l nderspiel in der vorigen woche gegen belgien damit erkl rt dass es noch dinge g be die ausger umt werden m ssten k nnen sie sich vorstellen was er damit meint
7808980 ich werde es schon noch gesagt bekommen die europameisterschaft ist nun zwei monate her mir wurde angek ndigt dass ein gespr ch stattfindet wahrscheinlich wird das in der n chsten zeit auch passieren ich wei nicht wann nat rlich h tte ich mir gew nscht dass es direkt im anschluss an die em passiert einfach um klarheit zu haben warum es nicht mehr gereicht hat und ich nicht nominiert wurde einfach um damit abzuschlie en oder etwas ndern zu k nnen aber jetzt ist es so wie es ist
7808981 wie schwierig war es die europameisterschaft vor dem fernseher zu verfolgen
7808982 ich habe mir das finale angeschaut vom halbfinale ein bisschen mitbekommen ansonsten war urlaub angesagt in irland bei einer hochzeit und in amerika
7808983 dazu haben ja schon viele ihren kommentar abgegeben spanien war die beste mannschaft bei dieser europameisterschaft und hat verdient gewonnen
7808984 wenn man seinen arbeitsplatz in valencia hat mit sonne und meer ist es dann vorstellbar irgendwann vielleicht wieder zur ck in die bundesliga zu kommen

7808997 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7808999 on saturday we were buzzing and really pleased by the result but football can bring you right back down to earth if we dont do the business against rotherham
7809000 what i find in football is that youve got to try to keep yourself on an even keel all the time because otherwise you get kicked in the teeth
7809001 we enjoyed saturdays win but we started preparing for rotherham on sunday because theres a fine line between success and failure in football
7809002 it feels like were riding the crest of a wave at the moment so we want to go to rotherham and win to keep that going we dont want to do anything for that to stop
7809003 the carling cup is important for us as well because it gives more players the opportunity to play and if they impress they can keep the shirt
7809004 winning just like losing is a habit people wonder why teams at the bottom cant seem to buy a win and its all about confidence
7809005 its the same with winning once you start winning you dont want to stop and weve done that even from coming from behind
7809006 on saturday we managed to get ahead and keep it that way so we dont want to change that and well be looking to keep that going over the next two games
7809007 i played against accrington a couple of weeks ago so hopefully ill get a start tonight more than anything just to get 90 minutes to keep my fitness levels up
7809008 i suppose its a nice problem for the manager to have because he didnt really have it last season to the extent hes got it this time and that can only benefit the team of course the lads are going to be disappointed at not playing but the ones not picked get behind everyone and it showed on saturday
7809009 we look full of goals the wingers jarvo and kights chris iwelumo and sylvan ebanks blake all look dangerous and look like scoring goals as do andy keogh and sam vokes
7809010 its great to be in a team like that whereas last season we were trying to nick a goal and then trying to hold on this season we look very strong
7809011 which was a bit special for me as a boyhood owls fan
7809012 i want every game to be a cup final for us and our lads are playing with a little skip in their step these days
7809013 we know it will be tough so we need to be on our game
7809014 wolves have made a good start and they have millions of pounds worth of players at their disposal so we are just hoping that they might rest one or two

7809016 it is a wrong perception that the announcement on the rurs has been delayed due to pressure of the trade unions but that is not the only reason it is also because a section of the large and medium industry particularly the electronics sector are opposed to some of the guidelines for the naming of the raksha utpadan ratnas

7809078 i think its easier said than done especially if youve had a bad game or you lost
7809079 when that happens you find yourself sitting around thinking about the plays you could have made thats why its important that by this point youve learned to have a short memory
7809080 its a chance to get your heart and your head at 100 percent
7809081 then there was more than a couple where he splattered just a little bit
7809082 you can go out and hit somebody but if you dont hit them the right way and have good leverage
7809083 this is my first week practicing there itd be like looking at the team after a week of training camp you dont expect the team to be perfect at that point but you expect them to be making improvement toward what you want them to be
7809084 i dont feel completely comfortable but im getting more comfortable every day i feel like im making real improvement every day
7809085 im going to do everything you ask me to do go as hard as i possibly can but the fact is its not going to be perfect right now theres still things i need to work on
7809086 jason is a pretty good fullback there i think he has some skill and ability and then tony is progressing and he has to do that very quickly here and then jed has had a fine training camp as well and had a couple of shots there early well certainly go back and review that as well
7809087 it is important to chris well have to see day by day i dont know how hard he can go but he needs to get out there and he needs to practice
7809088 im not going to get into numbers and how many were going to keep and all that
7809089 its probably one of the things were going to have to decide after the game no question
7809090 the flanker spot is built for a guy like him as far as the basic routes and adjustments
7809091 it fits his skills a little better than x the x is in many cases a little bit bigger stronger type
7809092 he had a good game the other night and hes had a great camp hes got such great quickness and good football sense and he loves to play hes a high motor guy
7809093 hes the boss im not going to call him out on it
7809094 it really wasnt that big of a deal putting it back on wasnt a problem it was the chicken and the salads when i was taking it off that were hard
7809095 im not going to say he didnt surprise me some
7809096 i think hes surprised a lot of people weve seen before he has played some linebacker some tackle some fullback right now hes one of those four tackles
7809097 i think hes right on schedule or maybe even a little bit ahead of schedule im glad hes going to be back this year
7809098 how many guys do we keep mcdougle had had a good preseason i think everybody knows that
7809099 its hard not to look feminine am i right or am i wrong
7809100 but would i do it yeah id do it i dont know how far id get i might look like jerry springer did when he was on
7809101 i think a lot of the guys would do it but probably none of us would be good
7809102 i think maybe donovan mcnabb and omar gaither might do it i think outgoing guys like them might do it but me no no way first of all i cant dance like that maybe i could learn but i just have better things to do with my time than play around with ballroom dancing
7809103 i mean its something thatll bring you a lot of publicity but i dont want that im just a low key type guy who does what i do and moves along
7809104 but you dont hear them saying theyd like to be on the show
7809105 mainly because there are usually professional athletes who are part of the show jerry rice emmitt smith people like that
7809106 but no way i would do it its just not something id want to learn i mean after being on that show where would i go to dance like that even if i learned
7809107 and i dont think id want to spend my off season learning how to ballroom dance when i could be doing something i really enjoy like being on the lake with my boat
7809108 maybe the ballroom dancing i could do but the other stuff sometimes looks too feminine to me
7809109 youve got to do that to pull it off you know what i mean
7809110 even smith rice and taylor had to do things that looked a little bit feminine to pull it off and thats just not for me there are probably a handful of dudes on the eagles who would go on the show but not this cat here
7809111 this was quite obviously a pre planned theft which must have taken quite some time to carry out
7809112 the suspects knew what they were after and have forced the gates to the yard open and managed to steal the truck before staff returned to work on the friday morning
7809113 afghanistan has historically suffered from decades of conflict and is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world
7809114 it also stops afghan farmers going about their daily work
7809115 10 6m is a very significant investment which we believe will continue the real progress weve seen
7809116 thanks to the halo trust and others we have halved the number of mine victims in just the last five years in afghanistan
7809117 this major new announcement im making today will i believe be a significant contribution to continuing that progress
7809118 out in the west is an area which has had very little work done over the last 20 years
7809119 the halo trust has mainly been based in the north of the country and around kabul
7809120 eles n o quiseram aprovar a presta o de contas disseram que havia dinheiro para consumo outro para bens permanentes
7809121 j estamos tendo preju zo cortando rvores de tr s anos que levariam sete para atingir o ponto ideal agora fomos surpreendidos pela suspens o dos trabalhos porque os ndios disseram que n o pod amos continuar l n o queremos criar conflito e sa mos da rea
7809122 donovan and l j s were both more extensive and a lot more damage was going on down there so i wouldnt expect to take as long to get back as they took
7809123 definitely said it was smart that we went in there and did it
7809124 he was able to fix what was going on down there and hes pretty optimistic i should have a speedy recovery
7809125 i dont think theres too much of a timetable right now
7809126 right now im just walking im increasing it about a quarter mile each day from what i understand thats all ill be doing for the next week or so down the road ill start jogging and stretching
7809127 i definitely dont want to come back too early and put myself out for more of the season
7809128 i dont have a game in sight but i want to get back out as soon as possible
7809129 you have to be in tune with your body i guess ive never had this injury ill work with the trainers but ultimately its my body and when im ready hopefully ill feel good out there
7809130 i know i started feeling it about three or four days into training camp this year it started giving me problems and it gradually became harder and harder to get through practice i definitely continued to aggravate it and tweak it more
7809131 then there was more than a couple where he splattered just a little bit so the fundamental and technique work there will come into play
7809132 theres a battle there now jason davis is a pretty good fullback there i think he has some skill and ability
7809133 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7809134 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7809135 fortunately i dont think im going to miss too much of the season
7809136 i dont know what exactly the procedure was but they had to go in both sides and fix them
7809137 he told me not to compare this to other injuries because theyre completely different
7809138 both donovan and l j s were a lot more extensive and had a lot more damage i wouldnt expect it to take as long as they took to get back
7809139 but i figured id have the surgery now and get back as soon as possible they havent given me a timetable its kind of see how it feels as you go as time passes well have a better idea when ill be back out there
7809140 i know ive had issues down there since my days in st louis
7809141 its gotten worse over the years i know i started feeling it in training camp about 3 or 4 days into it it started giving me problems and it gradually became harder and harder to get through practice with it after the carolina game it got to a point where it was hard to deal with
7809142 football players youre going to have to play through some pain sometimes
7809143 i underestimated it a little bit i just figured it was one of those things you played through and eventually it got better but it didnt
7809144 i definitely dont want to come back too early and put myself out for more of the season
7809145 im going to be back out there when i know i cant do more damage to it you dont want to lose more time you want to make sure its right i dont know what the magic formula is but ill know when im ready
7809146 when somebody gets hurt we go with the next guy who steps up and plays
7809147 thats just our mentality wed like to have kevin back as quick as possible hes a really good player i think hes a little underrated and hes a good player wed like him back as quick as we can in the meantime we have some pretty good players that will be able to step up and play at a high level
7809148 everyday we would see gunmen riding their cars and we were afraid they might shoot us
7809149 we come here to have fun and forget about that
7809150 i have nightmares sometimes and i have shortness of breath
7809151 i often feel panic i am always expecting that someone will attack our house at any moment
7809152 we try to ease their pains even if we manage to ease a small portion of their sadness it is something
7809153 the iraqi children have been kept from public parks and outdoor spaces
7809154 families have not taken them out because they are afraid they have been deprived of theater the movies football everything im trying to make this place fun for them
7809155 i have tried here in all possible ways to ban depictions of guns or tanks
7809156 i do not allow children to bring toys in the shape of weapons i am trying to stop terrorism from infiltrating our children if they play with those toys now they could use them for real when they grow up
7809157 this is a tree this is the sun this is a house and a man
7809158 i want them to draw from their imagination they can choose the subject that they want and the material too
7809159 i draw that question mark in order to ask why why are my friends getting killed
7809160 this is a play but its also reality because there are children playing on the streets and car bombs do kill them we have not enjoyed our childhood we stay at home and watch cartoons
7809161 ma maaf ada masalah penting yang ingin saya bicarakan denganmu oleh karena itu saya memanggil kamu ke sini
7809162 i send greetings to all americans on independence day more than two centuries ago bold and courageous visionaries pledged their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor in signing the declaration of independence guided by ancient and eternal truths our forefathers proclaimed to the world that liberty was the natural right of all mankind and in doing so began one of the greatest chapters in human history on the fourth of july our country commemorates the great achievements of these heroes and reaffirms its unwavering confidence in the power of freedom it was the desire for freedom that inspired our founding fathers and it is the belief in the universality of freedom that guides our nation on this occasion we pay special tribute to the men and women of our armed forces both past and present who have answered freedoms call and defended the values that make america the greatest country on earth may god bless america
7809163 its estimated that in the united states produce travels an average of 1 500 miles from farms to the homes of consumers so it just provides us an opportunity to make products closer to home and buy local
7809164 the quality i have i dont do any markets like that just because my stuff is picked ripe and the only shelf i want it on is between here and the customer at home
7809165 and sitting in any retail store is just not good for my produce
7809166 if people decide theyre going to consume locally that means theyre probably not consuming our walnuts and apricots and almonds and everything else we grow around here
7809167 we know which employee took the server and sold it but we believe it was an honest mistake and it was not intentional to sell it without the server being cleared
7809168 this is a very unfortunate incident and we are taking measures to ensure it will never happen again
7809169 graphic data has confirmed to us that one of their machines appears to have been inappropriately sold on via a third party
7809170 as a result historical data relating to credit card applications from some of our customers and data from other banks were not removed
7809171 we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency

7809173 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
7809174 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7809175 here is what the catechism of the catholic church says human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception

7809180 ive had a great last year and i really mean this
7809181 i was not a part of that presidential search i sat through it all but i dont want anyone to think i had a bad year i had a great year and it was one of the best years the college has had
7809182 its like a new change in my life of course for 45 years in a row ive been on college campus welcoming students teaching students or doing something as a faculty member or administrator this will be the first time in 45 years that i wont be doing that so thats a change
7809183 weve tried to expand the reaches of monroe community college throughout our community everyone should have the opportunity to go to college if they want to and i think weve made that possible
7809184 ive known the way hes impacted students in their growth choices in careers and personal choices
7809185 its remarkable when he works with students its so clear how much he cares about them and their success
7809186 his leadership has helped to elevate mccs stature as a premier institution and a national model emulated by schools throughout the country
7809187 toms dedication and perseverance made him an invaluable asset to the college his outstanding character and professionalism have made him a pleasure to work with over the years he will be missed
7809188 hes one of the very accomplished community college administrators in the country and were in great hands
7809189 he said to me as you look back can you say what dad said

7809197 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7809198 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7809199 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7809200 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7809201 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

7809223 every time the government has lost data ministers have promised a crackdown but nothing has happened and a culture of complacency remains
7809224 it is time to send a clear and unambiguous signal to officials and agents who are entrusted with private data that it is no longer acceptable to take risks over how it is handled civil penalties will not do the regrettable conclusion is that only the threat of a criminal sanction will change mindsets and jolt this government to ensure proper precautions in future
7809225 this was data being held in a secure form but was downloaded on to a memory stick by an external contractor
7809226 it runs against the rules set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor

7809230 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7809231 you know when we were flying and i was worried we might hit something in the storm and you said the only thing we could possibly hit at this height was a cloud stuffed with rocks
7809232 they are both going to do what they have to do
7809233 there is a lot obama could have done to unify the party and basically he hasnt lifted a finger
7809234 feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments
7809235 and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process sen obama would go a long way towards healing these wounds if he were to specifically praise the accomplishments of the clinton presidency in a line or two during his speech on thursday
7809236 yes theres some scabs but sometimes underneath a scab theres a little bit of pus but we have to put some disinfectant on it so we that can heal the wound and move forward thats what the convention is about
7809237 there is a group of hillary people who are very angry very upset
7809238 some of its directed at the media very disappointed you cant control all those people these are ceos some of them major rich people
7809239 you cant call them and tell them what to do there is no question there is that category of people but i dont think people can blame her for their behavior i think thats probably unfair
7809240 her challenge is to make the most of the emotion without popping the roof off
7809241 she wants to reassert her relevance and introduce a new political identity
7809242 i think she understands that if she runs again she has to run a different style of campaign
7809243 and shes got a huge opening right now for the first time in her career she actually has a base to invigorate at the beginning of the 08 campaign she was the issue she had to explain herself her celebrity now shes got a base the working class and she needs to speak to them
7809244 hillary is very goal oriented and so the goal shifted from ive got to win to baracks got to win
7809245 with bill clinton the transition was harder because he wasnt the candidate its difficult when the candidate and the target of obamas primary campaign is his wife

7809262 opto circuits is a company which designs and manufactures medical equipments like cardiac stands fluid warmers cholesterol monitors etc the company had come out with attractive results for the june quarter with its revenues growing impressively by around 84 to rs 177 crore and net profit growing by 62 to rs 45 crore
7809263 the companys subsidiary opto infrastructure has recently have been given by the government an approval to set up an sez in mysore over around 150 acres of land this company is likely to report a cagr of 57 for revenues and 45 of net profits for the next two years and is expected to report and eps of rs 20 for fy09 which means its quoting at 17 times fy09 earnings my target for this stock would be rs 500 in about a years time
7809264 the dollar is going to be the main trading input until we have a more definite path on gustav
7809265 energy markets have not yet focused on what this latest escalation could mean for a potential disruption in energy supplies
7809266 until we get better clarity on this latter issue we expect the price reverberations from this situation to be relatively contained
7809267 the path to get to the point im at now was a really interesting one
7809268 everything i did was leading up to it whether i realized it or not and mostly not it was going towards where im at now
7809269 i did commercial art for some time but i always needed to pretty much make ends meet with other stuff thats when i got into landscaping
7809270 by the time i had finished that wall there was a realization theres something going on here the touch the feel whatever a real connection so i took that and ran with it
7809271 i knew stone was where i wanted to go i got serious about it
7809272 when i do the stone work its as much art as anything i do the way i approach stonework is how shapes fit together and how light affects textures and how sunlight will take a different course during the day and highlight stones or a stone wall
7809273 working in all that 3 d a little light bulb went on id been interested in sculpture but id never done it
7809274 its really crazy i didnt think of it till then
7809275 oh ha this is what i should have been doing all along literally i just dove into it it was amazing
7809276 then he took classes with kate aichele and me it was astonishing the innate talent he had bottled up that was allowed to flow it was just truly astonishing very early on i was quite jealous of how talented he was
7809277 but that admitted im truly happy for him steve is doing so extremely well he does wonderful images that really touch people
7809278 ive always been interested in the human figure ive done a bit of athletics in my day used the body in my stone work i know how it works and that gives me an edge
7809279 after doing physical work over the past 12 years i have a sense of what the body goes though in its motions and such
7809280 when you look at a piece i would like you to look at more than an object something more there to be said
7809281 i wont give it up i do love it that much but ill be selective
7809282 be sure to define the module instance outside of a function so that it is not in the functions local scope otherwise the object might be garbage collected and the associated event listeners might never be invoked

7809284 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong stand alone value proposition for shareholders
7809285 the driver of demand for our products is urbanisation and industrialisation in heavily populated countries like china and india and these economies continue to grow strongly
7809286 the only black spot was that copper earnings were down slightly after they had some mining issues during the year
7809287 subdued economic prospects and the expectation of additional price hikes continued to depress consumer sentiment
7809288 the german economy is encountering an increasingly more difficult situation
7809289 are markedly more sceptical with regard to the six month outlook
7809290 as slightly positive and the outlook is assessed less critically
7809291 one thing has become crystal clear the german consumer is no match for the rapid slowdown of the global economy

7809304 with a soup on of courage and a dash of self discipline one can make a small talent go a long way
7809305 why are we being asked to debate this bill first we have not had time to read and prepare for the debate the time given is too short
7809306 the dialogue has not been completed it is arrogant and reckless for anybody to come and address parliament mugabe is not mandated by anyone to address parliament nobody has the right to address parliament before talks are completed
7809307 we are also in a difficult position because our national chairman lovemore moyo is now the speaker and we have to decide how to proceed
7809308 there is no way that a country of 63 million like thailand will let a group of five people form a street gang to seize control
7809309 i wont yield my cabinet wont yield the military and the police wont yield
7809310 i wont leave until there is a political change if you want me to leave you will have to kill me and take my body out of here
7809311 we need to have greater clarity that this government is going to be around next year

7809320 wir nehmen das sehr ernst und bem hen uns mit graphic data dringend gegen diesen bedauerlichen datenverlust vorzugehen
7809321 here is a man who has everything royalty fame fortune adoration yet he is worried about losing his hair
7809322 only 216 000 filipino men with mphl out of a massive 5 4 million sought treatment options with ultimately 21 000 receiving medical treatment it is an alarming statistic considering that mphl is a progressive condition making its sufferer lose 5 of hair each year if it isnt correctly diagnosed and properly managed
7809323 its more of improvement and stabilization of the hair loss
7809324 would you be able to restore it completely no hair recovery reaches a plateau which means that after about two years of undergoing treatment whatever hair youve gained since you just have to maintain it if you stop the treatment then the hair goes too
7809325 with finasteride its roughly 60 to 65 percent but stabilization of hair loss would be about 70 to 90 percent
7809326 it doesnt go very long just about a half an inch to an inch then it stops growing
7809327 if youre meant to lose hair at 30 if you use both minoxidil and propecia then youre probably going to start losing hair at 35
7809328 but that means you have to keep using those products for the rest of your life and its a very expensive thing to do
7809329 there are hair piece but its life span is just two to three years youd have to get a new one again plus its just a hair piece when you take it off you know youre still bald underneath
7809330 the only problem with hair transplants is knowing when to start
7809331 because if for example youre 28 and youre only balding in front i can put hair in there but when you grow older and you start losing hair in other parts youd have to come back and have those done as well its easier if a patient has completely lost his hair in front and at the top because i will only have to do the procedure in one go instead of doing one part initially then doing the progressively balding parts years later
7809332 not to stimulate transplanted hairs but to stimulate susceptible originally miniaturizing hairs and also to somehow hold down the progression of their thinning
7809333 average cost per procedure would be p150 000 to p180 000 but we can sometimes offer discounts to help patients
7809334 ive had a patient who is a taxi driver who was very depressed but he spends p2 000 a month on hair products to stop his balding youd be surprised at what people would to try to hold off their balding i told him to save his money for two years and come back to me and well see what can be done

7809374 for me you have to take into consideration how long a driver has been in formula 1 when you evaluate his performance
7809375 for no other reason that puts lewis top of the heap he is the best in formula 1 at the moment
7809376 if you take into account how little experience he has had thats the bit that gives him the edge
7809377 it doesnt mean to say he is particularly quicker than the others or he has dominated its just you have to take how long they have been involved in the sport as one of the values
7809378 how can you criticise him only a fool doesnt realise that irrespective of age you learn something every day
7809379 it is no different for a racing driver because they spend their whole life driving a racing car and they are going to learn more and more

7809544 kledingadvies is echt een hype geworden door alle media aandacht
7809545 verklaard vanuit de huidige kledingstijl is dat ook helemaal niet gek de kledingcodes zijn losser geworden kijk maar naar wouter bos die zonder stropdas verschijnt tien jaar geleden hadden mensen de zekerheid dat ze gewoon strak in pak naar hun werk moesten gaan nu is er meer vrijheid waardoor veel mensen in de war raken over hoe ze zich moeten kleden
7809546 het is veel meer geaccepteerd om er als man ook verzorgd uit te zien
7809547 ik kon wel wat advies gebruiken ik kocht maar wat
7809548 het fijne van een kledingadviseur is dat die weet waar alle goede winkels zitten ik vond het een martelgang om de kalverstraat af te gaan op zoek naar de juiste kleding
7809549 ze denken veel na over het product en het merk dat ze proberen neer te zetten maar lopen erg achter wat betreft kleding terwijl je daarmee ook je merk neer kunt zetten
7809550 het totale plaatje dat klanten zien moet kloppen je zet jezelf neer met de idee n die je presenteert maar ook met de manier waarop je jezelf presenteert als het plaatje niet klopt wringt het en vragen klanten zich af waar wringt het nog meer
7809551 bij ons is het doe maar wat je zelf wilt ik draag bijvoorbeeld graag slippers op het werk klanten verwachten ook dat wij losjes gekleed gaan omdat dat onze stijl is
7809552 veel mensen die een pak dragen denken daar helemaal niet bij na het is een gegeven voor ze ze vragen zich vaak niet eens af of het een goed pak is of niet we zijn n van de slechtst geklede landen van europa na duitsland de stijl van nederland is miss etam

7809562 im going to the convention because i want to see hillary
7809563 i want to be inspired by her encouraged by her to do whats going to be the best thing for all of our futures shes trying to help us all get through this
7809564 i dont think that senator obama understands how deep this commitment goes to hillary and where this passion comes from
7809565 im also a very very devoted democrat so this is a very hard situation john mccain is unacceptable
7809566 hillary supporters should take their cues from her and follow her lead
7809567 will probably throw in a reference to him in her speech
7809568 its unfortunate as we circle together if we shoot ourselves

7809577 massage alone does tend to be the recommended course of action for general relaxation certain soft tissue disorders and if the patient simply prefers a massage over an adjustment

7809602 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7809603 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7809604 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7809605 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7809606 the points she talked about her family and daughters were almost a tear jerker at times when she talked about her fathers ms and how he worked and kept the family together it was emotional i felt
7809607 she talked about things that very few people talk about the homeless the hungry she made it real i think her speech touched the hearts of all americans
7809608 i liked it when they brought in the kids and had a mini teleconference with barack
7809609 it showed how close they are as a family it showed the love in that family and the support barack will get from his family when he is president
7809610 the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7809611 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7809612 at this point i would definitely consider coming back with a 25 cent increase for paratransit
7809613 we have a fiduciary responsibility to not threaten the survival of the service itself
7809614 but we also have to realize we provide a necessary service so theres a balance as to whats a reasonable deficit and what we inherited five or six years ago

7809619 diviene una stupefacente chiave di lettura per un eloquente ciclo di grandi tele capaci di rinnovare con sensibile e moderna spiritualit il significato della vita e del verbo di dio
7809620 nelle altre grandi tele ad olio che compongono questa energica suite realizzata da pelliccione tra il 2007 ed il 2008 ritroviamo alla guida della sua immaginazione la stessa efficacia il medesimo principio etico utilizzato per il grande trittico apparizione di cristo risorto accompagnato come sempre dalla forte esperienza della pratica pittorica verso il battesimo tentazioni discorso della montagna orto degli ulivi deposizione discesa agli inferi raccolta degli apostoli trasfigurazione apparizione agli apostoli sono opere che ci conducono dentro un mondo che certamente rivela con chiarezza tutti i tratti formali e gli impianti cromatici che connotano il lessico proprio dellartista e la sua spiccata riconoscibilit determinando uno stato meditativo sulla natura spirituale di quei fatti che hanno accompagnato la vita pubblica di ges la sua sofferenza la vicinanza agli apostoli il senso di forte sospensione atmosferica che lartista ci offre si compenetra al sentimento di totale assolutezza dello spazio astratto e metafisico ad un tempo le iconografie di pelliccione sanno dimostrarsi esperienza estetica autentica ed assumere il ruolo profondo e complesso della consapevolezza traduzione pittorica intenzionalmente passata attraverso lispirazione della parola di dio

7809624 reforms based on transparency can foster accountability and build confidence in medical education and in turn the practice of medicine
7809625 at this point i would definitely consider coming back with a 25 cent increase for paratransit
7809626 we have a fiduciary responsibility to not threaten the survival of the service itself
7809627 but we also have to realize we provide a necessary service so theres a balance as to whats a reasonable deficit and what we inherited five or six years ago

7809673 one of the greatest experiences we could give them was a trip to the olympic village with 16 500 living in there and a dining area that seats 5 000 it can be fairly daunting for a lot of young athletes
7809674 i remember what it was like for my first olympics i was completely terrified and quite overwhelmed
7809675 luckily i did ok in atlanta but if i can impart some of my knowledge or offer any advice to these young athletes then i think its a job well done
7809676 you need to almost demystify the olympics you need to treat it as just another competition these guys are good enough there are some athletes here on the programme who were painfully close to making the team
7809677 if you can allow them to see what its like so they are not completely blown away by the experience then hopefully theyll be the best prepared athletes going into the london games
7809678 getting the chance to come here and experience the atmosphere was amazing
7809679 i was looking at the track and thinking what it would be like to be down there with all those people in the stands looking at me i tried to imagine what it would it be like if they were all there to see me
7809680 i think the best thing about coming here is that ive now seen for myself that the olympics are just another tournament
7809681 despite sitting in the rain for two hours at thursdays open water race i wouldnt have wanted to be anywhere else
7809682 it was brilliant to watch the best athletes in the world and it just filled me with a load of emotions that i want to be there next time

7809708 its going to be very interesting indeed where the credibility stakes now hang in this place in terms of those opposite and their behaviour in the senate as they begin to launch their assault on this nations best fiscal preparedness for what will be uncertain global economic times ahead
7809709 they certainly dont have a mandate for these completely unjustifiable tax increases
7809710 what the government is actually doing is taxing australians now in an unjustifiable way in order to spend it later in order to buy their way back into office in 2010

7809716 the supreme court does have physical and legal jurisdiction and we cannot force it to allow trillanes to attend sessions what we are saying is that the court cannot set aside the election of trillanes as senator
7809717 kung sa majority si trillanes he can vote on senate measures because the session can be brought to his detention facility
7809718 but the reality is he belongs to the minority and his vote should not count
7809719 while we recognize that the courts have jurisdiction over trillanes insofar as the pending cases against trillanes are concerned we will likewise assert that we too have jurisdiction over this person being a member of the senate

7809729 it will not only be the bradman museum but it will be the international cricket hall of fame whose captain will be don bradman and the team will be obviously the best
7809730 the initial team of 12 people will be from all over the world i dont know exactly who they will be but they will include people like sachin tendulkar from india
7809731 as the hall of the fame is implemented we will be setting up to embrace the other cricket nations like india and pakistan
7809732 he gave australia pride and hope at a time when through the depression and wwii we really needed it
7809733 we had a tiny population then and the fact that he could go out and be the worlds best gave a lot of hope to australia
7809734 i think its one of the reasons why australia does so well in sport now we can approach any sport and challenge the worlds best we dont feel diffident we dont feel that we cant win at any sport that we do
7809735 the wonderful values that cricket has and how it helps society helps young people learn fairness and competition

7809774 my administration shall continue to give the judiciary the necessary supports it needs to continue to function in an independent impartial and courageous manner
7809775 our history as a nation bears out the fact that given the socio cultural religious and ethnic diversities of our people federalism was considered the most effective option
7809776 it accommodates these differences in a manner that would promote the unity and prosperity of our dear country
7809777 the challenge before the present generation of political leaders and the citizenry is to imbibe the appropriate lessons from our constitutional and political history and use them as instruments to forge a federal structure that is unique to nigeria he added
7809778 the states and local governments must equally begin to articulate and implement programmes which add value to the economy
7809779 nigeria today has one of the most credible legal systems in the world characterised by a judiciary which has routinely demonstrated its capacity for independence as envisaged by the constitution
7809780 my administration shall continue to give the judiciary the necessary support it needs to continue to function in an independent impartial and courageous manner
7809781 aside from focusing on the rule of law i have discovered that many lawyers still behave lawlessly and the new team should urgently confront that

7809796 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july
7809797 it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
7809798 the pressures on household budgets are reflected in the relatively weak rise in individuals deposits and with consumer borrowing growing only slowly it seems that consumers are acting prudently

7809800 with the economy slowing and energy bills on the rise it is totally unacceptable that hard pressed businesses are left so open to exploitation by energy suppliers
7809801 ofgems investigation into the industry must hold the suppliers to account over the very apparent lack of transparency and fairness in their dealings with business
7809802 energywatch is currently providing a crucial service to thousands of businesses who are confused and frustrated by energy suppliers if a super consumer group is to be established as the government plans there is little doubt in my mind that this service will be all but lost leaving companies at the mercy of the suppliers an obvious solution would be establishing a separate watchdog dedicated to assisting businesses

7809814 they came to n c state werent highly recruited and their first year they were on the cover of sports illustrated they were doing something about freshmen who made an impact sports illustrated told me it came down to archie griffin or the buckey twins and they said they went with the buckey twins
7809815 he wasnt highly recruited and came to south carolina and what i learned from him is you can succeed if nobody believes in you you cant succeed if you dont believe in yourself he was absolutely right he wasnt fast he wasnt big he was 5 10 180 pounds but was mvp in the bowl game when we beat ohio state
7809816 the game that turned it around was probably the duke game when we were 1 2 1 we put on a great goal line stand
7809817 we had the second largest turnaround in the history of ncaa football from 0 11 in 1999 to 8 4 in 2000 that was a monumental win
7809818 when i was at n c state we had four little children n c state didnt pay you a whole lot so we didnt eat out a whole lot
7809819 two passes hit our defensive backs hands and bounced over his head and they caught them for touchdowns we just didnt play as well as i thought they could have or should have
7809820 we had a touchdown called back for offensive pass interference and then he clemsons rod gardner pushes off and catches it to set up the winning touchdown
7809821 the rain was unbelievable it was the most miserable ive ever seen i remember we played a very good defensive football game we moved the ball but we turned it over
7809822 the fans at n c state were really tremendous they sold the stadium out sat on that hill back there and were enthusiastic the fans at south carolina even when you lose there were 80 000 there theyre very good schools but theyre city schools also they have a campus but they have a city theres a lot to do its a great place to live there really are a lot more similarities than there are things that are dissimilar
7809823 they have great talent they have potentially four or five first round draft picks on defense

7809843 i know that now im going back to my club to discuss terms with them because this is my future
7809844 there are so many offers for me and i think its high time i leave ive played three seasons there and i think ive helped them
7809845 i wanted to leave them last season they begged me they said that i should stay so that i will come back to serie a and then i can leave
7809846 they gave me their word so they have to fulfil their promise
7809847 ive had a wonderful experience in italy its the style of play that i warm to
7809848 however some people tell me that i should go to england that im speedy that i have skills in front that i can beat any defender

7809851 as a revolutionary bhagat singh was known to sport a european hat the bust doesnt do justice to his persona during that historic period family members were not consulted on the statue
7809852 bhagat singh did not wear a turban for three years between 1928 till he was hanged on march 23 1931 and he did not have a beard
7809853 four real pictures were available to the government and were handed over to the parliamentary committee
7809854 the committee asked us to prepare a statue similar to one in hussainiwala where he was cremated in that bhagat singh does wear a turban
7809855 we recovered one body belonging to the crew of the missing aircraft

7809857 we have not found the aircraft body but we already know the general area where it crashed

7809859 ratifying the compact could allow great lakes water to no longer be held within the public trust and instead be defined as a product for commercial use
7809860 i want to thoroughly understand the lasting impact this compact could have on great lakes water for years to come it took the governors more than three years to get this done so it is not unreasonable for congress to take the time necessary to make sure we are not opening the door for the commercialization of great lakes water
7809861 the water protection standards in the compact make several desperately needed reforms in water law including water conservation environmental protection and integration of ground and surface water management im confident that these standards will be enforced because the compact specifically provides for citizen enforcement
7809862 its the 11th hour for the great lakes compact but lets be sure its not the 11th hour for the great lakes before the u s house acts on the compact this fall congress needs to take steps to assure the document doesnt expose this magnificent ecosystem to commercial exploitation
7809863 establishes a precedent that water can be grabbed by profit hungry corporations who want to claim it is a product not subject to the compact this undermines the very purpose of the compact and creates a dangerous precedent for exporting water in the u s in this instance from the largest body of freshwater in north america
7809864 the privatization of water is a deeply troubling concern here and around the world
7809865 all you need to do is grab a bottle of wisconsin beer or any other of the fantastic brews we have in the great lakes region to know that waters been put into bottles for more than a century
7809866 at the end of the day if youre buying bottled water well youre probably paying at least 10 times what it costs to filter water from your own tap thats likely even healthier for you anyway some say thats naive or evian spelled backwards
7809867 been too focused on arguments related to how the water is used when the real argument to be made to the rest of the world is that our ecosystem cant survive if the water doesnt stay here
7809868 the compact is rooted in conservation that focus should be front and center
7809869 contains major loopholes that could result in the privatization of great lakes waters for commercial sale
7809870 the argument that the compact would be at risk because it would take too long to change it through further negotiations isnt applicable because if congress imposes conditions the states are basically bound to such conditions its either now or never
7809871 although a majority of this infill is appropriate such as ground floor retail there are inconsistencies such as superblocks

7809950 employers need to take some responsibility for the impact that overwork can have on their employees health with our research showing that a significant amount of it workers find it difficult to maintain relationships or suffer ill health the uks culture of working long hours needs to be addressed as businesses look to derive as much value from their people assets as possible during lean times it is going to be imperative that we dont drive employees to burnout
7809951 despite the predicted downturn we are still suffering a skills crisis so it is essential that we dont disillusion our skilled workers at a time when we need them most
7809952 for far too long servers have been sold by expensive local firms as small businesses have been too intimidated to buy servers online even though the potential savings are huge
7809953 servers are the last it product to move online and the move is long overdue with serversdirect co uk we will do what no other online retailer can do provide great prices with nationwide service not only can we provide inexpensive hardware on a next day delivery but we can also offer the full range of it services including installation data migration and ongoing management no one else can offer this as efficiently and inexpensively as we can
7809954 since soft launching i have been delighted with the number of businesses that have come through the site sales have shown rapid growth and we have established key relationships with leading vendors such as hp and microsoft as a result we have been able to expand our team of sales specialists and pass on even greater savings to our customers
7809955 we had two servers installed earlier this year from serversdirect co uk and i can say that the service and speed that they gave us was truly fantastic
7809956 from the first contact we had to talk about our needs they were very helpful if they said they would get back to us they always did and very quickly we had a short timeframe to get the servers installed which they met on the installation day their tech guy was at our office at 8 30am and worked all day making sure that we got everything we wanted migrated from our desk tops to the servers and that most importantly everything worked and we understood how to access the information when we werent sure about something phoning the helpdesk was again very quick and helpful in summary if anybody wanted a company for it equipment i have no problems recommending serversdirect co uk
7809957 serversdirect co uk has proven itself as a value added reseller to both customers and hp they have continually shown excellent growth whilst increasing investment in customer marketing and education around hp proliant servers their customer offering has been to provide simple solutions to complex business requirements such as server deployment management and virtualisation serversdirect co uk has also acknowledged market requirements beyond server hardware and developed key isv and alliance links with organisations such as intel and microsoft we wish them continued success and support
7809958 intel is a market leader in developing power efficient and performance leading solutions for the majority of todays servers spanning entry level up to enterprise class the technology advisor micro site and product selection website that we have worked with serversdirect co uk to develop is a great example of how these technology solutions can be mapped to best suit the business needs of customers ranging from small medium business first server solutions up to scalable solutions for the datacentre

7809969 the worst thing you can be in this industry is a middle class white male if any middle class white male i come across says he wants to enter television i say give up all hope theyve no chance
7809970 i feel awfully sorry for white middle class men who went to oxbridge but im not sure they are the ones at the greatest disadvantage
7809971 obviously the people who really are facing the biggest struggle to make it into television are those from working class backgrounds and people from ethnic minorities if they are both working class and from an ethnic minority they really are up against it
7809972 do i think its a mans world in television that is the most ridiculous question i have been asked all week
7809973 mr paxman lists five women because he couldnt possibly name all the men in positions of power in tv because he would be there all bloody day
7809974 it seems to me that tv is a fantastic place for middle class white males they are very much judged to be the people imbued with a sort of gravitas that women are still struggling to achieve
7809975 when you look at whos making the editorial decisions we found only one out of 17 people was a woman if you look at the last series of have i got news for you out of 20 contestants they had four women there is a failure to represent women in terms of news and political content
7809976 ill pop out and do a couple of questions on it for you all the other journalists have got this number so you might as well use it
7809977 im going to invite onto the programme everyone who hates me
7809978 i said ill do a deal first half hour you can ask me anything you want and the second half hour i can ask you anything i want he wouldnt do it
7809979 i would question him about his role in the death of dr david kelly i remember hearinghis controversial piece on the today programme it was quite early but my kids had woken up i heard him mention a senior intelligence source and i immediately thought one of the top ten people in mi6 has grassed up the government it turns out to be poor old david kelly basically what gilligan did was what has destroyed so many otherwise good coppers theyve caught a criminal but they havent got the evidence so they falsify the evidence if gilligan hadnt distorted what kelly had said grossly exaggerated it kelly would be alive today
7809980 i told him to his face youve been responsible for one persons death stay away from my family get off my doorstep
7809981 i knew because i was mayor that the met were not investigating this
7809982 and so farewell to happy days theres no more cash for londons gays
7809983 broadly its a right of centre industry i know this because i was once a sony radio awards judge and they gave me 24 hours of tapes to listen to the pattern seemed to be that you got an old journalist and they would do an opening rant about myra hindley too many immigrants and put all homosexuals on a small island and drop a bomb then every bigot in the land would phone in an absolutely pointless exercise
7809984 london is 10 years younger than the national average theres a huge concentration of young people and theyre all having sex its the most fecund place in britain
7809985 its about how to run a campaign about saving water ive got to advise and then judge which team is the best which i will hate
7809986 the mayor of shanghai is flying me out for a conference in november aboutcity economics im doing the keynote speech about what i think the future is for shanghai and the government of hong kong has got me going out to discuss the environment
7809987 oh yes kens junket to shanghai to have exotic discussions about the growth of international financial centres
7809988 i just think boris is mad not to havegone that opening ceremony i suspect was the most extravagant spectacle in human history it was stunning to watch and im glad i went
7809989 youd got headlines saying suicide bomb backer runs kens campaign followed by kens adviser is linked to terror group which came as news to him the adviser as he had the second highest clearance for mi5 because he is the auditor for the ministry of defence then they said boris was the new messiah people came to the conclusion that it wasnt balanced reporting
7809990 every black person who worked for me was acrook and every asian was a terrorist was the broad theme
7809991 somebody inside the building broke into lee jaspers computer and downloaded eight years of letters and emails
7809992 how are you going to prove it by the time we knew there was no chance of finding anyones fingerprints it had most probably happened weeks if not months before the standard started using it
7809993 i particularly like the londonpaper because they set out to have a paper thats positive about london whereas if the only thing you knew about london was from the evening standard you wouldnt come here for fear of being mugged raped or ripped off its all doom like the daily mail
7809994 lord rothermere came to see me and i told him that i aimed to get the maximum amount for it and that if somebody else bids more than you do theyll get it i suspect a lot of the venom was because of their paranoid fear that i would try and rig the thing the reality is that its no great shakes to me whether its run by rothermere or rupert murdoch neither are going to be particularly progressive i was going to have an auction on the internet for the rights
7809995 we got three times what we expected we got so much more than we expected that we didnt need a bus fare increase this year
7809996 when i first got really interested in politics in the sixties all the quality papers had an entire page reporting mps speeches there would be the single salient point that was most important in a speech in the paper the next morning
7809997 when the media followed murdoch down the electronic route we were promised that the savings would mean more extensive foreign coverage and everywhere there is less than there was
7809998 there are people who never did anything and im not terribly interested in their opinions i dont want to pick out anybody but catherine bennett of the observer would be a good start why is anyone interested in her opinions has she written great literature produced great art work run a major corporation been elected to office or is she just paid to produce bile
7809999 you might as well pop into the local pub and say whats your opinion its equally valid
