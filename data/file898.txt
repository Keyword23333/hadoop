8980000 the continued claims by mr keelty that dr haneef was a person of interest which is the police euphemism for a suspect has continued and exacerbated the damage to dr haneefs reputation that the unreasonable and unjustified actions of july 2 2007 had already caused
8980001 we are ready to negotiate the terms of any apology and a damages settlement with the government so as to avoid the unnecessary expense and further angst of civil litigation
8980002 i have always had a plan to come back to australia and i still believe i have this option open
8980003 its just a matter of convincing my family it is very hard its my wife and my mother and my mother in law
8980004 peters made his decision that he did not seek the leadership of the party
8980005 as ive said before id be very happy if he changes his mind thats his business
8980006 i will lead us to the next election and as i have said many times before i would be happy for peter costello to change his mind about retiring and to remain in parliament
8980007 in the case of mr costello though he does prefer to be handed things on a platter
8980008 one thing about brendan is he took over the job straight after the election loss
8980009 i will be addressing a function tonight in melbourne in honour of the extraordinary public service to date of peter costello in australia
8980010 he is a truly great australian we are a stronger more prosperous and confident country as a result of peters management of the economy particularly over the last almost 12 years
8980011 there is no point being the treasurer of nsw if people arent prepared to make the difficult decisions around public sector reform
8980012 i will not be treasurer if the mini budget in november does not return the states credit rating to a sustainable path
8980013 im viewing this as if ive got a contract with the taxpayers of nsw i will step down as treasurer if the mini budget doesnt achieve this
8980014 im not hanging around to watch this states credit rating downgraded
8980015 this mini budget will require hard decisions to do that its crunch time because of ofarrell public sector reform is no longer a luxury its a necessity
8980016 i regard the power reforms as necessary but as a legacy reform issue the real reform is adjusting our revenues and expenditure there is no other way to get us into a sustainable position im not a seat warmer
8980017 i am well aware that there are catholic schools that make it their mission to do that to look after those disadvantaged kids
8980018 when we analyse how those schools are going we obviously are going to find that they confront a range of challenges given the student populations that they are teaching
8980019 theyve made it their vocation to make a difference to those kids and we obviously want to help them make a difference
8980020 that is why we are talking about additional resources for those schools
8980021 parents certainly have a right to know that their child is getting a quality education no matter which school they go to
8980022 this kind of agreement is only entered into if child protection workers believe a child will be safe
8980023 we the undersigned fairfax columnists believe the sacking of mike carlton is an unjustified and provocative act by fairfax management
8980024 it has long been accepted practice that when staff journalists are on strike columnists should also remove their labour
8980025 mike carlton did no more than would have been done by any of the undersigned had our deadline coincided with industrial action we remind the company that having set an example with mike carlton it may need to sack all the undersigned if it insists on this course of action
8980026 mike carlton is not a member of the sydney morning herald staff
8980027 over here you hear them talking about share price and restructuring but rarely about journalism
8980028 we are absolutely not disappointed at that price i think the record of people paying big prices for internet assets isnt really a great record
8980029 i am amazed that fairfax didnt do whatever it took to own control the largest employment recruitment website
8980030 i believe the only way for a company such as theirs which is heavily reliant and dependent on classifieds to insulate against the migration online is to ensure they are the dominant player online
8980031 i found no media model for a broadsheet classified dependent newspaper organisation that would pull me out of the hole i found myself in at fairfax
8980032 in hindsight i should have seen that classifieds tend to gravitate to the leading site in any category i should have done something other than try to compete head to head
8980033 we make no bones about the fact we do continue to see a leaking out of the bottom of the bucket when it comes to lineage classified advertising and that will no doubt continue
8980034 not the hard news not the international news not the business sport local news that is not part of the business that is being affected at all
8980035 its really mischievous of people to say that theres going to be a decline in the quality
8980036 they were almost struggling for words to express how they felt
8980037 inpex informed eric rippers chief of staff on monday august 18 that they had made their decision it is my firm understanding that decision was to locate the plant in darwin
8980038 i havent been told that inpex has made a decision to go to darwin
8980039 ive been told the opposite ive been told inpex is still determining its position mr barnett if he wants to go any further with this beyond name calling has really got to come up with some evidence so far no ones backed up his position
8980040 it is a shameful outcome that after nearly seven years this labor government and eric ripper in particular have not been able to find a site for them and that they would contemplate spending over 800 million to pipe the gas by sub sea pipeline around the top of western australia to darwin
8980041 that would be the most humiliating episode in the proud resources and mining petroleum history of this state
8980042 prices have risen from 2 50 a gigajoule to 8 in recent contracts and the expectation in requests for tender is that new gas will be sold in the 15 to 20 a gigajoule range
8980043 it is very important we know more about the competitive impacts of this situation
8980044 what the opposition needs to explain to west australian gas customers is why the howard government did nothing as gas prices continued to rise to pressure companies to pass on the 460million they reaped following that governments excise cut of 2001
8980045 relative immaturity and the dynamics of the western australian gas market
8980046 my first reaction was ive got to get to the embassy i have to get in there i have to be there because thats the community
8980047 it was a real cwa country womens association thing i thought about those marvellous women who really are under appreciated i thought about my mother and making sandwiches and things when theres a fire
8980048 i went into the embassy and there were these wonderful young people in there dealing with what we all knew but could not say that our friends and colleagues were dead the chances of finding them alive were really very small
8980049 and the place was littered with chip packets and kit kats and tim tams and thats when i said right this is your mother speaking you cant go on living on chips and tim tams you wont be able to work
8980050 i mean these people were working around the clock they had to be kept going and so thats what we did at the end of five days there wasnt a skerrick of food in this house
8980051 i dont believe in coming into a muslim country and trying to convert muslims islam is a wonderful faith i have huge respect for it as i do for judaism we are intimately entwined the three great abrahamic faiths and we need to deal with each other with a deep respect and interest
8980052 whenever theres somebody from indonesias leading muslim organisations muhammadiyah or nu nahdatul ulama or some other muslim scholars or clerics ill come to the lunch
8980053 theyre usually not aware that i have any particular interest once or twice its come up but it hasnt computed
8980054 so i had just asked her if she knew of an english language church where we could have the baptism done and then she asked me whether wed like her to do it at the residence
8980055 its a delicate position and theres attitudes on both sides that relate to that
8980056 when i came here i wasnt certain at all how that would play out and i was getting mixed messages from people in general
8980057 there were people who said this is going to be fraught with danger because there could be elements who for their own reasons would like to make it a difficult issue the wife of the australian ambassador and so on
8980058 my observation in 2 1 2 years is that that wasnt necessary that i didnt need to be super careful
8980059 first and foremost im engaged in the australia indonesia cultural social and political relationship
8980060 im here because my husbands the ambassador and thats the primary purpose i just have this other world that is linked
8980061 he joked that hed always fancied himself in a nice hat as though he were about to become the vicars wife
8980062 were more inclined to just roll their eyes at the idea
8980063 a sort of icon a symbol for what they wanted
8980064 i guess when i came here i felt a bit tired
8980065 i know i could preach in the anglican church here but they wont allow me to do the other things to use the altar as well as the pulpit and ive reached a point where ive thought this is not my problem
8980066 the two bali bombings the marriott bombing the embassy bombing the tsunami and then the plane crash
8980067 im constantly full of admiration for the professionalism of these people
8980068 because the issue was how do you throw away a friends business card how do you delete their name out of your phone
8980069 and when this was put to me i said well you do it liturgically which means you have a little ceremony you have structure
8980070 i may not have an institutional ministry but ministry in that sense is never confined by human institutions just as the activities of god are not confined by human institutions and what power brokers in the church think their rules allow or dont allow
8980071 the carbon price will be higher non assisted industries and firms will have to reduce their emissions even further and the impact on household budgets will be even greater
8980072 we will continue to assist the atsb to ensure that factors that may have contributed to the incident are understood and that any corrective actions ultimately identified are implemented
8980073 that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed
8980074 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8980075 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8980076 a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8980077 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8980078 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8980079 im sorry but i dont really have time to be helping out every state senator in the country
8980080 well i didnt expect him to invite me over for dinner during the campaign it was a hot and heavy campaign and it ended just a few weeks ago
8980081 he is probably one of the most experienced and brilliant politicians on the face of the planet today and he will want to go down in history i know as someone who assisted the democratic party in achieving success over john mccain rather than damaging the effort i have no real concern about that i think he will be a spectacular asset
8980082 one of the concerns that senator obama would have if he is elected president is the inflated expectations the unrealistic expectations that people who have viewed him so hopefully might have
8980083 so there will be an effort i think to deal with that in the early weeks and months of the administration
8980084 we have taken some hits because he has used the word hope so frequently he believes some of these problems can be solved he doesnt believe it can be done by jamming ideology down the throats of your adversaries
8980085 for example for us to get our healthcare system right is such a huge challenge it cannot be just democrats it has got to be republicans signing on to it and helping it happen
8980086 thats how we established all our most important social programs
8980087 we have got to solve these problems by bringing people together around the problems senator obama is hopeful and believes it can be done
8980088 he is realistic in that hes not going to usher in a paradise on earth he is going to be an effective leader and that by itself is going to be something different
8980089 he does not have a god complex that is just propaganda people who work with him who have worked with him in the senate do not believe he has a god complex he has very powerful rhetoric and he has ability that most american politicians are envious of and that is the power to move people with speeches and the power to attract people to his cause it is the power to bring people together the power to overcome obstacles and overcome resistance without resorting to demagoguery i defy you to say that his speeches are demagogic
8980090 my country and yours have a stake in seeing that natos first mission beyond europes borders is a success
8980091 for the people of afghanistan and for our shared security the work must be done america cannot do this alone the afghan people need our troops and your troops our support and your support to defeat the taliban and to develop their economy and to help them rebuild their nation we have too much at stake to turn back now
8980092 it is true he will as president ask the us to do more and our friends and allies to do more its not going to be a surprise
8980093 if you read that berlin speech in july carefully youll understand that he is challenging the germans and the europeans to participate and work together on a variety of issues including afghanistan which is not as popular as it once was
8980094 im not sure there is going to be any tension between barack obama calling for more sacrifice on global climate change i think everyone is waiting for americans to get the message
8980095 where it is rough is in these specific challenges of terrorism and having to deal with afghanistan and having to deal with non state actors who take advantage of porous borders and kill innocents
8980096 thats very difficult to work on because it requires sacrifice it requires people going into afghanistan to fight and die to prevent the taliban and re establishing itself not only americans but our allies as well
8980097 i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8980098 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8980099 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
8980100 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8980101 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8980102 i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8980103 finish the fight against and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8980104 i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8980105 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
8980106 well if you think obama is experienced then i guess you wont mind if i pick this little hottie
8980107 im sure shes trying we havent been off the phone for a second
8980108 i wouldnt start from here the 21st century and where it all went wrong
8980109 can a travel book on trouble tourism be responsible should a journey to war zones evoke belly laughs is there comic potential in a visit to gaza the answer is yes if that book is written by andrew mueller
8980110 the book can be read as a series of nicely modulated conversations revealing the human idiosyncrasies behind the headlines and as mueller is by training if that is the word a rock critic there is none of that old school foreign correspondent condescension
8980111 when every backpacker clutching an airline ticket and a well thumbed lonely planet guide seems to think their banal observations and clunky insider jokes merit book length treatment mueller manages to stand above the crowd a london based former rock journalist who was born in wagga wagga nsw hes an amusing and intelligent companion an accidental war correspondent who goes to the right places and isnt frightened to ask some very frightening people the right questions

8980117 three best friends who are taking hollywood by storm and playing by their own rules
8980118 dangerously unprepared for the presidency with republican national committee ads labeling obama as
8980119 but maybe thats the good news said the seasoned republican senator from texas who was said to be among mccains potential running mates
8980120 the fact that she doesnt know the ways of washington may be the best of all hutchison said in an interview aired by cnn calling palin an
8980121 hell be following the presidential camapign from afar sarah palin said in her appearance with mccain in ohio today with palin citing her pride in him and
8980122 pro life cause which mccain has pledged to make a central concern of his administration she was not dissuaded by prenatal testing of the child and has said of him
8980123 im looking at him right now and i see perfection yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
8980124 preparedness for the presidency will have to be addressed with a certain recognition that mccain has tapped someone who might have to stand in as president who carries a lack of national credentials unseen in a long time
8980125 architect of president bushs election campaigns dismissed his experience a governor for three years and mayor of 103rd largest richmond
8980126 currently there is no leader but oregon state seems to be mentioned the most probably because hes intrigued by the pac 10 barack obamas brother in law coach craig robinson and the curiosity of the school
8980127 i talked with the coaching staff they really like my game i thought the campus was nice it was a beautiful campus i could see myself playing for coach
8980128 i hope to be an impact player at whatever school i go to
8980129 i want to come into the game and make shots and make plays
8980130 the captain of ryanair flight fr9462 from milan bergamo to rome ciampino diverted to rome fiumicino as a safety precaution
8980131 the aircraft undercarriage had extended and the aircraft landed normally at fiumicino where passengers were disembarked for a coach transfer to rome the airline added
8980132 i cant say that since this convention started i havent thought about it because i have
8980133 i want to see how close to 60 votes we can get in the senate what the committee structure is and how best i can use my time
8980134 the job i do now i think is important and what i really want to do is make a difference
8980135 the question is how can i best do that is it using the seniority i have in the senate or is it in getting out there and running for governor
8980136 an diesem tag gibt es nicht viel positives ich hatte sehr viel untersteuern gerade in den mittelschnellen teilen generell scheint der audi etwas schneller zu sein
8980137 wir brauchen mehr grip auf der vorderachse ich vermute dass gilt f r alle 2007er wagen
8980138 im zweiten teil haben wir uns auf die long runs konzentriert und sind keine zeitenjagd gefahren ich sehe trotz der positionen vom nachmittag die chance auf die zweite quali session
8980139 das war kein einfacher tag f r uns aber wir haben das erwartet
8980140 uns erwartet viel arbeit wenn wir im rennen konkurrenzf hig sein m chten
8980141 wir wussten schon vorher dass wir hier einige schwierigkeiten zu erwarten hatten aber wir werden sicher nicht aufgeben
8980142 wir sind sehr geduldig und haben am nachmittag gute fortschritte gemacht aber es war nicht ausreichend um ein befriedigendes ergebnis zu erzielen
8980143 the woodbury police are excited because they got something thats more serious than a cat up a tree
8980144 this is a very unique case and frankly i dont know the ramifications of anything yet
8980145 were just always looking out the windows the whole neighborhood in general is feeling the same way
8980146 that to me is ridiculous i dont understand how that can happen
8980147 hes going to have to bang a little bit to get in at me and hopefully ill be able to wake up by then
8980148 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl told him that he had come up with a plan on how to murder someone
8980149 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl wanted to find an adult male who lived by himself and within walking distance of the defendants house
8980150 mr busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat mr busskohl told mr eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
8980151 im not even sure i would have gone through with it
8980152 the evidence i received he busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
8980153 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
8980154 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
8980155 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
8980156 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
8980157 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime
8980158 but if we have somebody thats just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime we cant charge an attempt and thats what this is all about
8980159 if it wasnt for his friend and the grace of god thatd be it
8980160 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride

8980163 although presumed clean many new recordings still have mold release compounds in their grooves thus requiring cleaning
8980164 the dio years would make more sense as a box set with remastered versions of each album
8980165 but once i found my emotion and once i understood what i was trying to get across it became a routine just like any other
8980166 its like theres a party in my mouth and everyones being sick
8980167 throbbing gristle will make me assault mankind an audio weapon a hate intensified
8980168 drenched in my own sick blood shit and piss shivering in terror i await the next hit

8980171 i learned so much about the 7pm slot from russell t davies doctor who scripts and from his approach as an executive producer to that particular slot
8980172 russells been a huge supporter of merlin he immediately saw its potential and proved invaluable in early discussions about how to shape the series for saturday night
8980173 camelot is a land where magic is banned and merlin is a young boy who works as arthurs manservant and has to hide his abilities
8980174 a finished product is a product of a decadent mind
8980175 she is also a solid pro life conservative who will relate very well with voters in oklahoma and many other states
8980176 i had a chance to meet with gov palin on energy issues during my recent trip to alaska and i was tremendously impressed with her dedication to assuring our energy future most of all she has an astonishing life story athlete reform governor who challenged a corrupt system and passed a landmark ethics reform bill a mother wife and leader i simply cannot imagine a better pick
8980177 choosing governor palin as the republican vice presidential running mate is a truly historic decision
8980178 this was a smart and savvy choice that proves john mccain is willing and able to think outside the box
8980179 the last time i was here i was performing at the grand which is always fantastic and i actually performed as the invisible man
8980180 i really love coming to the old place because the people are fantastic and they are always so enthusiastic theres been a doctor who museum here for years and the love for the show around here is amazing
8980181 novoraseljene osobe u goriju pri aju o zastra ivanju ak fizi kom nasilju koje u tampon zoni provode milicije
8980182 i will censor myself out of respect for jennie garth because shes friends with tori i got passages sent to me and a vast majority of it is incredibly exaggerated maybe its a difference of how i was raised i just dont believe you write personal on set experiences in a book for me when you work its almost a sacred experience whether you get along with everyone or not in 27 years of acting ive never sold out one of my cast members ever and i will stick to that
8980183 the neighbors in this area are complaining to us on a regular basis
8980184 the main issue for it is the neighbors this gentleman is coming out of his house and he doesnt need to see a guy pull off the main drag and pick up a prostitute right in front of his house
8980185 for whatever reason these girls are blatant and they dont care that were in uniform theyll walk right by us even if weve got our lights on talking to someone theyll walk right by us
8980186 ive driven around before and seen prostitutes getting slapped by pimps
8980187 im proud of the portland police because theyre out here doing their job i feel like im getting my moneys worth
8980188 only a physician and surgeon licensed in california is allowed to override treatment decisions
8980189 another valuable day in monza and we have learnt some interesting things that will help us prepare for the race here in a couple of weeks time we tried lots of different things with the set up and then did some suspension work in the afternoon as using the curbs is important here i think we have taken the car in the right direction and we have a good basis to build on over the race weekend
8980190 we spent the day looking at the set up and completing all the usual monza specific work because this place is so different to all the other tracks that we run at we continued with our race preparation programme collecting data and found some very positive directions with the set up so we are in reasonable shape going into the race here
8980191 sarah palins record is not extensive just two years ago she was the mayor of a city of less than 10 000 people but what her record indicates is troubling this spring she opposed the listing of polar bears as a threatened species she supports the brutal aerial hunting of wolves and she has been a friend of big oil opposing a windfall profits tax on the oil industry that could fund affordable clean energy for more americans palins husband works for bp
8980192 with the pick of alaska governor sarah palin for his running mate john mccains race towards the bush administrations failed energy policy is now complete

8980196 whatever you want others to do for you do so for them for this is the law and the prophets
8980197 i refuse to be a victim when this becomes your mantra constantly running through your head
8980198 i didnt expect much and i didnt get much because they dont want somebody there who will emphasize where theyre coming short
8980199 theyre lining up for the next fight and theyre going to have better numbers and theyre going to know the rules better
8980200 its just not the kind of thing i think i should do
8980201 theres a certain political comfort of just getting along with people
8980202 its sort of like asking me if theres a better person than myself to deliver the message i tried to deliver and i say sure theres probably plenty
8980203 the people who are most committed to him tend to be principally small government traditional republicans who may well sit this election out because john mccain does not support their positions
8980204 its also the so called affirmative action programs that the government passes to say well you must make loans to certain people that want to buy houses
8980205 we need less regulation by the government but more regulation by the market
8980206 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america

8980212 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president
8980213 she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
8980214 governor palin has challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent

8980218 her nalinis case for premature release is not considered since she has harboured sentiments for ltte and now also the problem continues
8980219 i actually feel bad for the posters who were scared about obamas lack of experience because this would put them in a quandary
8980220 she brings absolutely nothing to the table unless you come from the religious right wing of the republican party then she brings all the right votes and all the right priorities to the table
8980221 i am just shocked i didnt see it coming exciting actually however i am a mom of two small children and i couldnt do it she has five kids one a downs syndrome infant she must be an amazing person to even consider taking this on too
8980222 im stunned i really thought it would be mitt romney will be interesting to see how all plays out
8980223 i was thinking the working mom thing could be hurtful too she would be spending a lot of time away from her kids and family and that may not sit well with ultra conservatives which he needed to attract
8980224 think about this scenario if mccain wins and only serves 1 term we just might end up with a republican woman vs a democratic woman in 2012 now that would be interesting
8980225 i must not have been paying as much attention as i thought i know almost nothing about her guess i will have to look her up today
8980226 i also thought it was a smart move on mccains part choosing a women for the same reason there are a lot of unhappy hrc supporters out there who dont like obama
8980227 i was going to vote for mccain though i wasnt too thrilled but now i actually feel excited
8980228 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed

8980233 hunting and fishing are hobbies rooted in our american tradition often passed down from generation to generation like in the l l bean family
8980234 outdoor channel is the ideal home for a show with l l bean its the network that understands our passion for the great outdoors
8980235 while it does seem like an inopportune time for retail expansion l l bean is an unusual case
8980236 the brand just has phenomenal recognition and loyalty anyone in my generation who grew up on the east coast has seen or used these signature classics like the bean boot or the tote all their lives and no one seems to have tired of them yet
8980237 but this is still not the most robust period for retail
8980238 i dont know which is worse me looking like vicky from real housewives of orange county or pretend farmer looking like palin
8980239 too early to tell but i think this choice is going to end up biting mccain in the butt i have no problem with that
8980240 im listening to sarah palin right now lets see if something happens to john mccain fairly good chance due to his age she would be president scary is all i can say
8980241 hell yes it smacked me right in the face this is my damn shirt
8980242 mary thats the beuaty of the virtual world none of us know the answer to that question

8980249 goldman sachs gs sustain focus list which predicts the top corporate performers primarily by evaluating how well they integrate esg criteria into their businesses has outperformed the world stock index msci by 25 since august 2005
8980250 i believe that companies and investors need to shift attention from quarterly earnings guidance to investments and management decisions that focus on the long term growth and sustainability of the company
8980251 long term value creation guiding principles for corporations and investors
8980252 conversations with investment professionals in niche sustainability financial institutions portray a similar picture of mainstream investors as being primarily trained to assess fundamental financial data and not fully equipped to analyze esg criteria
8980253 sri is often seen as a separate type of investment that is focused on the dual goals of both financial and social environmental impacts
8980254 for esg criteria to become integrated into all investments investors need to believe that these dual goals are inextricably linked how companies manage their esg performance is a strong indicator of a company that is well managed overall one that will achieve superior financial performance over the long run
8980255 the yankees have no chance to get into the playoffs asserted one american league scout

8980261 i think bowas a tremendous coach one of the best third base coaches ive ever seen maybe the best but i dont think coaches make players players make players
8980262 with our system we were able to pick it up with relatively small numbers otherwise it might have gone unnoticed
8980263 it helped us to connect the dots in such a way that we were able to say we have something provincially going on
8980264 it gave me an opportunity to see for myself that he absolutely wants to call an election even if it doesnt jive with his legislation and even if he has to cancel the sept 8 byelections
8980265 i asked him what the priorities of the government were it wasnt very clear
8980266 i dont think anybody thinks this parliament would have lasted another year
8980267 certainly the opposition parties have been talking about defeating the government for quite some time now
8980268 stephen harpers the kind of person who knows where he stands hes a straight up guy
8980269 hes the steady hand we need when the worlds economy is so uncertain
8980270 we hope to end up with a body of work where its not necessarily clear whose hand has created which bits
8980271 people claim images as their own and we want to explore that
8980272 social media gets all these ad impressions but not necessarily get the dollars
8980273 category by category year over year were up double digits
8980274 we believe there could be issues with the measurement that could be misrepresenting yahoo and we are reviewing comscores methodology and working with them to resolve these issues
8980275 it shows how the redesign is allowing myspace to reach far beyond the social media advertising category and to target far larger
8980276 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
8980277 is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgement it shows political panic
8980278 i do believe that mccain has to do something to reshuffle the cards shake up the establishment do something unexpected and governor palin has all the kinds of things that mccain might see as a way to shake things up i think her selection would be something similar to dan quayle dan quayle proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough now mondale tried to shake things up by going with geraldine ferraro she proved to be a disaster as a running mate and as a campaigner she was absolutely awful and so i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
8980279 how we think about licenses is getting a bit more nuanced
8980280 eclipse is an important lively and healthy project with an enormous plug in and developer community that uses an otherwise duplicative license they arent interested in using the bsd or other open source licenses that are readily combinable with epl code
8980281 we have decided that after nearly 2 years of operation that it was time to add the epl and serve these open source developers
8980282 in that light our removal of the mpl from the site seemed a little absurd so our bad
8980283 were putting that option back up for new projects the groups that want to use the mpl to enable their additions extensions and more for firefox and other mozilla projects are legion and considering their recent summit represent a very healthy global collection of developers
8980284 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
8980285 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do
8980286 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time
8980287 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
8980288 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much

8980311 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
8980312 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
8980313 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
8980314 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
8980315 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board

8980336 veoh responded to compliant dmca takedown notices on a same day basis it notified users of its policies against it registered a copyright agent with the copyright office it terminated users who were repeat infringers and blocked new registrations from the same e mail addresses it used hashes to stop the same infringing videos from being uploaded by other users
8980337 if infringement is rampant right and left and anyone ought to be able to see it but you dont do anything about it then maybe you dont have
8980338 these clips on youtube are from saturday night live things that one can simply look at and say that must belong to somebody
8980339 even if the veoh decision were to be considered by other courts that case does nothing to change the fact that youtube is a business built on infringement that has failed to take reasonable measures to respect the rights of creators and content owners

8980368 more recently she has come under the scrutiny of an investigation by the republican controlled legislature into the possibility that she ordered the dismissal of alaskas public safety commissioner because he would not fire her former brother in law as a state trooper
8980369 monegan than alleged that he had been pressured to fire state trooper mike wooten who was married to palins sister and was involved in a contentious divorce according to the anchorage daily news
8980370 palin has denied any wrongdoing the state legislature voted on july 28 to hire an independent investigator to probe whether palin her family or members of her administration had pressured monegan to fire wooten according to the daily news
8980371 palin hasnt been implicated in the four year old federal corruption investigation which has resulted in convictions of or guilty pleas from three state legislators murkowskis former chief of staff and two executives of an oil services company as well as the indictment of senator ted stevens

8980375 in one implementation pressing a page down or page up keyboard key button allows a user to begin at any starting vertical location within a page and navigate to that same location on the next or previous page
8980376 for example if a user is viewing a page starting in a viewing area from the middle of that page and ending at the bottom a page down command will cause the next page to be shown in the viewing area starting at the middle of the next page and ending at the bottom of the next page similar behavior occurs when there is more than one column of pages being displayed in a row

8980470 large corporate customers increasingly appreciate the benefits of the common key management architecture underlying voltage products moreover our diverse product line is leading to larger and more strategic customer relationships one measure of that is the fact that we more than tripled our multi million dollar customer count over the past year
8980471 three customer decision points are driving the rapid adoption of voltage for these large enterprise deployments
8980472 first voltage is highly scalable to the largest numbers of users and applications second voltage has a proven track record of usability dramatically reducing help desk support and user training costs third voltage solutions are designed for rapid integration and the quickest path to production so roi is proven in days and weeks instead of the months and years typical of other key management approaches
8980473 im greatly appreciative of our clients and the entire obermeyer team who have together helped us achieve this distinction
8980474 and im particularly proud that a colorado based firm is being recognized on a nationwide level for delivering solid investment returns and world class service

8980476 this recognition is an indication of just how hard our entire team works to build relationships based as much on trust as on results

8980479 the successful results from the nitrogen tests for our patented water remediation unit are significant for wescorp
8980480 wescorp is now able to offer to lease these units to conventional oil and gas operators as well as heavy oil producers with an added selling feature by using wescorps solution for water remediation companies can further reduce their carbon emissions there are additional emission reductions through a decrease in service and repair work on injection and disposal wells this can result in significant cost savings and reduction in overall operating costs when oil and gas operators use our water management solution the advantages are numerous companies can operate in a more environmentally friendly manner decreasing operating cost and increasing profitability all at the same time we intend on using nitrogen generators on all future units including those going to kansas wyoming and texas as part of our large order for up to 256 units
8980481 we continue to make technological advancements to remain a leader in water remediation and management for the oil and gas markets
8980482 with the addition of kyoto credits being obtainable through the use of our water solution wescorps technology has again proven that it provides a positive environmental impact as well as strong economic advantages implementation of environmentally friendly technology often causes an increase in operational costs or a decrease in revenue our water remediation technology is different oil and gas operators can save money by using our system wescorps solution reduces the operators costs by lowering the expenses associated with water management waste removal processes transportation of waste material service and repair to the injection and disposal wells and environmental liabilities we believe that based on the strong economic and environmental advantages of our water remediation solution it will be very difficult for oil and gas operators not to adopt this technology into their water management strategy

8980488 in working with adlib software for the past four years ive had first hand experience seeing its document transformation products in action
8980489 adlib software is one of the select few partners out there that has great software that just plain works it plays a critical role in my customers deployments and the company has been available to answer support questions adlib has been a great addition to our portfolio
8980490 with the demand for our products reaching new heights it is a perfect time to reevaluate the importance of our var channel program
8980491 our applications recently went through a transformation making them much more strategic to document workflow solutions as such we see the var channel as the natural mechanism to accelerate the penetration of these solutions into the market
8980492 thousands of customers use adlib every day to improve a variety of document transformation processes
8980493 the new channel program provides an excellent opportunity for vars to derive new revenue streams from this growing demand and for end users to maximize the value of existing investments
8980494 ecm bpm and many other document centric product categories are driving a lot of revenue for the var community but vars need to look beyond the standard offering through complementary applications that make these solutions better vars that are willing to capitalize on the opportunities afforded to them by offering applications like adlib express server will have a clear advantage and drive a lot more revenue

8980498 as we were up to our eyeballs in s h i t books s h i t cds all sorts of s h i t multimedia and even promotional hats and shirts cover with s h i t
8980499 we knew there was a strong market for our s h i t but even i was surprised at how much s h i t we were able to sell in the first month
8980500 at first we thought that we may have to giveaway some of our s h i t to get athletes to go for s h i t but in the end the s h i t just flew out the door
8980501 we will protect our s h i t by all legal means
8980502 this has never been a case to ruin someones life

8980529 the first and most important thing you can do is to place a moratorium on all exploration and development where land claims remain unsettled thats your most important duty
8980530 mcguinty says mining is safe lets store the tailings and waste in his backyard
8980531 so youve grown an extra cranium you think it was the uranium
8980532 its important for politicians and human beings who care about this issue to come together as one to try to voice collectively our concerns about the danger this region could be in if something goes wrong with what they say is safe uranium product
8980533 we were counting on the revision of the mining act and the fact that theyve excluded uranium from it is really disappointing and totally crazy quite frankly
8980534 the first and most important thing you can do is to place a moratorium on all exploration and development where land claims remain unsettled thats your most important duty
8980535 mcguinty says mining is safe lets store the tailings and waste in his backyard
8980536 so youve grown an extra cranium you think it was the uranium
8980537 its important for politicians and human beings who care about this issue to come together as one to try to voice collectively our concerns about the danger this region could be in if something goes wrong with what they say is safe uranium product
8980538 we were counting on the revision of the mining act and the fact that theyve excluded uranium from it is really disappointing and totally crazy quite frankly
8980539 it would be a vibrant happening place instead of the stale stagnant and just derelict port that we have today
8980540 what is stopping all this from moving forward is the dispute over how much land the city should have weve been trying to give the caveated land back actually but they want all or nothing
8980541 i think that if the government is not going to respond there is an obligation on the part of the government to provide the people who participated in the consultation with a copy of the report
8980542 theres no reason that industrial commercial and residential cant coexist on the waterfront
8980543 i can tell you that under the conservative government in two and a half years we have a stronger safer healthier canada
8980544 one of the most reassuring things about the last six months the six months between nichols resignation on february the 12th and now has been how quickly and how meaningfully the various parts of the campus community came back together
8980545 thereve been a lot of relationships where these ties of trust needed to be restored
8980546 and its happened more quickly and more completely than i expected
8980547 president reveley has been simply remarkable in bringing the campus together and tackling our challenges
8980548 its looking much more unlikely that there will be a search process this year
8980549 the presidency evolved from being a pretty grim civic duty to pretty engaging challenge where i actually was having some fun
8980550 i think that hes made a commitment to the college
8980551 it would be strange to see him working so tremendously hard for what remained of last year and this year and then to stop
8980552 the state has been generous on the bricks and mortar front
8980553 the state has produced a lot of money to help us build buildings that we would not have been able to build if not for the state the
8980554 state appropriations are welcome but state funding is too unreliable to fuel our ambitions
8980555 when it comes to the operating budget the state it has become clear will no longer be a really dominant element in support
8980556 before the cuts that are coming almost certainly down the road we had thought the state would provide about 18 percent of our operating budget this year eighteen percent is a lot of help but it leaves 82 percent that has to come from private sources from tuition and fees from the yield on our endowment from annual giving from grants from anywhere we can cage private money
8980557 we are moving from a financial model that was publicly supported and privately assisted to one that is privately supported and publicly assisted
8980558 the era of being state supported and privately assisted is over is dead as a doornail is never coming back and we have no alternative but to figure out how to make an era of privately supported publicly assisted work for this college in this town
8980559 the rhythm of college and university campaigns is you start one you finish it you start planning the next one if you have your act together
8980560 what is it really that is so important so special about this particular institution
8980561 we are trying to capture that in words and get that message out in ways that really resonate with alumni resonate with politicians
8980562 were trying to raise a 10 million endowment for it which is not by any stretch of the imagination a large enough amount for it but it certainly beats the stew out of no endowment for it

8980570 while i greatly appreciate the attempts of the editors at the baltimore sun to comtemporize and beautify their newspaper i resent the addition of the fold over advertisement page covering the front portion of the front page of the paper i understand the need for additional income for any business by soliciting advertisment where possible but when a reader opens a paper they wish to see the beautiful colored headline your editors have so magnificently displayed and not the not so beautifully displayed talking mascot from mr mattress which greets me instead and requires some finagling before i get to the news
8980571 i am trying very hard to get used to the new sun i like to sit in my chair in the morning drinking my coffee and reading the paper i am finding it very hard to do the main section is so big i cant hold it ive been reading the paper for a very long time as i am 76 years old im just one of many so my words may not mean much but i got along better with small sections
8980572 i really enjoy the new format of the baltimore sun however i totally disagree with how you now display the weather i agree with its placement up front but its so small i can hardly read it not to mention completely uninteresting one would think with all of the other color and other new things youve added to the paper that the weather page would get some spicing up too but the complete opposite has happened its very disappointing
8980573 ive been very unhappy with the suns sports section since you made it a tabloid

8980582 it seems interesting we should take advantage of all the wind in this area
8980583 were very much in favour of wind turbines if theyre in the right place but whether theyre in the right place here is questionable
8980584 ill trust theyll do a really good job in terms of the environment
8980585 the only thing green about this is the money they the company are making
8980586 were not looking to overrun the county with turbines as some of our competitors are
8980587 thats why we chose a sparsely populated area of the county
8980588 reinvent how tv fans in print and online connect with their favorite shows
8980589 we are pleased to have an opportunity to work with one of the most respected entertainment brands to help change the dynamic of how a franchise like entertainment weekly and the tv world can be combined to create a whole new level of service for the reader and the viewer
8980590 tivo is all about providing easy solutions so that television viewing can be molded to an individuals lifestyle and
8980591 we ramped up early and got some things in here but this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling
8980592 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit
8980593 its been a little bit of a puzzle but its all worked out very nicely
8980594 everything down to that last stapler to that office set
8980595 youll see some more trucks like this coming through and well have more equipment itll be everything from office furniture to computers to a lot of the equipment for basketball operations

8980601 most dating agencies have more women than men 60 40 thats an encouragement for the men to sign up but unfortunately sometimes their social graces are not up to scratch so the dating agency told me another story they arranged for a guy to meet a date and the setting was a romantic dinner in a nice restaurant the guy turned up in slippers so he counseled the guy the guy says that is me i work in slippers i walk in slippers i come in slippers so they talked to him finally persuaded him to buy a pair of shoes keep the shoes in his car so before getting down at the date he puts on his shoes he meets he goes for the date and it worked
8980602 the total fertility rate that is the number of babies per married woman has plunged below the replacement rate of 2 1 since 1975 the rate last year was 1 29 putting singapore in the company of countries like japan and korea which also have dangerously low rates
8980603 to critics the focus on educated men and women today is merely a politically correct way of targeting the ethnic chinese in fact in the early days of the sdu the divergence in birth rates across racial and socioeconomic classes was a stated reason for taking action
8980604 are working on this theyre doing a very good job now theyre catering to different markets graduates non graduates sdu graduates sds non graduates

8980614 as a highly partisan dem who has been wishing and hoping and waiting for obama to do what we in the blogosphere have been asking for for so long from our dem leadership draw a sharp contrast with the republicans and bring the fight to them im a satisfied customer tonight
8980615 an extraordinary choice pro life conservatives across the country have to be thrilled with john mccains selection of sarah palin as the gop nominee for veep reformers have to be thrilled inside baseball analysts have to be thrilled
8980616 well done sen mccain gov palin is just a superb superb pick and so deftly handled
8980617 a year ago few would have predicted a republican ticket that including maverick john mccain and an attractive female conservative governor who has stood up to the republicans in her state if you had to imagine a ticket that could possibly defeat obama you couldnt have scripted it any better than this
8980618 a terrific choice palin is by all accounts a principled conservative and government reformer who can contribute mightily to the decision making that occurs in the white house she has more executive experience in her two years as governor than obama joe biden and mccain combined she is a mother of five in what appears to be a loving and functioning family and she is someone republicans conservatives and others can rally behind in the future from a purely tactical aspect palin would knock the legs out from under obamas monopoly hold on change and attacks on her inexperience will only highlight one of obamas greatest vulnerabilities and hes at the top of the democrat ticket and because hillary clinton spent months telling women voters that they are being dissed by obama some percentage of women who normally would not vote for mccain will take a second look if palins on the ticket there is no question that a palin selection would cause the obama camp headaches
8980619 what an unbelievable head fake by mccain perfectly executed to build suspense and knock the one off the front page this morning mind blowing im woozy
8980620 she is everything obama is not a real reformer who took on her own partys corrupt establishment and won defeating an incumbent governor 80 20 dont forget that shes also a mother who chose life for her down syndrome baby we can probably guess where shed fall on the born alive act if this is the future of the gop theyre in good shape
8980621 ive been very lukewarm on mccain but ill be very excited if palin s on the ticket she is the sort of principled limited government conservative thats been in very short supply in washington d c of late so shes just what the party needs
8980622 im worried about palin im afraid she may be the geraldine ferraro of 2008 if she really is the nominee will it come across as a desperation move a hail mary as walter mondale s choice of ferraro did in 1984 im afraid so her experience just doesnt justify a place on the ticket if mccain really wanted to go radical la gov bobby jindal was the far sounder choice but maybe jindal turned him down on the theory that he needs to do his job as governor of louisiana before trying to go national the most important thing mccain has going for him in this race is the perception that he is the serious candidate choosing a running mate who will be widely perceived as unqualified would go a long way toward squandering that advantage
8980623 inexperience palin has been governor for about two minutes thanks to mccains decision palin could be commander in chief next year that may strike people as a reckless choice it strikes me that way and mccains age raised the stakes on this issue tokenism can anyone say with a straight face that palin would have gotten picked if she were a man compatibility it doesnt seem as though mccain knows palin well do we have much reason to think they would work well together debates maybe as jonah goldberg said the other day biden will look like a bully going up against her and maybe shell shine but i can think of a lot of other picks who would have been lower risk
8980624 i really dont think someone with only 2 years of relevant experience she was elected governor of alaska in 2006 should be the vice president i also think her selection would undercut mccains not ready to lead attacks on obama although in all fairness i think someone who has been a governor for 2 years is more qualified to be president than someone who has been a senator for 4 years the bottom line however is that neither of them is really qualified
8980625 the sarah quayle palin pick is an abandonment of the obama is not ready to lead attack lines those are dead and to be honest while that line didnt work for hillary and it had limited traction for mccain it still had some traction that attack line is gone quayle palin is also a an ideologue on choice on the environment on energy all the way down the line this an ideological pick in an election where self identified republicans are a dying breed and democratic self identification is skyrocketing mccain has abandoned any notion of playing for the center hes looking to shore up his right flank and hoping that the evangelical right can somehow drag mccain over the line
8980626 when was the last time we saw a speech like tonights a full throated defense of progressive principles devoid of mushy centrist crap it didnt avoid the tough social issues like abortion guns or gay marriage it wasnt apologetic unlike bill clinton s and bidens it didnt unnecessarily praise john mccain it drew sharp distinctions between democrats and republicans it came from the democratic wing of the democratic party to be honest this is the speech aggressive and unabashedly populist i expected biden to give i couldnt be more pleased to have gotten it instead from the standard bearer himself
8980627 as a highly partisan dem who has been wishing and hoping and waiting for obama to do what we in the blogosphere have been asking for for so long from our dem leadership draw a sharp contrast with the republicans and bring the fight to them im a satisfied customer tonight barack obama left behind some of the more squishy post partisan rhetoric and did what he had to do define mccain as bushs third term eight is enough might be a slightly cheesy tag line but it works youll remember it and youll say yeah eight is enough and we cant afford republican rule any more this was the speech from someone who is ready to roll up his sleeves and get in the fight good show
8980628 what i especially like about this speech is that its a defense of liberalism a full throated rebuttal to the notion that government is bad and irreparably broken the speech itself is stunning in how it wraps policy details around piercing rhetoric
8980629 i have never seen barack obama give a better speech i have never seen anyone give a better political speech
8980630 grand slam doesnt even describe this speech obama is kicking ass mostly john mccains ass
8980631 that was a helluva speech wasnt it damn the setting was perfect the stage was perfect obamas cadences were perfect and it was just about as good a political rallying cry as ive ever heard john mccain looks very very small right about now
8980632 obama has probably given better speeches before but never a better political speech hes never blended so many parts into a seamless whole like this before he gave red meat at the beginning and post partisan inspiration at the end he blasted mccains record and judgment and then challenged us all not to question each others character he was personal bringing his family and life experience into his policy discussion but then he said this election is all about us and yet none of this seemed to be contradictory or discordant it was a masterpiece
8980633 its tricky to go on the offensive while maintaining an optimistic and inspirational tone but thats precisely what made obamas speech so effective he didnt just take the fight to mccain he eviscerated mccain his worldview his party and his record obama took mccains claims and debunked them he took mccains talking points and mocked them remember the questions about obamas toughness his willingness to mix it up neither do i the speech was also strikingly self aware obama knew exactly what detractors have been saying and the areas of doubt for voters does he have a clear agenda is he more talk than substance celebrity taxes and methodically almost surgically made his case
8980634 no barack obama did not land a knockout blow tonight but he showed that he fully understands that the best defense is a good offense after weeks of absorbing punishment from john mccain obama went on the attack obamas decision to target mccain so closely was a risky strategy but it paid off the contrast with past democratic candidates such as john kerry and michael dukakis could not have been starker obama showed that he does not conform to the image of the democrat as wussbag by directly assailing mccains foreign policy credentials specifically his claim that he would follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but why just follow as obama made clear he needs to be taken out
8980635 much of the end of the speech sounded defensive from finding common ground to defending patriotism to decrying character attacks to not being the typical candidate i didnt feel comfortable during that part of the speech answering attackers when the night is entirely focused on you both accepts the premise of their attacks and gives them free air time i wish there had been quite a bit less of that
8980636 this was not an uplifting unifying post partisan speech it was a typical democrat speech an act of attack to disguise a record thinner than that of any president it was an act of religious prayer for the believers not evangelism to the nonbelievers when he declared he would engage in specifics he continued to offer even more promises without explanation of how or why just that here was the thing wrong and in electing him president that alone would correct the wrong
8980637 obama made the same mistake that plagued the entire democratic convention he ran against george bush he railed about the previous eight years which certainly is de rigeur for the party out of the white house but failed to present any clear idea of what different policies he would apply he did almost nothing to present any specific positive plan for the american people beyond the sloganeering to which obama has bitterly clung while his polling has dropped by double digits this summer
8980638 a lot of people are emailing me to say that they have made their first mccain donation tonight maybe mccain shouldnt speak next week and replay obamas speech instead
8980639 was there a single sentence in obamas speech that could not have come from goldberg
8980640 the expectations for the speech were sky high and quite frankly obama didnt meet them it was definitely too long and he tried to do too many things in it without successfully accomplishing any of them he attacked bush weakly attacked mccain weakly talked about unity gave a shallow run through of some of his policies and trotted out a lot of tired socialist rhetoric
8980641 there was no innovative thinking in last nights speech all of the problems of american boiled down to the fact that the government just hasnt spent enough regulated enough or mandated enough
8980642 this was an angry speech as these things go and like joe bidens a dishonest one if the mccain campaign wanted to provoke obama it succeeded the political environment may be such that independent voters will have no problem with obamas stridency the kind typically associated with vp nominee but if they are that upset obama need not have given a speech
8980643 i dont think it was as impressive as his 2004 convention speech but it was serviceable and tough its going to come down to what the threshold question of this election is if it hinges on whether people want to definitively turn the page on the bush years obama knows how to make that argument and its one republicans will lose if the electorate expects something from the candidates resume to prove they can deliver on the change they promise the democrats have shown they cant really make that case thats the republicans one opening
8980644 a very good very eloquent very powerful case for a cause i do not believe in it was delivered well the atmospherics were impressive if more than a little bit imperial but at the end of the day we have to decide whether we are going to buy into a political ideology merely because it is dressed up in eloquent words
8980645 the associated press decides to double down in its attacks on barack obama heres the headline from charles babingtons analysis of obamas speech tonight analysis obama spares details keeps up attacks amazingly it actually gets worse reading almost exactly like republican talking points and in fact parroting that exact spin it is not until after the lede that babington admits that 35 minute speeches are rarely chock full of details particularly those that are enthralling to a crowd by the way it is also below the lede that babington admits that the obama speech did actually include specifics what a true journalist would do would be to analyze the speech without using the crutch of opposition talking points without resorting to the easiest he said she said type of stenography but apparently this is no longer the policy of the associated press under washington bureau chief months in talks with the mccain campaign about possibly accepting a senior level position no what we get out of fourniers ap is pure and unadulterated talking points that are as non germane as they are simply incorrect
8980646 to summarize obamas critics say he doesnt talk about details
8980647 as part of the aps continuing descent into absurdity they covered barack obamas speech with this he said he would cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families but did not say how how his staff would have to work with the staffs of the relevant members of congress on writing a bill then the bill needs to get out of committee pass the house and the senate maybe go through a conference committee process and then be signed into law what does babington mean how
8980648 babington wrote this piece before obamas speech was finished obamas speech ended just shy of 11 p m et babingtons attack piece was posted at aug 28 11 26 pm edt the piece is 603 words so we are to believe that babington watched the speech gave it due consideration wrote it turned it in had it go through editing had it go through copyediting and had it posted online all in 26 minutes
8980649 olbermann was outraged that the aps babington had written in his analysis of the speech just off the wire that obama had tried nothing new and that his speech was lacking in specifics
8980650 the dems strategy against mccain will one day seem either brilliant or stupid where the republicans went directly at kerrys character and will do the same with obama the democrats have decided to accept mccains character as a given served this country honorably even kerry whose speech was the toughest and most specific critique of mccain drew the line between senator mccain still an honorable man and candidate mccain plainly the democratic party and the obama campaign have made the judgment probably well informed by polling that mccains wholly undeserved reputation for integrity independence and personal decency is so firmly established that its not worth the effort and money to dismantle it that requires a very nuanced message separating senator mccain from the conservative republican agenda that he has no choice but to accept as its candidate if it works its briliant because it is the strategy that been urging for months a full and unhesitating critique of conservatism as an ideology that has now been put to the test and failed absolutely
8980651 washington vice president dick cheney s office announced today that he will speak at the upcoming republican national convention in st paul mn offering farewell wishes and personal observations about john mccain to anyone in the vicinity of his seat in the upper balcony the vice president has prepared a number of remarks to mutter angrily during sen tom coburn s speech cheney spokeswoman megan mitchell said we cannot divulge the specifics of his address at this time although i imagine it will begin shortly after he spots lieberman although no advance copy of the speech has been provided cheney is expected to cover a variety of hot button issues including the war in iraq barack obama the conflict in georgia the idiots they have speaking at these things legroom the workers at the concession stand the heat in this frigging place and president bushs tie cheney may also indulge his surrounding audience by engaging in a brief but loud debate with his wife on the issue of why he had to come in the first place and delivering an inspiring set of closing remarks to convention security on the benefits of fucking yourself

8980665 ive been happy at the club on the field its been going well but i knew offers had come in through the summer i thought the best thing for me to do was that ask for a move
8980666 everything with the manager is fine but there were certain issues at the club i was looking for a move up in the contract to reflect the offers put in that were rejected
8980667 obviously the club decided to accept the request and sell me on
8980668 there was nothing from me saying im worth this to the club but i knew offers had come in over the summer and the clubs turned them down thats the clubs valuation and the players wages must reflect that value
8980669 it goes hand in hand but that chapter has gone

8980703 we dont remember seeing voting rights for convicted pedophiles among steve beshears campaign promises last fall
8980704 before it was local officials turning a blind eye to berrys abuse of children now hes getting favorable treatment from state government
8980705 have served their sentence paid restitution and have no outstanding warrants
8980706 maybe the governors office could inform the families who were affected by berrys depredations how he has paid restitution
8980707 basically what the governors office is saying is that we shouldnt be concerned about the fact that he has given a partial pardon to one convicted pedophile who serves a little time because his policy is to give it to all of them
8980708 the other argument coming out of the governors office is that this partial pardon is okay because no one objected maybe we missed it but we dont remember beshear asking about this at any of his town meetings
8980709 im worried obviously about being prosecuted over this but im so angry
8980710 in this country we have the richest fishing grounds in the world around our coast yet we have an industry on the verge of collapse
8980711 according to herodotus the babylonians managed to find husbands for all their young women they collected together whatever maidens might be of marriageable years and sold them by auction beginning with those esteemed the most beautiful they gradually proceeded downwards in the scale of comeliness until some damsel equidistant between beauty and plainness had to be given away gratis then the plain and the ugly and the deformed were brought out by degrees and the bidding went on but in the other way the premiums obtained for beauty being spent as dowries for the less favoured all the women found husbands and all the husbands found what they desired

8980726 this is certainly another challenging schedule for our team one that will get us prepared for big 12 play and hopefully have us playing some of our best basketball at the end of the season
8980727 there are obviously some tremendous tests on this schedule but with a number of home games our fans will have a chance to come see this team develop and mature throughout the year
8980728 this is exactly the type of schedule our young team needs
8980729 including the exhibitions we will play our first five games at home then well have the opportunity to go on the road and test ourselves against some excellent opponents
8980730 we are excited to be able to give taylor back a scholarship
8980731 obviously last fall he and his family displayed a great amount of generosity and unselfishness towards our basketball program when a scholarship became available in may it was a no brainer to award it to taylor
8980732 the high number of post season teams from a year ago is indicative of how tough our schedule is in and out of league play
8980733 in league play we start on the road and end on the road but in between we have eight excellent home league games in addition to tulsa and winthrop two post season teams it stacks up as one of the toughest schedules weve had

8980770 selling 3 500 copies of the royal albert hall set is pretty amazing
8980771 but its not about making huge profits because vinyl sales are still a small fraction of overall sales about one percent of current music sales are vinyl its about branding us people at this big record company are really committed to having things sound right sound great and we want people to know
8980772 who knows why people are interested in blue oyster cult again
8980773 maybe its guitar hero who knows what we do know is that people are craving better sound quality and they want these core classics
8980774 so if theyre giving vinyl room they really think its going to be profitable
8980775 i hope to see vinyl in more chains but i dont think its going to happen
8980776 im not even convinced this trend will go on much longer the numbers just arent that significant that said well happily take the sales we can get there is that small steady customer demand for vinyl and we want to fill that demand whatever it is
8980777 to me this is a challenge when a certain person in the boxing industry hbos larry merchant first mentioned this it stuck in my head yes i am older and bigger and yes he is younger and stronger when freddie roach said manny pacquiao the fighter i trained can beat you it started to become personal to me to me its a challenge because people are talking about manny pacquiao can beat me well we will see on dec 6
8980778 this fight will really be a difficult fight for me but i know some people say it is a very easy fight for oscar but you know what i always do my job in the ring to give a good fight i think i can beat de la hoya i saw his last match and i think i am faster and stronger than him and i am younger also i believe i can beat him in the way that i beat david diaz in my last fight my speed oscar does have a height advantage but i believe i am stronger than him it is going to be a great fight on dec 6
8980779 production will be shut down in the path of the storm
8980780 not every rig will be in the storms path but the oil companies tend to be very cautious
8980781 platforms have to withstand not just the winds but also waves rain and currents
8980782 if the storm was heading west or east then companies could just shut down one region of the gulf
8980783 but it looks to be heading through the center so a good portion of the gulf will be shut down
8980784 depending on the timing and impact the storm could really move this market
8980785 its not a far stretch to see oil back over 125 and gas back above 4
8980786 the bottom line is what the damage to the refineries will be but the markets still tend to overreact
8980787 well likely see a big spike in the price of gasoline prices
8980788 yes there will be an impact on the market but were much better prepared now than we were before katrina and rita
8980789 the only man in this campaign who has really fought for america
8980790 hillary clinton put 18 million cracks in that glass ceiling well guess what the women of america arent done yet
8980791 its going to affect the sales of the record and its not fair
8980792 in the past these may have been viewed as victimless crimes
8980793 but in reality theres significant damage this law allows us to prosecute these cases
8980794 but the public is going to have much less sympathy with pirates

8980797 he got caught not paying his taxes for seven years and was forced to pay a half million dollars in back taxes and fines
8980798 said he only paid his taxes because it was hurting his campaign
8980799 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8980800 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8980801 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8980802 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall

8980809 i am truly disappointed and disturbed to learn that a member of this administration contacted the department of public safety regarding trooper wooten
8980810 at no time did i authorize any member of my staff to do so
8980811 i believe that people will look back and assess how hillary was treated by the media during the campaign primaries and it remains to be seen whether or not the ugly head of sexism in the media will raise its head again
8980812 i must be a non christian have non christian blood or at least have sympathized with a non christian sometime in my career
8980813 we have gotten so much better in a weeks time
8980814 we have constantly improved with each practice and looked pretty good today we had an outstanding workout this morning and our players attitudes have been unbelievable with their work ethic and their desire to learn i cant tell you how thrilling it is that we are able to make this trip i cant wait for the opportunity to see how we are and how we react in a game situation
8980815 the more the players have a chance to work with each other the more their confidence grows we will be trying to evaluate personnel and trying to see who can play under situations we have put in our man defense and our man offense and just the basics of what we are doing here those are the benefits of this trip
8980816 social media gets all these ad impressions but not necessarily get the dollars
8980817 category by category year over year were up double digits
8980818 we believe there could be issues with the measurement that could be misrepresenting yahoo and we are reviewing comscores methodology and working with them to resolve these issues

8980838 the fact that she is not a washingtonian that she is outside the beltway is in her favor
8980839 we hope it can help inform people about the assessment of the uk mobile sector and how its going and give a wider group of people than we might otherwise reach a chance to understand what ofcoms doing in this area and debate the issues
8980840 the fact that she is not a washingtonian that she is outside the beltway is in her favor
8980841 its not clear to us why the chicago survey is so strong or whether it can last
8980842 but it is hard to imagine it would generate such a jump in a single month
8980843 these movements are made very rapidly within about 200 milliseconds but within that time the animal determines where the threat is coming from and activates an appropriate set of movements to position its legs and wings
8980844 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8980845 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position

8980861 wat begon als een ludieke actie begint nu totaal onverwacht zijn vruchten af te werpen voor de economie van het gebied waarin ze geworteld zijn
8980862 daarnaast krijgen ze een voedzame bemesting van koeienmest die in de buurt wordt opgehaald bij de boeren dat doet het goed ze zijn nu ongeveer 2 10 meter hoog
8980863 ach ja niet getreurd de andere kant van de medaille is dat de actie een hoop betekent voor de economie in het plaatsje dat vind ik al genoeg

8980868 they have no fear they catch it and they go and hit it
8980869 i think theyll be all right once the kickoff goes and they get their first hit theyll be in good shape
8980870 preparation for bad weather has been at the top of mind and we prepare for it all year
8980871 there is no reason why joe public cannot do this save themselves a bit of money and help the environment because they are not using fossil fuels
8980872 whenever people have had oil they have been really really willing to give it its a waste product for them so we are taking away their rubbish
8980873 with petrol prices so high lots of people are looking for ways to reduce their fuel bills and this is a fantastic way to do it
8980874 hace unos siete u ocho a os cuando un asistente editorial de marvel cuyo nombre no recuerdo me llam para preguntarme si estaba interesado en realizar un especial titulado iron man the end bob se puso en contacto conmigo y pens que podr amos ofrecer una propuesta intrigante con el personaje algo que no se me hab a ocurrido hacer antes
8980875 desde la oficina editorial de entonces pusieron algunas objeciones a nuestra propuesta y ofrecieron lo que a sus ojos eran cambios menores sin embargo bob y yo pensamos que aquellos cambios podr an alterar el positivo impulso que hab amos puesto ambos en la historia y muy a nuestro pesar renunciamos al encargo a finales del 2006 las circunstancias cambiaron y el proyecto fue recuperado hicimos algunas alteraciones menores con las que todos pod amos vivir y el resultado saldra publicado inicialmente nos ofrecieron el proyecto bajo la premisa de que imagin ramos que nunca hab amos dejado la serie y que este ser a el n mero final de la misma as que nos parec a normal seguir al personaje hasta el final de su carrera como superh roe unos 40 a os en el futuro y ver c mo reaccionaba ante un problema tan mundano como es el de envejecer sin superpoderes o un gen mutante tony stark es s lo un ser humano y tiene que enfrentarse a la posibilidad de no ser capaz de volver a vestirse su incre ble armadura este tony stark es el mismo que lo era en nuestras historias del pasado salvo que es m s viejo y tiene nuevos problemas que afrontar estas 44 p ginas no son muchas cuando tienes un buen mont n de cosas que contar bethany cabe juega un papel primordial y aparece ultra dynamo la versi n futura de dinamo carmes para a adirle algo de la necesaria acci n la historia est espec ficamente centrada en tony
8980876 the word referendum has a technical and legal connotation i chose not to use it if we consult the people in a general election and this is made an election matter then if we win the elections we have the endorsement of the public thats how it works
8980877 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise its never too late for the brain and body to recover
8980878 this suggests that the brain is responsible for the improvement we saw in patients walking ability it seems to be recruiting other regions to take on the job of areas damaged by stroke
8980879 many stroke survivors believe theres nothing to be gained from further rehabilitation but our results suggest that health and functional benefits from walking on a treadmill can occur even decades out from stroke
8980880 we believe exercise gives individuals a way to fight back against stroke disabilities
8980881 why are all you people so bothered that mary kate smokes can you not see how it adds to her edgy cool image she has go
8980882 early learnings of was good and it was fun for me being in the studio for the first time and getting to play with all these toys and flashing lights but on this record ive been working with other musicians and its come out with that band element that i wanted quite a lot of the album was done live and i wanted to project that natural feel i didnt get a load of session musicians together in a big studio i just got a couple of friends in and we worked to generate something that had a little bit more character
8980883 there are songs on the album that just come out quite melancholy like black and white movies knock down ginger and god in space but other times itll be the pogues or the kinks
8980884 i was born in london and grew up in essex but i went to university in liverpool im a bit of a three headed monster liverpool london ireland all of them have influenced me in some way i find it quite a weird thing to talk about where someone comes from it always seems to end up defining a person and people would instantly associate you with a particular sound or with a particular group of people i want to try to avoid that
8980885 a lot of the songs on the record are unapologetically romantic like black and white movies but then on the other hand its quite a filthy record
8980886 we said farewell and we synchronized our watches arranged for the meeting of our crotches
8980887 a lot of the stories behind the songs are completely fabricated which wasnt the case with the last one there are only a few drawn from personal experience because i found i had more fun making things up there are bits little knowing winks and phrases that are drawn from real life but mostly its just little made up scenarios
8980888 its a phrase ive always used but im not sure if its something that i made up or not
8980889 now that we have an accurate way to count these cells we are able to confirm what we long suspected that blacks might have a bigger army of hla specific b cells
8980890 if the recipient is not sensitized b cells represent only a patients potential for making antibodies
8980891 however about a third of patients in need of a kidney are sensitized since theyre often on their second or third transplantation and may have undergone transfusions
8980892 knowing that blacks have an increased number of hla specific b cells which increases their opportunity for antibody mediated rejection we may be able to customize treatments for black recipients to account for these differences and lessen the likelihood that the organ will be rejected
8980893 in a year where hrc voters arent moving to obama picking a woman could peel away those voters this will be a very interesting election
8980894 genes control cravings and so i cant help be fat
8980895 we ought never to do wrong when people are looking
8980896 i believed that i only have a certain amount of time and energy for romance so it is best spent with someone that is open to all the various possibilities of its development
8980897 i love who i love marriage may put restrictions on how i can be with married men but it doesnt seem to impact how i perceive them and how i experience the fit with me i still believe i wouldnt pursue a married man wouldnt let myself open to him knowing he was married both these two just snuck in
8980898 ive been happily married for four years but recently i found an old boyfriend on the internet sometimes we have cybersex and i think it has made my sex life with my husband better even though we will never meet in person doing this makes me feel like im cheating
8980899 the way a philanthropist shares her money because they have a lot of it to share because it makes them happy to share it because sharing makes the world a better place
8980900 i told you she was good sure hope e remembers us little folks when she makes it big time
8980901 i enjoyed reading e today very well written if your mother does say so herself and just the right touch of humor
8980902 why are all you people so bothered that mary kate smokes can you not see how it adds to her edgy cool image she has go
8980903 i didnt know what i wanted for the country before now but now i realize that barack obama is the only person who can bring pride back to america
8980904 sales have been under pressure for so long even before the retail environment became challenging
8980905 one of the concerns is that the company continues to lose market share and in that case theres only so much it can do in terms of cost cutting and realigning the organization
8980906 controlling expenses and tight inventory demand is going to help them achieve that goal
8980907 the running mate who can best help me shake up washington
8980908 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
8980909 to have been chosen brings a great challenge that will demand the best that i have to give and i promise nothing less
8980910 as evidence that he can deliver the change we need
8980911 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 per cent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8980912 well its time for them to own their failure its time for us to change america
8980913 doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8980914 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million
8980915 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8980916 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8980917 but i stand before you tonight because all over america something is stirring
8980918 what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8980919 at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future
8980920 the acceptance of a democratic presidential nominee decided not by the colour of his skin but by the content of his character
8980921 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8980922 john mccain likes to say hell follow al qaida leader osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8980923 we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8980924 dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
8980925 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meagre record of barack obama
8980926 he offered the money and i accepted it that was wrong
8980927 it was greedy of me and i know that was ethically wrong
8980928 were glad the matter has been resolved but reject totally what the defendants said in court as to their dealings with dylan howard
8980929 a witness was present for all dealings between dylan and the individuals in question
8980930 we support dylan howard and can vouch for the fact that dylans conduct was entirely appropriate
8980931 the sco states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the south ossetia issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully through dialogue and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks
8980932 i am sure that the united position of the sco member states will have international resonance
8980933 it is well known who helped georgian authorities and even encouraged them in pursuit of their own mercenary aims
8980934 the active role of russia in assisting in peace and cooperation in the region

8980944 if we get to january 9 without reaching an agreement that would end the state of schism then we would certainly be heading to a new chapter of conflict that will be more tragic
8980945 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
8980946 ultimately we have confidence that theyll be able to conduct their review within that time period and allow us to move forward
8980947 everything i need to know i learned on the basketball court
8980948 thats certainly my view and thats why im not intending to break those commitments ive made
8980949 we offered a sovereign risk agreement to gunns to be extended to a drop dead date of november 30 and i stand by that commitment it will not be extended beyond that date
8980950 i will be in the weeks leading up to that date asking ft for good commercial reasons why they would consider extending the wood supply agreement
8980951 clarify that the wood supply agreement will remain on foot
8980952 afford to have one in five young people not contributing
8980953 it is simply unacceptable for teenagers not to have the life and work skills necessary for getting and holding a job
8980954 the government is committed to investing substantially in our schools to deliver better outcomes
8980955 but we will not be making those investments without demanding greater accountability in return i cannot understand why public institutions such as schools should not be accountable to the community that funds their salaries and running costs right now we do not have accurate comprehensive information to allow rigorous analysis of what schools and students are achieving this must change parents have a right to information to inform their familys decision making about school enrolment
8980956 walk with their feet thats exactly what the system is designed to do
8980957 can i say to the australian education union it is fighting yesterdays battles
8980958 we arent on about school systems we are on about the performance and quality of every school
8980959 a superstar like him is going to be worth anything
8980960 hes going to be worth more than both abletts and tony lockett combined because hes already a star at the beginning of his career and he looks good
8980961 theres sponsorships modelling personal appearances and media work out of season he should have deals with a car company and for clothing and footwear for a start the total with his football payments would be a million a year easy and with three or four year contracts
8980962 hes not yet a superstar in the rest of the country the way he is in victoria dare i say it he would make more if he moved to sydney or queensland
8980963 he was like a big wild colt but geez he had some talent
8980964 i told chris that this was one kid we had to sign for the draft
8980965 he didnt have a great carnival but you always knew he was something special
8980966 there are a lot of restrictions in the afl because it has existing sponsorships
8980967 hes just turned 21 this year hes got to mature hes a unique athlete but i dont want to pump him up too much
8980968 the message has come across loud and clear people want
8980969 i was never challenged when it came to acting when i was younger and i sort of just did whatever was given to me without asking questions
8980970 i didnt really understand why i enjoyed it or why i did it and i guess i wasnt quite sure about it anymore i made the decision to take acting seriously after high school when i was in my freshman year at college at nyu i took some acting classes and found that i fell in love with acting again
8980971 why are all you people so bothered that mary kate smokes can you not see how it adds to her edgy cool image she has go

8980973 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8980974 my father just literally died in my arms i notified all my kids and my lawyer notified dinas attorney lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral this will show her true colors
8980975 lindsay has been trying to meet up with him theyre both going to the mtv video music awards next month
8980976 dina took a percentage of lindsays money when i never took a red cent

8980978 when youre talking about the best athlete in the world i think it needs to be somebody thats well rounded that can do everything well
8980979 yeah all you immigrants get back home go on fuck off
8980980 im not supporting nader for president i will reluctantly vote for obama
8980981 sometimes i think she has desperate character written on her the clothes we wear send a message and i think thats the message i dont think thats her intention though
8980982 for years i tried to get producers to have vinny sell his hummer and buy a prius then i realized this show is entertainment i know that entourage is often demeaning and crude but theres also a lot of social commentary
8980983 a friend of mine a petite blond woman who works for a progressive organization was wrestled to the ground by six cops security people because she had left her credentials in her hotel room maybe the cops in denver should lay off the caffeine meth diet pills sugar cereals while theyre working the convention
8980984 as much as she does and says outrageous things and isnt the nicest person in town i think that blair is what a lot of people wish they could be shes got really good fashion and she lives in a gorgeous apartment and shes got tons of money and shes very well taken care of well coiffed has beautiful boys surrounding her all this stuff i think that a lot of women also relate to her because she is imperfect and she has her insecurities and also shes quite sexual
8980985 i made the decision to take acting seriously after high school when i was in my freshman year at college i took some acting classes and found that i fell in love with it again i was never challenged when it came to acting as a youngster i sort of just did whatever was given to me without asking questions i didnt really understand why i enjoyed it or why i did it

8981371 after the great success of the democratic convention the choice of sarah palin is surely a hail mary pass it is a real roll of the dice and shows how john mccain karl rove et al realize what a strong position the obama biden team and democrats in general are in in this election certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling i particularly look forward to the biden palin debate in missouri
8981372 is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgment it shows political panic
8981373 i do believe that mccain has to do something to reshuffle the cards shake up the establishment do something unexpected and governor palin has all the kinds of things that mccain might see as a way to shake things up i think her selection would be something similar to dan quayle dan quayle proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough now mondale tried to shake things up by going with geraldine ferraro she proved to be a disaster as a running mate and as a campaigner she was absolutely awful and so i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
8981374 in choosing governor palin senator mccain is clearly trying to shore up his past maverick reformer image an image that is now in tatters due to the type of campaign hes run and the big money lobbyists he depends on every day of the week
8981375 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero

8981447 at 44 she is younger than barack obama and is credited with reforms during her first term but she is relatively unknown in us politics
8981448 mr mccain is due to present her on stage at a rally in dayton ohio as he celebrates his 72nd birthday
8981449 analysts say the republican is keen to wrest back headlines from mr obama
8981450 ms palin is perhaps the most daring vice presidential choice for mr mccain the bbcs kim ghattas reports from dayton
8981451 and the al jazeera attitude continues to be that if its getting so many complaints from all sides it must be getting it right
8981452 the bbcs kim ghattas at the trial says the sentence is a dramatic snub to the bush administration and came after just one and a half hours of deliberation
8981453 analysts say she may have been chosen by the mccain campaign as a tactic to win over democratic women voters disappointed by the defeat of hillary clinton to barack obama
8981454 her relative youth and reforms as governor may also go some way to match mr obamas appeal and boost mr mccains chances
8981455 but ms palin lacks foreign policy experience and while being a washington outsider can be an asset for the mccain ticket it also means she has not been tested on the national stage our correspondent says
8981456 she sacked a public safety commissioner and the allegation is that she sacked him because he had not fired a state trooper who is ms palins former brother in law and who is in a custody battle with her sister

8981527 the great state of insert state is proud to be here we are the home of local high school football team the birthplace of 19 th century baseball player and senator no name politician were turning our state blue from some childrens playground in the west to big shopping mall in the east we cast two votes for senator hillary clinton and nine bazillion votes for the next president of the united states barack obama
8981528 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8981529 teacher contract impasses have declined primarily because school districts and employee organizations were prescient enough to enter into multi year agreements during a period of relatively stable prices financial markets and budgets
8981530 while it remains to be seen whether this is the calm before the storm as these long term contracts expire and new negotiations take place in the more difficult economic environment were now facing it is fair to expect that the number of disputes will be on the rise
8981531 as a group the 173 donors have been heavily engaged in the struggle for federal political influence since the last presidential election
8981532 since 2005 their political action committees executives and other employees have contributed under campaign finance law limits 180 million to federal candidates and political parties an average of over 1 million per organization
8981533 this is likely an artifact of the purely voluntary system of disclosure by convention host committees
8981534 to those who still believe in the myth of a maverick instead of the reality of a politician i say lets compare senator mccain to candidate mccain
8981535 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral candidate mccain criticizes senator mccains own climate change bill candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it let me tell you before he ever debates barack obama john mccain should finish the debate with himself
8981536 the choice is clear the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam he loves our country every bit as much as we all do as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined hsi party for more than 25 years
8981537 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more lets send a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8981538 one of my earliest memories was being in that hospital dad always at our side we not the senate were all he cared about he decided not to take the oath of office he said delaware can get another senator but my boys cant get another father
8981539 i know my father will be a great vice president as i mentioned my dad has alwys been there for me my brother and my sister everyday but because of other duties it wont be possible for me to be here this fall to stand by him the way he stood by me so i have something to ask of you be there for my dad like he was for me
8981540 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8981541 john mccain is my friend weve known each other for three decades weve traveled the world together its a friendship that goes beyond politics and the personal courage and heroism john demonstrated still amaze me but i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8981542 the choice in the election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need

8981619 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8981620 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8981621 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8981622 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8981623 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8981624 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8981625 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8981626 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8981627 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8981628 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8981629 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8981630 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8981631 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8981632 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8981633 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8981634 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8981635 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8981636 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8981637 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8981638 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8981639 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8981640 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8981641 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8981642 one way to split up the world is to divide areas of life into those that need opportunities versus those that only need effort for example imagine you are writing a book writing a book is mostly a matter of effort having a stroke of creative genius helps but ultimately finishing is about putting in the effort to write every day compare that to publishing a best selling book effort doesnt seem to matter as much anymore many authors will pour their soul into a book for years only to sell a few hundred copies while other authors can churn out best sellers in a series publishing a best seller is about having the right opportunities effort isnt the limiting factor
8981643 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8981644 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8981645 rever as negocia es e as quest es pertinentes ao status final

8981648 uma grande quantidade de pessoas desapareceu a raz o que as inunda es desta vez ocorreram em lugares onde n o havia inunda es nos ltimos 50 anos
8981649 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8981650 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8981651 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8981652 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

8981669 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8981670 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8981671 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8981672 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

8981676 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8981677 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8981678 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8981679 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8981680 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8981681 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8981682 who are open to doing something on the production side
8981683 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue

8981690 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8981691 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8981692 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8981693 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8981694 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8981695 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8981696 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8981697 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8981698 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8981699 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8981894 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8981895 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8981896 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8981897 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8981898 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza

8981917 hostilities between russia and georgia increase the risk around the south caucasus as a westward transit route for caspian oil and gas both now and over the longer term
8981918 bakus new interest in russia may stem from a desire to protect the relationship with moscow or a sense that nabucco is less likely than ever to materialize
8981919 cheneys trip will be inflammatory his rhetorical track record and known views on russia make very strident statements likely
8981920 the georgian conflict will complicate efforts to move the nabucco gas pipeline project forward particularly if the instability prompts central asian suppliers to turn to other potential export routes
8981921 europe and china are facing increasingly more demand for imported energy and they havent managed to get it from central asia and that window is now firmly closed russia has been much more successful in getting those deals tied up
8981922 political problems aside we could import gas from the middle of the next decade
8981923 there are several possibilities to fill nabucco without pumping gas through georgia

8981934 aangenaam kennis met u te maken meneer paulus ik heb al veel over u gehoord
8981935 we moeten nog maar even wachten het is allemaal zo confronterend we moeten die boodschap maar een beetje doseren die paulus is zo scherp
8981936 dat mag niet hoor de apostel paulus heeft het geschreven
8981937 ach man die is wettisch zo nauw moet je het niet nemen
8981938 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8981939 because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change
8981940 it bodes well for him as a pragmatic and wise and experienced statesman
8981941 what hes doing here is hes calling an audible when conditions on the field are changing and thats what you do if you want to win the game here one of the pieces of a solution is allowing exploration on that little 2 000 acre plot of land out of the 20 million acres up there in the coastal plain
8981942 with new technology and directional drilling and other measures that can be taken today to minimize even that footprint we know that this can be done safely and this can be managed well
8981943 and i know up here in alaska most every alaskan believes that anwr should be drilled and no one cares more about alaskas environment our lands our wildlife our fresh air our clean water than alaskans themselves and we know that this can be allowed safely cleanly ethically this type of exploration and development of an american supply of energy
8981944 its been grossly misunderstood on many fronts when you see the pictures the visuals used in the opponents message and usually this is extreme environmentalists their message as to why anwr shouldnt be touched you see pictures of mountains and rivers and beautiful green valleys thats not anwr anwr is a flat barren plain that is very very rich in resources
8981945 politics is a game where you take care of your firends
8981946 if the parties wont uphold democratic principles who will if the voters dont hold the parties accountable who will
8981947 i hope you do not give into intimidation or persuasion and remain committed to the cause this movement is no longer invisible and with that there will be effort to divide you and concur i hope for the sake of all the people you have energized you stay unified with a single voice and a single purpose of undoing the wrong lets say no deal with our votes in november and make sure the candidate who is not qualified will not be the occupant of 1600 pennsylvania avenue in 2009 long live the movement
8981948 while the just say no deal coalition respects the genuine nature of senator clinton in keeping her word to campaign with and for senator obama we will not support him now or on november 4 2008 senator clintons vote is her own our votes are our own and they will not be cast for senator obama the just say no deal coalition members will either choose to stay home in protest write in senator clintons name or vote for senator john mccain our votes are our voices and just say no deals voices are 2 million strong and growing
8981949 many clinton supporters say no and to understand their gloom one has to take into account the legacy of american womens political struggle in which long yearned for transformational change always gives way before a chorus of not now and wait your turn and in which every victory turns out to be partial or pyrrhic

8981963 the most awful thing for an upper limb reconstructive surgeon to do is to remove an arm its a dreadful thing to do
8981964 but by using the bits that would be discarded you can pluck a little bit of comfort
8981965 we are delighted tom is making a good recovery and that he is pleased with the outcome of the specialised surgery undertaken by the team here at leeds general infirmary

8981976 the people who are most committed to him tend to be principally small government traditional republicans who may well sit this election out because john mccain does not support their positions
8981977 its also the so called affirmative action programs that the government passes to say well you must make loans to certain people that want to buy houses
8981978 we need less regulation by the government but more regulation by the market
8981979 surely this is not a work of art but a blashphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that upsets many people

8981991 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8981992 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8981993 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear

8981995 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia

8982030 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8982031 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8982032 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8982033 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8982034 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8982035 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8982036 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8982037 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8982038 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8982039 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8982040 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8982041 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8982042 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8982043 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8982044 everything was going good until he started messing around on me

8982050 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8982051 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8982052 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8982053 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8982054 no one works for someone we all just work together
8982055 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8982056 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8982057 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8982058 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8982059 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8982060 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8982061 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8982062 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8982063 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed

8982069 se necesita m s acci n del gobierno de las agencias de aplicaci n de la ley para asegurar que el juicio de muchdi sea un s mbolo de todo un cambio en indonesia
8982070 pienso que una de las personas m s importantes que tienen que ser llevadas a juicio es el ex jefe de la agencia de inteligencia abdullah mahmud hendropriyono

8982073 at one point cindy playfully twirled mccains hair and said youre getting a little thin up there
8982074 mccains face reddened and he responded at least i dont plaster on the makeup like a trollop you c nt
8982075 i know hillary clinton and you madame are no hillary clinton
8982076 hey some of those voters with titties really want more titties on the ballot do we know any
8982077 at one point cindy playfully twirled mccains hair and said youre getting a little thin up there
8982078 mccains face reddened and he responded at least i dont plaster on the makeup like a trollop you c nt
8982079 i know hillary clinton and you madame are no hillary clinton
8982080 hey some of those voters with titties really want more titties on the ballot do we know any
8982081 its odd that you can get so anesthetized by your own pain or your own problem that you dont quite fully share the hell of someone close to you
8982082 it is not from the benevolence of the butcher the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner but from their regard to their own self interest we address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self love and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages
8982083 the world is flat a critical analysis of thomas friedmans new york times bestseller
8982084 globalization is the greatest reorganization of the world since the industrial revolution

8982086 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8982087 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8982088 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8982089 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8982090 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8982091 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8982092 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8982093 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8982094 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8982095 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8982096 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8982097 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8982098 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8982099 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8982100 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8982101 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8982102 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8982103 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8982104 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8982105 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8982106 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8982107 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8982108 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8982109 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8982110 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8982111 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8982112 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8982113 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8982114 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8982115 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8982116 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8982117 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8982118 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8982119 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8982120 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8982121 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8982122 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8982123 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8982124 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8982125 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8982126 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8982127 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8982128 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8982129 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

8982135 j venes maestros a n estudiantes cuya preparaci n se presenta deficitaria incompleta y cuya madurez est muy lejos de la necesaria

8982152 there is extensive debris at the site and it will take some days possibly several weeks to complete this part of the investigation
8982153 i couldnt believe the number of letters we still received that were still addressed to christopher foster
8982154 there were a lot a lot of final reminder notices and we even had people come round to the house
8982155 we had quite a job on our hands trying to prove that we werent the foster family
8982156 are projects like this the future or is it just a one off experiment that will never lead to anything else like dragons lair or those multi disk cd rom movie games of the 90s
8982157 most writers break the rules however one must first understand what the rules are so that one can make a conscious decision to break them

8982186 americans workers have suffered economically since 2003 when employees agreed to help amr stave off bankruptcy and right itself in the competitive airline industry

8982349 clearly we welcome the lifting of the ban we hope to resume work with our ngo partners in scaling up our operations

8982351 plans to deliver seeds and livestock for the next agricultural season were also put on hold
8982352 without the immediate resumption of food aid across the country widespread hunger and worsening malnutrition will be unavoidable water and sanitation services are also in dire need of support

8982354 we hope that these modalities will not involve restrictions on aid agencies or local civil society
8982355 it is vital that non governmental actors are given the space to deliver on their mandates of support to poor and vulnerable zimbabweans

8982360 if infringement is rampant right and left and anyone ought to be able to see it but you dont do anything about it then maybe you dont have
8982361 these clips on youtube are from saturday night live things that one can simply look at and say that must belong to somebody
8982362 even if the veoh decision were to be considered by other courts that case does nothing to change the fact that youtube is a business built on infringement that has failed to take reasonable measures to respect the rights of creators and content owners

8982375 stephen harper and his government have shown blatant disregard for cultural initiatives and arts initiatives and minority groups and theyre prepared to put their foot down on these groups whenever they can
8982376 this is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this government if theyre prepared now to do this on the eve of an election what are they going to do after an election especially if they get a majority government
8982377 we pride ourselves on delivering personalized patient care second to none
8982378 we believe the tone is set with the patients very first call and in a medical situation people will always be more comfortable dealing with a person thats why reaching a person right up front rather than a recorded message is so very important
8982379 and i know that on thursday night at the stadium ill cry again
8982380 something is happening in america and people are prepared and ready to make that great leap
8982381 its not even here yet but what can we do about it its like crying before you get hit
8982382 the only explanation i would have is that some gas stations anticipate being affected by the storm
8982383 you know it was going to happen because its labor day weekend
8982384 i guess i just wont spend as much and hope they start drilling our coast
8982385 its like that with chemo you have your good days and bad
8982386 i thought f because you think its never going to happen to you
8982387 its such a scary scary time but the nurses and everyone in the oncology department at kew southland hospital are amazing
8982388 i get really down sometimes but youve got to let it happen and know its okay because tomorrows another day
8982389 we see a lot of drink type incidents because queenstowns a party town but frequently we cant find out what theyve consumed because people have mixed shots with other drinks
8982390 it was sometimes like people were on acid or something it changed their personality really quickly and then others drank it and were fine
8982391 the problem occurs when people get on the absinthe and do heaps and heaps of shots
8982392 we have no thoughts of banning it here weve had no problems with it
8982393 we as parents had to watch him die twice in the ambulance and once at southland hospital before he was put on life support
8982394 its an abuse of power and they shouldnt be allowed to get away with it
8982395 doc thinks it can charge 20 000 a metre thats very expensive in anyones book
8982396 theres no relation between the amount and the effect on doc land
8982397 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
8982398 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
8982399 if auckland hit their straps they can make anything happen but if the southland forwards can get stuck into them and deny them a bit of ball theres no reason why they havent got a chance
8982400 if southland can win it and hold on to it for a while it would mean a hell of a lot to the province if they were to get it they have always been a hard side to beat down here
8982401 to take either of those two teams away is heading for disaster because they have been around for a long time and have proud histories
8982402 the new zealand rugby union doesnt seem to help itself at times rugbys taking a fair bashing from lots of areas and to do that to an area like northland with that depth of history is going to be to the detriment of the game completely
8982403 and they havent done that bloody well with them either
8982404 the dog reads you so easily it can be as little as an eye raise
8982405 heaven forbid the dog answers the phone when youre not there
8982406 you cant ask a chihuahua to turn the light on
8982407 theres no point panicking about this as we have really just got to understand what it means
8982408 do you think they are a big influence in consumer products
8982409 and what does this 21 year old do to support himself let alone a small child im not opposed to the father being in the childs life but i dont think its fair for an innocent little girl to be subjected to a life where her father has to struggle everyday to make ends meet regardless if his family is supporting him and on top of that to be pulled from the only home and family shes known just because hes her father
8982410 im sure he is because the court just awarded me oh i cant talk about it
8982411 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
8982412 adult millionaire daughter would be upset if she did not receive an expensive gift and party for her birthday
8982413 is emotionally upset by the abandonment of her father and deserves to have some kind of recognition for a young life well lived
8982414 there are guys that people dont know that ive been in love with ive had secret lovers
8982415 i dont want to talk about it but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run
8982416 i would walk down the school halls and hear people talking about me
8982417 in the dark knight id love to know who washes batmans suit or who fills up the batmobile
8982418 does it use unleaded or diesel and who patches suit when he gets a hole in it does iron man wash his own socks who fixes iron mans washing machine when it clogs
8982419 they are the things id like to know the everyday things in hellboy i try to give an every day life feeling to the characters
8982420 hellboy is a slob and knucklehead but when he has to stand up he is a hero
8982421 they are heroes in the moment you need them to be
8982422 firemen take their kids to school take out the trash and then they clock in and go to work and save lives
8982423 i thought it would be interesting to make the characters in hellboy fallible and in a mexican kind of way sit down have a few beers and sing a song
8982424 i think at the right moment every mexican listens to jose jose has a beer and tears up
8982425 theres many things i like to put into the movies i make in hollywood that go against the grain
8982426 it could be a tumour joke or singing a barry manilow song or it can be textually different
8982427 what i have learned is the less i conform the more i love the movie
8982428 the more i conform the less i empathise with the result a couple of years later
8982429 he was listening to vivaldi and mozart but we really know he was listening to barry manilow
8982430 to make a comic book fantasy this derivative yet this dazzling requires more than technique
8982431 it takes a director in touch with his inner hellboy
8982432 i really wondered in this movie if i could be a 12 year old filmmaker again
8982433 picasso said it took him 30 years to learn how to paint like a seven year old and i feel the same way
8982434 im 43 but im finally making movies straight from the zone when i was watching them when i was a kid
8982435 in the scene where they resurrect the fairy in the autopsy room i do a wide shot of everybody standing around and the little fairy moving around in the middle
8982436 the scene where the stone giant doorway raises from the ground i told creator of
8982437 i was hoping to arrive on stage riding on the back of a giant 50 foot worm made of tinsel rather like the sandworms in the film dune but apparently it was ludicrously expensive
8982438 a tinsel worm is a bit gaudier you know its a bit more cheap its down on the street not your exclusive worm its a worm of the people
8982439 im naturally more disposed now to think up things in the evening after so many years of performing its ingrained now i tend to associate evenings with having to think up jokes
8982440 tv is a different kind of buzz because its in the final process its a delayed reaction type of gig whereas standup is very immediate for shameless gratification junkies its more of a hit
8982441 its a function of comedy in a way to prick at peoples self importance its quite powerful like that it can seep through the cracks a little bit where other things cant get through
8982442 i think producers casting a film normally get agents and casting people and i just get a petition sent through it must just really annoy them
8982443 but id love to be in the hobbit it would be great what a fantastic gig ive had furry feet for years now im ready to go at a moments notice
8982444 naomi told vladimir how much she loved brazil and that she really wanted to settle down there so he bought her the apartment and said it was a gift for her
8982445 they will use it as their base when they are in brazil together
8982446 nessuno ha avuto ancora il coraggio di proporlo ad entrare alla casa bianca
8982447 how do we speak the truth in love to one another
8982448 cleaning up with children around is like shoveling during a blizzard
8982449 the moment a child is born the mother is also born she never existed before the woman existed but the mother never a mother is something absolutely new
8982450 if evolution really works how come mothers only have two hands
8982451 it was 2 in the morning or so and it seemed like johns father had been sleeping before it happened
8982452 he got to the point pretty quickly after we got moving
8982453 captain mccain was upset but he didnt go on talking about it very long
8982454 he wanted to get home he just said no more of that the important thing was that we not jeopardize anything for ourselves

8982464 quello che per vorremmo infine sapere da un ministro che annuncia di voler rivoltare la scuola e redimerla dei suoi peccati se non crede che nel pacchetto dei provvedimenti che va snocciolando un giorno s e laltro pure manchino almeno due intenzioni ben pi strutturali della riforma delle pagelle
8982465 la seconda intenzione sarebbe ridare alla scuola pubblica la sua vecchia indiscussa centralit ideologica s ideologica che tuttuno con con la sua identit sostanzialmente immutata dal regno al fascismo alla repubblica quella di cardine formativo di un popolo di uno stato di una comunit di cittadini

8982471 another valuable day in monza and we have learnt some interesting things that will help us prepare for the race here in a couple of weeks time
8982472 we tried lots of different things with the set up and then did some suspension work in the afternoon as using the curbs is important here i think we have taken the car in the right direction and we have a good basis to build on over the race weekend
8982473 serves as a device for sharply narrowing the range of policy debate
8982474 what neither of these candidates will be able to i think accomplish is to persuade us to look ourselves in the mirror to see the direction in which we are headed

8982482 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
8982483 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily

8982488 these are major engineering projects its hard to gauge whether this could have been executed faster
8982489 i think there is a concern if we get another hit of some kind that it is going to be a huge setback
8982490 we are going to face the issue of a lot of people deciding it is not worth it to stay

8982502 era casi imposible detener las bengalas cuando tocamos en obras sanitarias hab a fiscales presentes y las bengalas pasaron igual es injusto que nos imputen esto
8982503 se ten an que ocupar de que no ingresara la pirotecnia
8982504 no verificaba las instalaciones porque es el estado el que lo tiene que hacer
8982505 irracional que le digan a un m sico que tiene que controlar
8982506 yo no ten a obligaci n de inspeccionar eso no es lo que dice la ley supon amos que los funcionarios p blicos no iba a permitir que se hiciera ingresar a m s gente de la permitida

8982511 he knows what his capabilities are and he always plays inside of them hes a hard worker too hes always a guy whos pushing everybody else to do their best and hes always working to do his best as well
8982512 i think if we can get that combination right it should be an exciting year for us mail po box 359 sheboygan wi 53082 0359
8982513 its amazing how well we did the past couple of years considering how many guys we had that hated football
8982514 there were all stars on our team who absolutely hated coming to the stadium every day
8982515 coach stew treats us like men he shows us respect
8982516 you can go talk to him whenever you want if you tried to go up and have a conversation with coach rod it felt weird and uncomfortable
8982517 the deal with coach rodriguez everyone has moved on that situation is long gone
8982518 a few weeks before coach rodriguez left coach stewart and one of the former assistants who ended up leaving for michigan got into at practice
8982519 he and the other coach were really going at it the main thing i remember is that all of the players gathered around coach stew we had his back and not the other coach
8982520 that said a lot about what this team thinks of him
8982521 the biggest problem people had wasnt just that rodriguez left
8982522 it was how he left it was a tough time for everyone
8982523 hed walk in that room and sit in that chair and it was like hed been there before there was no stuttering or stammering there was a confidence about him that permeated throughout the entire room
8982524 each time i looked at billy i never sensed any fear in him that hed be unsuccessful
8982525 i never let it be shown and i never stressed it to the staff or to the team
8982526 but i knew we needed that win for this school and this state id have given my life to win that game that night
8982527 we got to arizona and in my very first press conference i said in a very serious voice we came out here to win we came out here to
8982528 quite frankly there was emotion involved itd be unrealistic to say there wasnt wed just beaten what some said was the best team in the country by 20 points it was our best victory ever and he coached it
8982529 its symbolic of the lives we lead here in this great state
8982530 west virginians are so blue collar and down to earth theyre coal miners and construction workers who put in an honest days work for an honest days pay thats how i was brought up
8982531 west virginians have a feeling and a love for one another thats like no other
8982532 its kind of us against them you know what i mean
8982533 people think were a bunch of hillbillies that live in shacks and trailers well i very proudly spent the first five years of my life in a trailer and someday when i retire ill be back in a trailer if im trailer trash im trailer trash if thats what people think it doesnt bother me
8982534 all i need is to walk into a store and see my dumb face looking back at me ive never thought coaches should be put on pedestals were not presidents or governors were teachers of young men
8982535 i like to treat people nice but this isnt some church camp
8982536 if you cant stay on sides if you have mental busts if you talk back to a coach youre in the bleachers i dont have to say anything i just point to the steps they know as soon as i point they start running
8982537 there wasnt a day on this practice field the last three years where you wouldnt hear at least 150 swear words
8982538 seriously there wasnt a day that went by when that didnt happen now its nothing like that people are having fun
8982539 it is night and day in the past even the staff was walking on eggshells around here you didnt want to do anything wrong now its much more of a laid back and relaxed atmosphere i think it will pay off come game time
8982540 i came to this thing last year when rich rodriguez spoke and he said hed be here for another 20 years
8982541 everyone hates him believe it or not there are a lot of people that think he lost that game against pittsburgh on purpose so he could go ahead and get started at michigan instead of playing in the national title game
8982542 im rooting for two things this season west virginia to win and michigan to lose
8982543 ive got friends that are going to lay down bets against michigan every game
8982544 bill stewart was in the right place at the right time now hes got to capitalize on it i think hell do it
8982545 hes still undefeated hes 1 0 so everyone is behind him
8982546 but you know how fair weather college football fans can be
8982547 but after that after pat white is gone who knows
8982548 thats when well find out what kind of coach he really is
8982549 it has to be someone that sees the big picture someone that can all of a sudden manage a staff that he was probably friends with and very close to before
8982550 theres no sure fire way to know when someone is ready to take that step i think its a feel thing
8982551 bret called me after about two weeks on the job and said you didnt tell me all of this stuff was going to happen
8982552 youve got different things coming across your desk every day that you arent prepared for different decisions you have to make theres a demand on your time all the time
8982553 a lot of assistant coaches dont see that they just know their own little world
8982554 its difficult to get a program where youre winning consistently
8982555 were at that point right now all of the things are in place for it to continue

8982595 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie

8982604 ive been in situations where ive been out there with a couple of dud games and then you get a win like that it looked good in certain ways and in others it looked crap
8982605 from where i was it was about a metre inside
8982606 when you lose a few in a row you can feel the confidence seeping from the guys when we lost our momentum last night we lost our grip and we sort of went away from our team game and that just comes with confidence a lot of the guys have been struggling
8982607 over the last couple of weeks i thought we werent getting on with our game plan and between braith and junior mitchell pearce theyd have more say in that
8982608 its hard taking it from such an inspirational player and someone whos done so much for the club but fitzy took it very well and he understands but i cant worry about it too much ive got to get on and lead the team
8982609 we might have a chicken wing tackle there but dont quote me
8982610 if i tell you guys then they match review committee will have a look at it
8982611 and were outraged by illegal warrantless wiretapping by bushist minions
8982612 this means it can spot names or numbers that crop up alongside anyone already of interest to the authorities and then catalogue any documents that contain such associates
8982613 as a tool to help the security services tackle crime and terrorism
8982614 authorized groups need to have direct access to communications between suspects whether it is individuals groups or organizations only then can they take appropriate action detect prevent and anticipate crimes and guarantee peace and security
8982615 from nontraditional sources such as public safety entities and private sector organizations
8982616 to anticipate identify prevent and or monitor criminal and terrorist activity
8982617 a vast database of names that feeds the nations terrorist watch list
8982618 would actually be less capable than the u s government terrorist tracking system it is meant to replace
8982619 the program appears to be on the brink of collapse after an estimated half billion dollars in taxpayer funding has been spent on it
8982620 technical flaws hinder terrorist watch list congress calls for investigation
8982621 recent weeks the government has fired most of the 862 private contractors from dozens of companies working on the railhead project and only a skeleton crew remains
8982622 calls to officials of boeing and sri were not immediately returned
8982623 currently there are no good patterns available to recognise terrorists he says and questions whether siemens has got around this
8982624 for a moratorium on the development of fusion technologies referring explicitly to the siemens intelligence platform
8982625 the efficiency and reliability of such tools is as yet unknown more surveillance does not necessarily lead to a higher level of societal security hence there must be a thorough examination of whether the resulting massive constraints on human rights are proportionate and justified
8982626 it just goes to show you how people will lie
8982627 whilst we may have wanted to take minmet forward with operations in new mexico the current state of the markets has rendered this entirely impossible and there was no chance of adding any value into minmet without drastically diluting our shareholders
8982628 this is therefore a fantastic deal for all our shareholders
8982629 five pastors joined the alliance including african american pastor so and so from ohio

8982631 even though eslocker apparently used a corporate credit card to release himself on bail everyone at abc is just shaking their head and chuckling
8982632 we got a kick out of the fact he swiped his corporate credit card to put up the five hundred

8982637 depending on what happens in phuket should the airport be open we will continue on to phuket tomorrow morning
8982638 were currently trying to contact all 265 passengers in phuket to ask them to stay in their hotels pending the advice of the details of the return journey
8982639 my visit gives a face to the relationship between the diocese
8982640 im here to nourish the appeal of this relationship and learn more about what our seminarians will experience
8982641 a big part of what the seminarians will learn is how to balance a secular life with a rich faith
8982642 they will bring something special to the united states and bring back something valuable to hanoi

8982645 were sitting on the sidelines not because were lazy were sitting on the sidelines because even if this category netbooks and ssds takes off and we get our piece of the pie it doesnt add up its a product that essentially has no margin
8982646 ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation
8982647 in classic evolutionary thought each of us invents our own survival strategies as we struggle against the environment
8982648 in short strategy is a term that refers to a complex web of thoughts ideas insights experiences goals expertise memories perceptions and expectations that provides general guidance for specific actions in pursuit of particular ends
8982649 systems are fluid relationships that we observe as rigid structures they are webby wandering nonlinear entangled messes
8982650 people began to shout to rise from their seats and clap and cry out a forceful wind carrying the reverends voice up into the rafters
8982651 those stories of survival and freedom and hope became our story my story the blood that had spilled was our blood the tears our tears until this black church on this bright day seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world
8982652 our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal black and more than black in chronicling our journey the stories and songs gave us a means to reclaim memories that we didnt need to feel shame about memories that all people might study and cherish and with which we could start to rebuild
8982653 the past isnt dead and buried in fact it isnt even past
8982654 with this bold and inspired selection sen mccain has verified his stated commitment to assembling a truly pro life administration
8982655 the republican ticket stands in stark contrast to the stridently pro abortion ticket put forth by the democratic party
8982656 you can be sure the vice presidential selections will have far reaching ramifications in this race
8982657 we believe land should be owned by new zealand citizens and residents only and our laws should be changed to say that we welcome ex pats coming home and people coming to this country to live but why should we allow singaporean australian or american speculators to buy investment properties in our country shutting first time home buyers from the market
8982658 i dont think there are hundreds of people just buying up new zealand we do sell houses to overseas buyers but it isnt a big deal the percentage is very minimal the people ive been dealing with recently tend to be first home buyers and people moving to hamilton from other parts of the country
8982659 the report makes it sound like new zealand is for sale but it isnt undoubtedly there is a number of overseas buyers looking after all its the only way they can look at a property looking at real estate is escapist thats why we have so much traffic people go online just to look sometimes its not like a bank website where you have to use it
8982660 on an average month our site gets around 270 000 unique visitors for the waikato in an average month around 370 000 pages are viewed about 12 000 pages viewed per day the waikato is the region of the country that has the lowest ratio of international visitors just 17 per cent the top region for international traffic is nelson bays with 39 per cent of all visitors from outside new zealand
8982661 to put it in perspective around 10 per cent of our property site traffic is international
8982662 the reality is that the clandestine lab found was a massive one
8982663 this is getting rather funny i can see very plainly that perlas not very popular with some of slashs fans someone posted that perla would stop slash from seeing his kids if they separated i very much agree with that because she just seems the type to do such a thing when the rumors about slash and perla getting divorced were going around i posted on another board that i thought she would keep the boys from him i can tell you that if the posters on that board could have gotten to me they probably would have killed me where i stood for speaking against perla all this doesnt mean that i dislike perla on the contrary i think that she is just who slash needs to keep him in line poor slash doesnt seem to have a lot of self control when it comes to being excessive they kind of remind me of ozzie and sharon osbourne if it wasnt for sharon i really believe that ozzie would have been gone a long time ago as for slash and perlas relationship i think that shes probably his rock

8982667 within three weeks of showing him a picture i had something even better sitting in my workshop for about 20 000
8982668 you get higher wages here but you will spend more and there is more tax
8982669 we had looked everywhere and the lack of apprentice training in the late 80s and 90s hadnt helped
8982670 our international staff have a wonderful work ethic and add huge value to our existing culture
8982671 they are incredibly loyal the more you give the more they give
8982672 its important to make the most of people coming here and who do want to be here
8982673 new zealand is already competing with australia advertising mining jobs in the paper
8982674 we are not a recruitment agency but our business is to help small businesses so if they cant get the right workforce then its our business
8982675 the majority of people who first come to new zealand even from england or south africa say it can be difficult to fit in with their employer it may be even things like the time of day you start work whether you are expected to go out to dinner with your boss and how you address them
8982676 it was quite hard especially for a person coming from a country with a different language
8982677 not all of the kiwis accept a person like me but i was fortunate to meet my previous boss
8982678 it cant be resurrected once its in liquidation its terminal
8982679 it means the company can no longer continue to trade effectively all the assets are frozen and come under the control of the liquidator
8982680 presumably because of the publicity surrounding this liquidation and the possibilities of fraud then its up to the liquidators to decide how much of an in depth liquidation they will do knowing there is a third party
8982681 if hes spent money hes not entitled to they may look to recover it from ken ross
8982682 unless hes a banned company director he could continue and go back into business
8982683 you would only attend if you were seeking to stop a company being liquidated
8982684 if the staff and inland revenue are owed a lot then the chances of any significant money being available to unsecured creditors are remote
8982685 from my point of view as a creditor good job
8982686 lets face it the guy mr ross has got no credibility
8982687 at the moment we wouldnt accept liability for the fire we dont believe it should be on charged to us and a legal argument would have to be sorted out in court
8982688 my understanding of it is its the total cost of the fire suppression effort including fire engines i imagine they were of a significant cost and were destroyed but i imagine they have insurance
8982689 no invoice has been given to the waikato district council and until thats the case until the council respond to that we simply dont know i would have thought that the council would have had insurers to have claimed that on anyway
8982690 as to whether the fire service tries to recoup those costs its not for me to say as we havent had those costs
8982691 its in a rural area and we are the rural fire authority
8982692 i put that figure to him and he didnt deny it
8982693 im not going to be a huge amount of help on this but id say its a touristy memento maybe of a trip to egypt possibly the early 1900s
8982694 not absolutely top of the pops but there are no cracks chips or restorations and its a rare shape and pattern
8982695 we love it were charged up were obsessed by this stuff its addictive
8982696 fed up with current government time for a change of government
8982697 weve worked very hard and been very supportive of local issues
8982698 hamilton is a reflection of nationwide polling and we national have been polling well across the country
8982699 but there is a long way to go in the election it will be a tough campaign and we will fight on the issues
8982700 weve had a relationship with them for five years and we work closely with them on trying to establish their goals and objectives
8982701 mt pirongia was crying out for a group to be set up to be community advocate if we wanted things to improve for the mountain we really needed to set up a group
8982702 its the same all over new zealand native forests are under threat from so many different pressures they need peoples interventions to protect them
8982703 mt pirongia really gets into your heart there is someone who has lived in australia for 20 years and ive been told that the first thing they think every morning about is mt pirongia
8982704 we chose that is because were not keen to use 1080
8982705 every year were protecting birds and making sure that forest health improves
8982706 you know what youve actually achieved that way and its also a motivator for your volunteers
8982707 its been really great we have enough volunteers that you dont have to have a lot of people but were always keen to hear from interested members of the public who want to get involved we can match your fitness level with the monitoring lines we have available
8982708 we have people in our group who remember hearing kokako on the mountain back in the 1980s
8982709 we went out and demi was dancing up on me and humping me from behind she was lactating at the time and she was squirting breast milk at my lesbian friends
8982710 my friend michelle called me the next morning and asked me how do i get breast milk out of my black dress
8982711 causes annoyance or inconvenience to participants in a world day event
8982712 the traditional civil and political liberties like liberty of the person and freedom of speech have independent and intrinsic weight their importance justifies an interpretation of both common law and statute which serves to protect them from unwise and ill considered interference or restriction
8982713 this is a governor who was almost impervious to error
8982714 now she could face impeachment in a worst case scenario
8982715 he speaks of how this country is better than the examples set by the consequences of the administration its true that
8982716 we need to change the idea that people cant argue respectfully this is very true today in order to effect change on the other side we have to be willing to listen as well as be heard
8982717 the new slogan is born eight is enough i appreciate sen obama always acknowledging mccains service to our country and despite him being the democratic nominee he continues to address america as a whole republicans and independents included
8982718 the comment on individual responsibility was my favorite by far i like the comment about properly equipping and caring for our troops but would prefer the mention of the word peace at least once
8982719 now this is what im talking about specifics clean water ten year plan to end our dependence on foreign oil tax cuts for small biz owners like my mother and myself domestically built energy efficient cars who could be against that
8982720 he said our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters wow bold but im definitely feeling the statement and his stance about finding a common ground when in a disagreement
8982721 oh yes i can do this i know what they want
8982722 its very exciting and makes you proud to be a new zealander
8982723 i think its really good for cambridge its amazing how many cambridge based people went
8982724 the olympics itself was great a once in a lifetime opportunity but the racing was horrible
8982725 during practice i was feeling great and beating everyone to the first corner but come race time i couldnt do it

8982729 on sunday afternoon after the rain had stopped we drove out and saw almost all of it had blown down
8982730 a northeast wind had ripped through and mystery creek is a natural wind tunnel we spent an hour and a half on sunday and a big part of monday putting it back up
8982731 i dont think people realise how extensive the set up is
8982732 around the world there are literally hundreds of millions of people watching it on television
8982733 the first year at mystery creek i spent hours and hours on it
8982734 the international safety observer comes to every event and has given it the thumbs up
8982735 i still enjoy the challenge when it all comes together and when the guys who volunteer give it their all
8982736 i love coming over the hill and looking down and seeing it all set up and when you see it running smoothly
8982737 i have a crazy pipe dream to be a journalist following the wrc around the world
8982738 i wanted to be a mechanic but my friends told me i was too smart
8982739 i wouldnt have got to this level if i was a mechanic in two years time after graduation hopefully i can work writing about motorsports going overseas
8982740 ill ask them straightforward questions how they went on the stage any particular problems they might have had with the car and how they are enjoying the stage
8982741 it takes the pressure off the drivers otherwise there are about 100 people gathered around them wanting quotes and that is not fair on them
8982742 its the technology the speed even just the smell of it and the noise this is a real stepping stone for me
8982743 my father neil is an observer in a helicopter my grandfather and former rally nz gm eric helps out in the secretariat office and my brother mark also helps out as a commentator
8982744 this is a large event and wouldnt run without the volunteers
8982745 i think my wife wants to know the answer to that one too its like anything if you are willing to put something in without needing something out of it and you enjoy it its good the buzz for me is just being there
8982746 it is about the challenge of making the system work in difficult terrain
8982747 it can be muddy rainy and dusty but you need to make sure things work and work to the best they can i come back for the challenge and the satisfaction of making it work there is always a slight variation in radio conditions
8982748 before we were expected to have the results entered within a minute and a half
8982749 now we try and beat the automated system its a challenge but sometimes we do
8982750 it is tragic that so many alaska fishermen and their families have had their lives put on hold waiting for this decision
8982751 my heart goes out to those affected especially the families of the thousands of alaskans who passed away while waiting for justice
8982752 las dificultades econ micas con realismo pero sin derrotismo y con rigor pero sin pesimismo
8982753 perfect rating from naral pro choice america etc and push hard on mccains own voting record as well as his commitment to appoint strict constructionist judges in the thomas roberts alito mold bring abortion to center stage it would be a good move morally and a good move politically
8982754 what were we thinking how did anyone ever think this was ok

8982756 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
8982757 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
8982758 i wont have religion as a litmus test or anybodys personal opinion on evolution or creationism
8982759 i wish it was time for cheers but its not its time for vengeance
8982760 i have penetrated to the wet soft white squishy but toothed heart of darkness

8982763 we are attempting to prove deliberation in a way that hasnt been tried in this state
8982764 i know theres going to be fallout but when you look at trying to bring justice johnsons not having a good time in prison hes not popular in there and he will die in there eventually
8982765 mackenzie we have no concept of final authority among us only unity we are in a of relationship not a chain of command or great chain of being as your ancestors termed it what you are seeing here is relationship without any overlay of power
8982766 for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away
8982767 closed his eyes as the tears poured out he wept until he had cried out all the darkness all the longing and all the loss until there was nothing left
8982768 the black madonna calls us to grieve the black madonna is the sorrowful mother the mother who weeps tears for the suffering in the universe the suffering in the world the brokenness of our very vulnerable hearts
8982769 what new insights or understandings about god do you discover through this image what images of god come from your reflection on womens sexuality how do you feel about these feelings insights express your experience of your sexuality
8982770 professing to be wise they became fools and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible god for an
8982771 therefore god gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity that their bodies might be dishonored among them
8982772 come make us a god who will go before us
8982773 the people themselves assume control a religious orgy has begun
8982774 and ye have done worse than your fathers for behold ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart that they may not hearken unto me
8982775 the return of the black madonna a sign of our times or how the black madonna is shaking us up for the twenty first century
8982776 the designation shaddai which some think is the oldest of the divine names in the bible occurs 48 times 31 of which are in job the traditional rendering god almighty is debated a consensus of sorts holds that shaddai is to be traced not to the hebrew but to an accadian word that means mountain so that the expression produces a meaning like el shaddai highlights gods invincible power
8982777 como no se puede amar otra cosa en el mundo

8982784 this system does affect food and livestock but its become apparent that the rfs is moving this country in the right direction
8982785 global demand for food is impacting food prices much more than ethanol is

8982787 continuing to develop renewable energy is a key component of president bushs strategy to reduce americas dependence on foreign oil
8982788 this meeting is an opportunity for business owners citizens and agricultural producers to discuss the best ways to harness the untapped renewable energy resources in rural areas
8982789 its clear that congress didnt care much about the farm bill being wto world trade organization compliant the acre program the disaster program are not wto compliant
8982790 we will go back to congress to make the appropriate changes
8982791 we will allow it to be retroactive so they dont have to worry about a signup now
8982792 weve had a particular program with russia in regard to poultry
8982793 weve removed them all from our budget congress is going to put some back in
8982794 we will not get this farm bill fully implemented before the end of this administration
8982795 could be felt as a provocation on the part of the population of alto adige 99 per cent of whom are catholic
8982796 not art but a blasphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that offends many people
8982797 injured the feelings of many people who see in the cross the symbol of the love of god and of our salvation which deserves recognition and religious devotion
8982798 not only wounds the religious feelings of many who see in the cross the symbol of the love of god but also offends the good sense and feelings of those who do not identify with the symbol
8982799 the controversy has been exploited by politicians including mr pahl for electoral reasons its true the pressure was heavy but we are an autonomous museum and we have taken our decision the work aroused a lot of argument among visitors many liked it and many disliked it but the public row was merely political and it has gone on long enough
8982800 as our summer unofficially comes to a close this labor day weekend it is unacceptable that some colorado drivers still cant understand that if you are drinking you dont drive its just that simple
8982801 we want to remind everyone to be safe and designate a sober driver or take public transportation if you plan on drinking alcohol if you are over the limit you will be under arrest
8982802 il destino mescola le carte e siamo noi a giocarle
8982803 oh yeah thats right i always get that confused with au gratin
8982804 please mr waiter id like to have the steak medium well and the potatoes with the young european caregiver sprinkled on top
8982805 sure were free to go out with you guys tonite the melted cheese and breadcrumbs are at home watching the kids
8982806 its mobile it s concealable those two things make it very dangerous
8982807 in the right place at the right time it can be very lethal
8982808 our biggest challenge is to keep it out of an area where it can do the most damage
8982809 we can look at it as an army command issue
8982810 but it really comes down to a husband and wife issue
8982811 they say if he can do it i can too it happens a lot
8982812 if theres somebody here whos friendly to her and pays attention to her guess what shes real open to an affair
8982813 youve got dummies over there who either dont care or theyre trying to get back at their wives but me man its not worth losing your rank over your moneys your money
8982814 when theyre cheating its up to them to live with it because its eventually going to come out
8982815 theyll blame the deployments and the hardships and such i personally dont buy it
8982816 i know a number of soldiers who have deployed who have not cheated and to turn around and just if thats your excuse its a crutch and its a lie
8982817 i would really be hard pressed to say that infidelity is more prevalent in the military
8982818 i do not think thats an issue i seem to run into it as much in the civilian community as in the military community
8982819 what other business what other organization provides a family support group
8982820 joe cannot afford to deploy and question whats going on at the home front he or she has to concentrate on what the mission is while deployed
8982821 its like we recruit the soldier but we re enlist the family and the family needs to know that being part of the military is not going to be harmful to their marriage
8982822 some are in uniform some are in wedding dresses and suits some are in casual clothes
8982823 we just want to get it knocked out and go celebrate
8982824 and theyre not ready financially and they dont have maturity and they dont have the emotional skills for what it takes to be committed to a marriage
8982825 persons of senior status higher ranking officers and noncommissioned officers
8982826 most of my clients are persons of substance if you will
8982827 if infidelity takes place its because theres brokenness in another part of a persons life
8982828 an affair is just a dimension of a destructive addictive behavior lets get beyond the symptom what is it that is in you thats causing you to risk a great deal and do you have any evidence that this relationship the one you left or the one youve begun has eased the pain within your heart and your soul
8982829 soldiers can compartmentalize tune out the emotion in order to do their jobs effectively
8982830 they are traits that arent necessarily good for a relationship

8983060 we got lots of stares and all kinds of looks what were we thinking but my partner and i were in a panic and didnt know what to do when we had to leave our home
8983061 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
8983062 actually what just happened wasnt technically theft it was something else

8983069 in nearly three decades cnn has never beat all three broadcast networks in viewership when competing directly
8983070 it is extraordinary for us to beat the broadcast networks
8983071 this signifies what people have known all along about where to get news
8983072 lots of shows not just news are recording all time lows because of the continued fragmentation of viewing choices and in some cases due to dvr time shifting
8983073 barack obama faced very high expectations tonight and honestly i think he met them and i honestly think he exceeded them he eloquently explained americas promise he explained why the bush cheney administration had fallen short of that i thought it was an awfully impressive performance
8983074 in many ways it was less a speech than a symphony it was a masterpiece
8983075 it was a wonderfully crafted political speech and the republicans im sure were looking in and wondering what theyre going to be able to do next week to match it
8983076 i thought it was amazing ive written speeches all my life of course nothing like this it was a great way of throwing back the other sides best shot and saying its full of crap
8983077 if anybody ever thought that barack obama was not tough enough to run against john mccain this speech should really put an end to that
8983078 i thought it was an exceedingly smart speech in which barack obama played offense and defense very effectively
8983079 i have three people who as you say have been following this for a long time two of these women are hillary clinton supporters and i wanted to ask you first

8983092 this was a very important decision for scott and we are proud to join forces with a successful team like columbia
8983093 the fact that the team is us and european based and includes top level riders from 17 countries around the globe fits our distribution and marketing strategy perfectly
8983094 the team is owned and operated by high road sports inc a group founded on the values of clean and fair sport and personal commitment they have demonstrated a leadership role in anti doping initiating an independent anti doping program managed by ace agency for cycling ethics and actively creating a culture that discourages cheating the team chooses partners and suppliers who provide the best products and have chosen scott based on the tools and technology the brand offers
8983095 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning
8983096 such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning between subliminal signals present in a given situation and choice outcomes
8983097 we reasoned that if subjects were unable to correctly perceive any difference between the masked cues then they were also unable to build conscious representations of cue outcome associations
8983098 the ventral striatum responded to subliminal cues and to visible outcomes in a manner that closely approximates our computational algorithm expressing reward expected values and prediction errors
8983099 we conclude that even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making
8983100 they will have the same marriage rights as other inmates they will be able to marry non inmates but barred from marrying other inmates in prison
8983101 for instance suppose a prisoner finds out another prisoner has money or other assets they might find themselves coerced into a marriage with a more powerful inmate who might try to lay claim to half their assets
8983102 the law requires they treat people the same so thats a good principle to have in mind when they are drafting regulations

8983105 this community is made up of 54 million americans and can significantly impact the popular vote and still most members of our community feel that they receive little attention from the presidential candidates and from the political system as a whole
8983106 our national research indicates that our unheard voice is eager to be heard on topics such as healthcare accessibility veterans issues and unemployment
8983107 we havent closed the gap in fact the gap has widened but the health of those who are most disadvantaged in life expectancy and infant mortality is at the same level as the rest of the population was eight years ago
8983108 the first thing is it is measuring and monitoring the problem we have really got as good a measure as any other country of the magnitude of the problem the fact that the government has had the courage to publish the bad news is important secondly we are taking it seriously the fact that we havent narrowed the gap means we have more work to do
8983109 toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8983110 in rich countries low socioeconomic position means poor education lack of amenities unemployment and job insecurity poor working conditions and unsafe neighbourhoods with their consequent impact on family life these all apply to the socially disadvantaged in low income countries in addition to the considerable burden of material deprivation and vulnerability to natural disasters
8983111 this looked to me like a republican convention in the sense that the staging was magnificent the choreography was magnificent the emotional tone of the speeches was largely superb
8983112 it was pageantry but it wasnt corny it wasnt the old hokey kind of americana it did seem like a parade but it found a balance it seemed serious yet it drew your eyes in
8983113 bill clinton had it with the music but this time they really got the staging and the choreography right now that sounds superficial but if you want people to pay attention to you you have to grab their eyes and their ears and this time the democrats did that
8983114 the republicans all that time have understood that is not how the mind works at all we are fundamentally driven by our emotions
8983115 if you think about what people will remember from this convention theyll remember michelle obamas speech which she did not fill with content
8983116 she dispelled the image that the right have been trying to create of her of the angry black woman with a chip on her shoulder i dont think she could have done that better to say we are just like you
8983117 theyll remember that hillary gave the best speech of her life
8983118 i dont even know if it really matters whether she wins or not
8983119 just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
8983120 i feel very wise and sage but at the same time very young
8983121 i love composing and the whole thing but i am also raising my children and enjoying it and teaching them to ride bicycles and how to read i love it i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time when they are on a ride and they are screaming and they are happy it makes me emotional cause i see they are having a real good time
8983122 oh every day theres something yesterday somebody sent me a picture of this crazy pig with a monkey face so yeah theres always something
8983123 imagine don mclean growing up in cleveland in the 70s and if he was black with a little bit of cat stevens twisted into his words and a little bit of richie havens thats the thought behind it
8983124 i was a little nervous at first to be honest with you with the subject matter and singing you make cash giving head and you use it to buy sudafed did i really want my young fans hearing me say that
8983125 theyre in the same vocal area i just apply the baritone eeyore requires a lot more air hes actually deeper in another way its a chest resonance more than anything else he never yells and he doesnt laugh neither one of them laughs optimus doesnt laugh they chuckle but they dont laugh
8983126 m night shyamalan gave me the worst advice he could have ever given me he said after
8983127 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8983128 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8983129 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8983130 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8983131 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8983132 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8983133 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8983134 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8983135 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8983136 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8983137 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8983138 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8983139 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8983140 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8983141 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8983142 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8983143 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8983144 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8983145 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8983146 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8983147 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8983148 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8983149 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8983150 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8983151 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8983152 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8983153 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8983154 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8983155 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8983156 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8983157 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8983158 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8983159 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8983160 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8983161 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8983162 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8983163 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8983164 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8983165 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8983166 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8983167 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8983168 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8983169 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8983170 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8983171 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8983172 the difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits
8983173 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8983174 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8983175 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8983176 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8983177 to deny parliament the chance to vote on our proposal to allow the public to have a real say on britains membership of the european union is an outrage
8983178 to allow a vote on a restrictive treaty referendum but deny one on the real issue of our membership of the
8983179 it is like allowing the british public to choose their mode of travel without asking whether they actually want to continue on the journey at all
8983180 both labour and the conservatives have colluded to keep this entire debate focused away from the fundamental issue of whether we want to be in or out of europe
8983181 the labour party is terrified of an open debate whilst david camerons conservatives are focusing on the sideshow of a referendum on the technical details of the lisbon treaty
8983182 this is not a green budget this is not a peoples budget this is a con trick budget that protects the rich and abandons the poor the government has bottled it on green taxes and failed to implement the necessary measures to cut child poverty
8983183 this was an opportunity to give whatever help possible to millions of stretched british families who are feeling the pinch and whose money just doesnt go as far as it used to instead we have a budget which gives only limited help to the poor but maintains special treatment for the rich
8983184 the piecemeal reforms that the chancellor is introducing to the chaotic tax credit system wont get the government anywhere near meeting its 2010 child poverty target the reality is that the governments approach has failed if we are to abolish child poverty for good we must not only increase income we must increase opportunity too these are the people most in need in our society yet after ten years and yet another budget they are still no nearer being given the true support they need
8983185 its a budget designed to fill a black hole masquerading as good for the environment green taxes should be revenue neutral they should not be treated as a wheeze to squeeze ever more money out of the british people but should instead be designed to encourage green behaviour and to cut the taxes of the most needy
8983186 but instead of a budget for the environment we have a budget driven by fiscal incompetence and political desperation why has alistair darling not had the guts to claw back the huge profits made by energy companies thanks to the emissions permits that the government has given them for free
8983187 4 5 million people still live in fuel poverty and the governments 2010 fuel poverty target has been conveniently forgotten by ministers trying to grab headlines by increasing the winter fuel payment for just one year will do nothing to help poor pensioners in the long run surely this is the time to compel all energy companies to introduce real fair social tariffs for all vulnerable people not just those on pre paid meters
8983188 the great political story of our time is the story of the vast and growing army of people who look at the two main parties and say no thanks people who like me like you want something different
8983189 tired of a system that swings like a pendulum between two establishment parties tired of the same old politicians the same old fake choices the same old feeling that nothing ever changes but this isnt a story of indifference people do care about issues climate change poverty their local school or hospital there are marches and campaigns and petitions launched every day of the week people care they just dont care about politicians so this is the end of the line for politics as usual if we want a political system that works for the future we need to start again
8983190 first lets clean up politics scandals over pay and expenses have shattered confidence thousands of voters have seen their
8983191 second lets give people the say they deserve i hold town hall meetings up and down the country every couple of weeks where i answer any question on any topic and anyone can come along i say to gordon brown and david cameron do the same today im writing to invite them to join me at any one of the town hall meetings coming up not as a media stunt but a direct conversation with people no spin no hand picked audiences no planted questions
8983192 third lets design a new political system for the 21st century it shouldnt be hammered out in secret smoke filled rooms by the powers that be i want a citizens jury of 100 people to sit in a constitutional convention with all the political parties churches civil society groups and more to look across the board and redesign the way britain is governed i wrote to david cameron and gordon brown proposing such a convention just after christmas their replies were laughable dave suggested he and i gang up on gordon and gordon sent me six pages of legalistic waffle
8983193 its still the same the establishment parties will manipulate the system to get the power they want but theyll never change it they like having power and privilege sewn up between a few chums in the westminster bubble thats why they wont do whats needed and get the money out of politics they dont see were heading for the skids if we dont act britain will end up like america where political influence is all about cash thats why i want a universal 25 000 cap on donations a real cap on spending and yes an end to big union donations and an end to offshore finance from belize
8983194 if it means walking out of parliament when the big parties collude against us i say fine if it means boycotting banquets that celebrate our relationship with dodgy regimes like vince cable did or speaking up to expose corruption like chris davies did i say so be it if it means risking court and refusing to sign up for an identity card i say bring it on and you can expect more much more of that from me
8983195 our whole international political system and britains role within it is twisted and warped by powerful people determined to promote their own interests what better example is there than iraq if there is one thing this illegal war has taught us it is this that when others choose to ride their tanks over the top of international law our government must not roll over or join in
8983196 set priorities here in britain not in the pentagon no more nods and winks to the abuse of human rights no more secretive deals to host american missile systems on british soil no more neo con wars
8983197 under labour quite simply it isnt any of those things this is a government which identifies twenty major countries of concern for human rights abuses then exports record levels of arms to nineteen of them this is a government which cancels an investigation into corrupt arms sales to saudi then rolls out the red carpet for a state visit from its king this is a prime minister who refuses to speak up on human rights abuses in china then picks up his reward in the form of special trade deals for too long vested interests have triumphed over doing whats right and its got to stop
8983198 families are overstretched things look bad for the economy schools and hospitals dont seem to be improving rapidly enough despite all the extra money and hard work by staff
8983199 labour and the tories cut people out theyre so used to being in power every few years they dont listen and they dont deliver our party is different it is a voice for people who want something different from politicians our party is full of people who are so much more than just politicians
8983200 when we promise to make britain fairer we are talking about big tax cuts for those who are struggling paid for by more taxation on those who can afford it an end to the unfair and regressive council tax and extra investment in the poorest children from their first day at pre school right through to university
8983201 when we promise a greener future for britain we have detailed plans to invest in clean energy instead of nuclear and get people out of their cars and into quality public transport
8983202 when we promise to make politicians listen to people we will introduce fairer elections in which every vote everywhere really counts and counts equally and well end the influence of big money in politics
8983203 when we promise to stand up for british freedoms we are proposing a freedom law to get the government off peoples backs and new privacy protection for our personal data we wont just be fair weather defenders of civil liberties when it is convenient or provides a good tv stunt
8983204 so make it happen isnt just a dry shopping list of policies it is a fundamental statement about how we liberal democrats believe in different things and how we do things differently from the other two tired old parties
8983205 the proposals in this document offer people individuals families and communities the power to make a better life for themselves we know that if we want britain to be fairer we are the only ones who will make it happen labour cant the tories wont we can and we will
8983206 the liberal democrat proposals will help families into homes that they can afford in communities that are sustainable
8983207 dead millionaires are at the heart of the tory core vote strategy
8983208 we will all need to work hard focus our collective efforts and get our messages out to voters
8983209 it is essential that children with particular needs are supported by teachers who have been trained to give them the specialist support they need
8983210 to abduction or kidnap which is illegal under international law
8983211 im not running for president to get in your way
8983212 i looked for a running mate who would help me shake up washington
8983213 i said no to congress on the bridge to nowhere cuz if we wanted it wed do it ourselves
8983214 americans expect us to seek public office and to serve for the right reason which is to challenge the status quo and to serve the common good we are expected to govern with integrity
8983215 since the days of the pharaohs in ancient egypt the occult has entangled in its web the black arts of espionage subversion and revolution
8983216 today it still affects politics participants in the occult conspiracy play their sometimes sinister games with the lives of millions of ordinary men and women
8983217 ive been researching the links between secret societies politics and the occult all of my adult life
8983218 i started writing in 1975 and since then i have written 24 books on the runes witchcraft magic herbalism folklore and occult para politics ive written numerous articles for occult and pagan magazines and since 1976 ive edited and published my own magazine on witchcraft and folklore called the cauldron
8983219 i have no plans to publish any further books on this subject
8983220 im currently writing a series of three books on historical witchcraft in england wales and scotland for three hands press in the usa on modern traditional witchcraft for thoth publications uk and a history of modern wicca for another well known american publisher
8983221 ms kardashian is a patriot whom i deeply respect and a good friend i like big butts and i cannot lie
8983222 the information which was given was from the same individual who had given information for the 2000 search
8983223 so he has literally led our family up the garden path concerning the recovery of seamuss body
8983224 he has wasted forensic experts time their energy money and he has wasted 23 years of our lives waiting for this moment
8983225 the general feeling amongst the businesses and a vast number of attendees is that we no longer have a manchester pride that is an annual celebration of the lgbt community and the gay village
8983226 who work together to promote protect and develop the area
8983227 what could and should be a community driven event is now a purely commercial operation with absolutely no regard or thought given to the community itself
8983228 established gay village operators are shunned and overlooked for non entity non gay organisations that just have bigger purses
8983229 the corporate face and commerciality of pride is blatantly and forcibly enforced over and above the community and its participants
8983230 an open transparent and fair debate on where we go from here
8983231 the festival only finished on monday but we already know that it was a huge success both as an event and as a fundraising endeavour which after all is at the very heart of what manchester pride is all about
8983232 of course individuals will have different opinions about the organisation and execution of manchester pride and they are welcome to raise them with us
8983233 as one of our key stakeholders we very much value the dialogue we have with the village business association
8983234 indeed their chairman is represented on the board of manchester pride and there are two other owners of businesses within the village also on the board
8983235 whilst phil burke is clearly unhappy with aspects of this years event he is expressing that opinion as an individual not on behalf of the village business association
8983236 many of the businesses in the village have already told us how happy they are with this years event
8983237 we consult with the village business association early in the planning process of the event and we look forward to continuing that healthy dialogue early in the planning process of manchester pride 2009
8983238 pride is losing touch with what it was originally meant to be
8983239 the event is meant to be a celebration of our sexuality
8983240 a ticket charge means that young people and other underrepresented groups cant get into pride
8983241 it seems to be very one sided and rarely do we see trans bme black and multi ethnic or young people there

8983244 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8983245 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8983246 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8983247 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8983248 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8983249 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8983250 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8983251 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8983252 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8983253 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8983254 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8983255 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8983256 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8983257 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8983258 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8983259 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

8983264 the series we did on branding your wedding was one of my favorites i enjoyed this post in particular because we were able to take our readers through the thought process of planning a weddings details and themes in one post something that not only portrayed what we thought was inspirational but also was practical and truly helpful to our readers
8983265 i am smitten with this post the darling couple with the lemony yellow colors the banjo musicians and especially with the photographer jose villa one of americas top 10 wedding photographers i love the crisp clean yellow paired with gentle moss and i love the crafty little details they snuck in making the wedding so completely unique and whimsical

8983268 i have always been driven to the desert i think the landscape itself influences people in a certain way
8983269 we experienced the desert and the sun and the extreme cold in the desert to the nonstop rain in oregon i think the weather and the landscape also influences the character
8983270 this is the exploration of the mystery of a woman called sylvia who has an emotional journey that takes her to the extremes it explores what makes her so damaged
8983271 you should ask people that question why are people so flawed because thats who we are
8983272 why is it when you watch a film and something happens that moves you it either moves you to tears or gives a chill down your spine its because we can see ourselves in that moment
8983273 there is something about kim theres a strength with her leftover vulnerability from her 20s thats just unbelievably beautiful to watch there are moments on the screen when shes shaking her entire body is shaking for real you couldnt act that

8983277 typically what youre trying to do is get the product from the wellhead to the wheel in the most cost effective manner
8983278 so if you produce it in the gulf of mexico and can get it to the wheel of a driver in texas thats much closer than producing it in the gulf and getting it to the wheel of someone in china
8983279 it looked like it was purposeful it was going very fast i dont know if he the driver fell asleep but there were no brakes
8983280 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
8983281 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do
8983282 i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time
8983283 looking forward to doing a lot of great things i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion
8983284 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much
8983285 our little room looked very bare at first with nothing on the walls

8983290 i saw obamas speech tonight at the democratic convention in denver as a political masterpiece as i had a chance to say on cnn a few moments ago it was in many ways less a speech than a symphony i also sensed that we saw tonight an obama who is growing into a new more mature leader stronger tougher harder hitting

8983292 the aircraft was on a non scheduled flight from moosonee to nemiscan settlement the pilot stated that he used the rear fuel tanks for take off and cruise and that they contained about 150 gallons of fuel with about 10 15 gallons in each of the front tanks the power settings used for the flight were about 28 inches manifold pressure and 2050 rpm with automatic lean mixture about 50 minutes after take off the left engine fuel pressure dropped to zero and the engine failed the booster pumps were switched on and the tank selections were changed without effect at this time the right engine fuel pressure dropped to zero and the engine failed attempts to re start were unsuccessful and when the aircraft was 200 ft above the ground the pilot realized he could not reach the rupert river a forced landing was made into trees about 1000 ft from the river with the undercarriage down both pilots were severely injured

8983297 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone to all the media in the world
8983298 it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again and wanting things to change even though people have said some people will forever remain the same
8983299 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8983300 his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it samantha has not and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful
8983301 i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction i was angry when i first read his attack on me but i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him

8983305 august is going out with a bang for the energy markets as gustav rolls in and hanna and her sisters are following right behind
8983306 cyclone activity is really ramping up and all along the gulf coast the storm watch is in full gear
8983307 if gustav does damage to refining or drilling facilities then all bets are off as to how high gasoline and heating oil could go but the most incredible spike could be left for natural gas which is already at bargain basement levels
8983308 a potentially disastrous storm similar to hurricane katrina could damage oil and gas production facilities in the region causing very significant supply disruptions
8983309 projected to move up the florida coastline and remain weak so those who were short over the weekend got clobbered by the shift in direction
8983310 traders are reluctantly unwilling to risk being caught short during the weekend as gustav approaches
8983311 one of the most devastating natural disasters in united states history
8983312 its looking like most of the gulf of mexico production should start getting shut in over the coming two days
8983313 if we have a direct hit on some infrastructure in louisiana or texas its going to take days to recognize the longer term impacts of the storm on the market
8983314 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
8983315 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
8983316 i am having a love affair with striker he and todd are the best duo on tv today
8983317 how can some aspects of the show be so consistently brilliant and other aspects be completely terrible
8983318 this shawn michaels chris jericho feud is borderline unwatchable i get it they hate each other just fight already
8983319 its becoming time to give some credit to the in ring efforts of mark henry
8983320 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
8983321 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise

8983324 not sure if this is or is not the norm but i just received my brand new iphone here in the uk and once it had been activated on itunes i found that the home screen the screen you can personalize with a photo already had a photo set against it it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this
8983325 suppliers may not use any form of forced bonded indentured or prison labor
8983326 we found no instances of forced overtime and employees confirmed in interviews that they could decline overtime requests without penalty
8983327 we did however find that employees worked longer hours than permitted by our code of conduct which limits normal workweeks to 60 hours and requires at least one day off each week
8983328 these buildings were converted by the supplier during a period of rapid growth and have served as interim housing
8983329 two of the dormitories originally built as factories now contain a large number of beds and lockers in an open space and from our perspective felt too impersonal
8983330 i wanted to have come forward and make this public sooner but unfortunately because of certain business relationships i could not do that
8983331 what i did was wrong and i am going to be punished by
8983332 the reason why i created these accounts was because i enjoy anonymity when playing smaller and am very prideful in what i do
8983333 the past two years i have made a lot of money playing poker this year i have been breakeven for me its correct to play smaller when things arent going well i am smart enough to move down when things arent going well i was just too prideful to make it public
8983334 i hope that people can look to me and not only learn about poker and bankroll management but also how to do the right thing and be a good person
8983335 poker isnt about luck or how you are running its about the work and effort that you put into it i have not had good results this year because of my poor play and lack of focus not because i have run below expectation i want to prove that to everyone
8983336 partially but i think the main reason was i felt like playing 25 50 and 50 100 stakes meant that i wasnt a good poker player
8983337 discuss the situation and right thing to do with all parties involved before i made any statement that was only fair to full tilt and cardrunners
8983338 the punishment is the remove of benefits he personally discarded during the time of his infraction
8983339 yes i do care i embarrassed not only myself but my company
8983340 no i would not have been forth coming i was naive and thought this would all blow over
8983341 i will argue that a donation to e g habitat for humanity does good for a lot of people much more so than the donor
8983342 i think we can agree that cardrunners was harmed by his actions
8983343 we the cardrunners managers felt that we needed to convey a clear message that we didnt approve of what he had done we considered a straight fine loss of normal company distributions but ultimately chose the charitable donation instead the fine is being debited from brians distributions but will be sent to a still to be decided charity
8983344 we feel corbetts observations and insights could make a positive contribution to our blog posts

8983360 ora la russia ha messo tutto quella al rischio perch la russia non pu comportarsi simultaneamente come il soviet unione verso i suoi vicini come se fosse lanno 1968 ed atto come se sia 2008 quando viene al wto

8983550 its a historic day for australia in the sense that a very significant international picture by the greatest artist of the 20th century was sold at an australian auction for a record price
8983551 im used to surviving in tough times as well as good times
8983552 then clearly our group is very well prepared to deal with those inquiries
8983553 we have the utmost respect for the operations of the accc and we are very chastened in the event that would occur
8983554 i have listened carefully to the criticism of my detractors and realise that as the leading australian art auction house there will always be those who seek to bring mab down hoping thereby to overtake it
8983555 i wanted to see the atmosphere and record what had occurred
8983556 i thought the three participants this week faced up bravely to the changes in demand
8983557 i think all will have to change strategy and structure if theyre going to continue to play the game in the future
8983558 we were very successful with the picasso and we will be advertising the major international works we have in this forthcoming sale extensively overseas
8983559 we will want to appeal to the national and the international market so its appropriate that theres a mix of international product at the top end as well as national product at the top end
8983560 im sure sothebys will be perfectly placed to counter that initiative by simply moving product from new york to here or london to here as we will be doing
8983561 this is a very important strategy i believe it will be necessary for competition in australia by auction houses in future
8983562 one of the paradigms that will happen is that there will be a far greater volume of pictures that will be consigned under guarantee rather than just consigned and in my view that will serve to have a far greater conservatism come into pricing because theres a limit to anyones economic resources who is guaranteeing pictures and given that our policy is to guarantee pictures at the low estimate or below this could hardly be interpreted by anybody as being inflationary
8983563 property taxes are sky high and home foreclosures are way up

8983590 if you think about fed policy frequently one of the major inputs is inflationary concerns and if you think about investing in commodities they often serve as an inflation hedge
8983591 when theres considerable uncertainty around inflation thats when the fed tends to initiate a restrictive policy stance and those periods of time are when the stock market tends to do poorly
8983592 during expansive monetary periods youre paying for that risk reduction by giving up a significant amount of return and during restrictive monetary periods youre able to increase returns significantly and reduce risk considerably
8983593 so you get the best of both worlds during restrictive conditions
8983594 the benefits of commodity futures may be understated because existing commodities indexes are not designed to measure investment benefits
8983595 those indexes include all the commodities whether they make sense in an investment portfolio or not because their weighting scheme isnt designed to capture that we would use monetary conditions as an input into the modeling approach

8983898 achieving each project will be a milestone in itself so the added bonus of retention of public access and the enhancement of recreation amenity is a real bonus for the community
8983899 if i can teach pole dancing to people in gore i can teach it to people in dunedin
8983900 i thought if i could do well there i could do well anywhere so here i am
8983901 it is a great form of exercise fantastic for toning your body and gaining flexibility and it also helps with peoples self confidence
8983902 people do it for all sorts of reasons some do it to dance for their man at home some do it for exercise it is a good laugh
8983903 a couple of men even called i didnt get that in gore
8983904 these politicians seem to have forgotten that it is agriculture that is laying new zealands golden egg
8983905 our farming communities are working very hard every day to produce the food and fibre that we sell to the world that helps pay many of new zealands bills
8983906 if we want to try and remain a first world rather than a third world country the simple fact is we need agriculture to prosper and grow
8983907 if there is a bright side its not obvious right now
8983908 the government has also agreed to support work which would help reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions in the broader agriculture sector prior to entry into the scheme
8983909 we received a lot of feedback that many people are concerned the legislation provides no protection for areas of significant biodiversity such as tussock and regenerating native forest which might be converted to pines in order to earn credits
8983910 it is likely this proposed landscaping and excavation will give an impression of this part of the reserve belonging to a private development
8983911 level of discomfort with the level of development on the edge of town
8983912 i am sad to be leaving the hospital it has been my privilege to lead this outstanding dunedin icon
8983913 the order remains financially viable and this payout will make no difference to our overall profitability
8983914 neither the registrar nor the securities commission has expressed any concern about the affairs of the order with each simply asking for information to enable it to respond to the matters raised
8983915 the actuary an investment risk specialist advised of some calculation errors he made
8983916 however it creates no problems for the order in meeting its ongoing obligations
8983917 all i can say is that we expect to receive the information requested
8983918 but even for free the risk was too high for various reasons
8983919 council needs to be careful what support it provides as a consenting authority
8983920 he was conscious after the crash we tried to get him to sit down
8983921 then a couple of girls came up and put him in a hold and he tried to hop back in the car
8983922 he was breathing it was laboured breathing he was not moving
8983923 the point i would like to make is youve got to be an octogenarian in order to write that book you have to have 60 years of experience and you still have to have your marbles
8983924 looking back over my 60 plus years of skiing provides a wonderful vista that simple challenging life has gone forever but we are all the hardier and richer for it
8983925 if she said she didnt like it i accepted it
8983926 when the economy bounces back well be ready for it with a fresh look a well assembled team and a head start on the competition
8983927 if you had said i would be doing this six months ago i wouldnt have believed you because i was lying in hospital being tube fed with tubes up my nose and everywhere it was horrible
8983928 but i think it is really important to do things like this after you have been through such an awful tragedy
8983929 in a way i was really really lucky but i hate talking about it
8983930 i wheeled in and felt reluctant to be part of it but it took about a day and i was absolutely loving it
8983931 there are neat volunteers at cardrona who all want to help i had no idea but they have 50 volunteers who give up their day to ski with you all day which is quite neat
8983932 you cant be in a bad mood up there when it is a beautiful day i am just blown away by the programme
8983933 i had no idea it would interest me but thats when mary lee got talking to me and said i had to come back and meet canadian paralympian colette bourgonje she phoned when colette arrived and we came back
8983934 skiing is neat you just meet people from all over the place i have been a skier beforehand but i think the reason why i love doing cross country skiing is because i used to be a runner and it is something i can do on my own or with a friend
8983935 it is a nice feeling to be all tired and hungry at the end and it is hard to find something that feels like good exercise for people who are that way inclined it is a way to get back into it
8983936 and you dont have to be a skier either its just about enjoying being outside and getting out and meeting people
8983937 going to the gym and swimming are not quite the same but after doing a big cross country ski it is nice to feel really exhausted
8983938 cities are starting to add more and more fees and where does that stop
8983939 there ought to be a way to find stormwater money for maintenance and improvement in the existing budget
8983940 the purpose of this is to create a dedicating funding group
8983941 these are vulnerable areas when it comes to the budget theyre very very easy to pull out of the budget
8983942 i personally am questioning why we even have to add a fee at all
8983943 if cycling is going to be part of the process towards sustainable transport and health targets that is a very mild target
8983944 the government is making the right noises but not making the commitment
8983945 i dont think funds made available for cycle specific work reflect the proportion of cyclists on the road
8983946 it would be nice to have unlimited funds we do our damnedest to work with what we can
8983947 the majority of our members are mums and dads who want to cycle with their kids but they dont because it is too dangerous
8983948 if the council is genuine about trying to get people on bikes and be more user friendly they need to up their rating as far as street sweeping goes
8983949 for somebody new to the sport if they keep getting punctures its not going to take them long to hang up their bike
8983950 many drivers behave really well around cyclists but a significant minority are aggressive intolerant and generally contribute to a sense of unpleasantness
8983951 if more people are going to take to their bikes there has to be a change of attitude towards cyclists and a recognition cyclists contribute to better conditions for car drivers every person on a bike is not in a car
8983952 there are a lot of near misses a lot of the time motorists are not even aware anything has happened because they havent seen the cyclist
8983953 these facts back up the idea that cycling is not dangerous and we should not talk about the dangers of cycling we should talk about the dangers of motorists
8983954 are you out of your mind that dress makes you look slim and sexy
8983955 no you look fat in everything you just stood in front of a mirror for hours then asked me how you look my answer you look like what youve been staring at for the past few hours
8983956 i shall dream of a world where crapatacularone is more than just a human search engine or a free online spell checker
8983957 i shall dream of a world where crapatacularone is more than just a human search engine or a free online spell checker
8983958 are you out of your mind that dress makes you look slim and sexy
8983959 no you look fat in everything you just stood in front of a mirror for hours then asked me how you look my answer you look like what youve been staring at for the past few hours
8983960 it is to be hoped that the sfo will address their matters expeditiously
8983961 mr peters is offering his total co operation to the sfo and the first meeting between his lawyers including peter williams qc and the office will take place tomorrow morning
8983962 mr peters has been thinking very carefully about this its been clear to me this would be the appropriate course of action but there hasnt had to be a lengthy argument about this at all its accepted this is totally proper and there are precedents for it
8983963 were watched by more americans than any event in u s television history
8983964 i hadnt realised that mckinnon had recently been diagnosed as autistic that puts a whole new complexion on the case but i dont suppose it will prevent the extradition or stop us prosecutors attempting to make an example of him
8983965 the european court of human rights has cleared the way for the extradition of a british man who allegedly hacked into secret u s military computers his lawyer said thursday
8983966 he is terrified by the prospect of going to america
8983967 the recording industrys proposal for retrospective extension is effectively a tax on the british music buying public to benefit the copyright holders of a tiny proportion of sound recordings
8983968 if the european commission wishes to support european artists there are many possible measures that would not result in monopolising the back catalogue of recorded music for another 45 years
8983969 i have avoided commenting on the eus proposed 45 year extension for sound recordings because the effort is so clearly wrong so clearly another example of politicians ignoring the public interest in favor of hobnobbing with in this case aged stars that there is nothing constructive to say term extension will benefit a very few a great deal and most not at all the public will suffer as it always has done but because the suffering is suffered in small amounts and diffusely politicians are spared confronting directly the ugly consequences of their failure to act in the public interest but yesterday a succinct letter on the topic was published in the times online by a number of european scholars
8983970 the main economic benefit from copyright protection is to give an author an incentive to create new works
8983971 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8983972 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8983973 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8983974 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8983975 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8983976 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8983977 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8983978 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8983979 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8983980 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8983981 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8983982 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8983983 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
8983984 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8983985 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8983986 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read y our speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
8983987 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8983988 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
8983989 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8983990 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8983991 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8983992 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8983993 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8983994 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8983995 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8983996 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8983997 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8983998 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8983999 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8984000 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8984001 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8984002 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8984003 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8984004 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8984005 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8984006 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8984007 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8984008 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8984009 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8984010 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8984011 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8984012 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8984013 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8984014 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8984015 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8984016 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8984017 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8984018 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8984019 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8984020 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
8984021 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had
8984022 we rushed four every time but what youre going to do is youre going to keep everything in front of you and tackle they probably had about 350 yards of total offense to that point then we knew we would let them throw underneath that was part of the plan
8984023 first of all i have to say i cant believe i do this for living
8984024 we didnt make an abundance of them we made some and they didnt make any so thats the difference
8984025 we just have to start stepping up and make plays for them
8984026 our confidence level for our defense is high just like it is for our offense
8984027 they made big plays today and really stepped up a lot of people doubted the defense but weve still got at least 12 games left hopefully this defense is going to make plays
8984028 we leaned on him a little bit at the end when we were struggling
8984029 i dont really want to do that but youve got to do what it takes to win
8984030 told me when i was going out there that they were going to put the ball in my hands and thats how i like it
8984031 the idea that we were the seemed so idiotic to us we did not think a debunking of the rumour was necessary so we did the opposite and began to tease the believers by doing stupid stuff like hiding lyrics about our page and adding a photo of their beloved rock star dave grohl
8984032 even with these little surprises scattered around the evidence that pointed to us not being was very strong
8984033 at leeds festival we received a few bottles and chants but nothing that surprised us however the crowd at reading festival was completely insane we did not abandon the stage as some people report but played our set minus two songs finishing at the point my guitar had been knocked out of tune for the third time my best mate had been hit in the head with a battery and kate our singer had been hit with a full can of cider
8984034 what surprised us at reading was that it was not like playing to pissed off foo fighters football hooligans poured as much pre meditated abuse and hatred up on us as was possible
8984035 the perception is that everything has changed ive heard people say that hes trying to change the culture and thats not true at all
8984036 im embracing the culture are we running a new system as far as plays and maybe some different training methods sure
8984037 were still going to sing hail to the victors after games if we win
8984038 youre going to see the winged helmet running out of the spread its crazy
8984039 we have absolutely no idea what to expect from michigan this season especially on offense which makes this one of the most interesting seasons in my lifetime
8984040 its going to be so cool to see a michigan team running the spread it might take a few seasons but hes building a program that can compete with the sec and usc for the national title and especially a program that can beat ohio state i dont care that hes an outsider we probably needed an outsider to move the program in the right direction
8984041 one night in cedar point was all we could scrounge together we brought some bologna put it in the cooler but we had a good time on the demon drop
8984042 were going to be who are im a small town guy who cut my teeth coaching small college football
8984043 i havent asked what it was like before because i dont care my door is always open players never have an appointment to see the coach i want to have a bunch of coaches who like what theyre doing and crack a few jokes and have some fun i know its serious business but its not life and death no one likes winning more than me i can promise you that but there are things more important and thats why i have such a great job i get paid really good for doing a job thats a lot of fun
8984044 those who thought lloyd carr was too boring are psyched but with everything that happened this summer the traditional michigan fan is very very skittish
8984045 the impression that some people have is that hes not going to be on the up and up and now michigan could be like every other program
8984046 all the tough stuff is behind us and he can focus now on the program
8984047 sometimes its just heat of the moment if he sees something good he cusses if he sees something bad he cusses but you know when its good and bad hes just excited
8984048 do i curse at practice some too much yeah at times but im a lot better than i used to be i used to be worse
8984049 rodriguez is a young bo schembechler with a southern accent
8984050 usually we can watch film back to 96 on michigan and its the same stuff the same ideas
8984051 now youre just going to have a certain number of games to watch them on its a bigger challenge it makes the battle more exciting
8984052 it was just time for change because everyone kind of knew exactly what we were going to do
8984053 but that was the arrogance of being at michigan you know what they are going to run its up to you to stop them because our players are better than you
8984054 the player shot his rival from just two metres despite seeing that he was not wearing any kind of protective mask
8984055 forensic examination and testing of the coachs mechanics including its braking system will be carried out as we try to establish the cause of the collision
8984056 this is complex detailed work which is anticipated to take some time
8984057 a ship at harbor is safe but thats not why its built
8984058 only one man in this race has actually fought for america and that man is john mccain

8984063 there are hundreds of work from home web sites and every one asks for hard earned cash i tried many so called get rich quick programs and what i found is a lot of investment with rarely any return
8984064 all the programs i tried had a basic concept but not the final piece of the puzzle with a lot of research and trial and error i created beginmakingcashonline com an internet marketing program like no other
8984065 the truth is i had an okay job but i was still living paycheck to paycheck and felt the need for something different
8984066 with beginmakingcashonline com you wont be a millionaire in three months that kind of promise is a scam however with this program users can create a business that will net them a steady rising income that can bring them to financial freedom

8984199 but perhaps you may still be in the same humour of not believing me in earnest you may continue to tell me i affect to be paradoxical in commending a conversation as advantageous to reason which ended in such a total uncertainty of what reason had seemingly so well established
8984200 i have been considering my friend what your fancy was to express such a surprize as you did the other day when i happend to speak to you in commendation of raillery was it possible you shoud suppose me so grave a man as to dislike all conversation of 60 this kind or were you afraid i shoud not stand the trial if you put me to it by making the experiment in my own case i must confess you had reason enough for your caution if you coud imagine me at the bottom so true a zealot as not to bear the least raillery on my own opinions tis the case i know with many whatever they think grave or solemn they suppose must never be treated out of a grave and solemn way tho what another thinks so they can be contented to treat otherwise and are forward to try the edge of ridicule against any opinions besides their own the question is whether this be fair or no and whether it be not just and reasonable to make as free with our own opinions as with those of other people

8984207 some kind of obligation or sense of responsibility i guess
8984208 you have no more obligation to chris than you do to any of your other friends who might ask about us
8984209 he has no special place in your life any more he is in the same category as the rest of your ex partners
8984210 he practically ran my life for two years ive always looked up to him and listened to him ive never had to draw boundaries and say this is mine you dont get to interfere
8984211 unless you want to continue to engage in this type of drama with him maybe you need to figure out where your boundaries are he doesnt get a say any more because you decided he didnt back in june
8984212 i guess its just such a change from the way things used to be and i feel like im still seeking his approval wanting to do things right
8984213 of course because thats what your whole relationship was based on do you feel like you got his approval when you talked
8984214 no but it certainly felt like i was trying trying to explain myself and prove that i have made positive changes and that i understand what im doing and that im not repeating my bad habits from before i knew him i felt like i was trying to prove that i am who he wanted me to be

8984420 i will continue to fight to find solutions for all investors who have been wronged
8984421 we cannot expect to provide the children of missouri with the education that they deserve without the hard work and diligence of good teachers like margaret williams

8984518 paul never expressly states that the righteousness of christ is imputed to believers the fact remains that no text in the pauline corpus speaks of justification in these terms paul does not set forth imputed righteousness but incorporated righteousness which is a shorthand way of saying that believers are justified by union with christ thus believers are justified only for the reason that they share in a corporate solidarity with the justified messiah and what is true of him is also true of gods people in pauls discussion of justification it is the terminology of being in christ which dominates

8984646 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8984647 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
8984648 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
8984649 this may have stifled efforts at developing newer and better vaccines especially for use in the elderly

8984654 the other issue i hope he will be hard with israel and force it to withdraw from the west bank and to form a palestinian state but i am sure he will not do so but im sure john mccain will not do so either
8984655 mr obama is like mr bush like all of them
8984656 no one does anything for the palestinians only for the jewish for the palestinians no one in america will do anything
8984657 one thing is that obama is connected to africa then he is close to africa and he knows a lot about africa
8984658 i think hes a great role model for afro americans and for the africans at large

8984682 im a pool of imperfections sometimes im moody i can get angry easily i listen to my music way too loud and i dont always put a good foot forward i can snap at people but of course i dont mean to i hold things off until the last minute and sometimes i just dont want to make a first move so things go undone i can be messy confusing and even a little careless at times
8984683 the whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves but wiser people so full of doubts
8984684 authorizes but does not require school districts and charter schools to offer
8984685 we think colorado is one of the best places to recruit individual coaches have states but all 13 of our coaches recruit colorado one thing about recruiting colorado kids they know the academy youve probably been on campus two or three times as a kid growing up or probably been to our football camp it makes an easier recruiting job when i go to georgia where i recruit im asked if its a boot camp
8984686 the most important thing we can do about the football program is try to keep every high school colorado player in fort collins we know this state is recruited nationally if we could get every young man in our program out of the state of colorado that would be tremendous now is that realistic maybe not but we have to try and lay the foundation here
8984687 every coach on our staff has an area a zone in colorado he has a good number of schools that he is responsible for staying in touch with and talking with coaches we try to cover every school in the state it is a big emphasis for us when we go into recruiting season if we have four weeks of recruiting we always have at least four of our coaches in colorado
8984688 weve been doing a great job recruiting down there what happens for us we might offer 16 scholarships for four positions and i think just the proximity of the front range and the familiarity with it those guys seem to commit sooner than guys from somewhere else its a good fit to be honest theyre close to home theyre the kids that stick around a little longer do better in school stuff like that
8984689 whoever comes into this state is going to recruit the same athletes as colorado
8984690 as we continue to build this program and win football games sometimes recruiting goes hand in hand we want to get the great players in the state
8984691 i just think the level of play down there in colorado has been good
8984692 i mean there were maybe 15 20 kids at northern colorado that we recruited that didnt get division i offers that went to the league nfl
8984693 did they all stay no but is aaron smith still playing after a dozen years and making 27 million or more yeah
8984694 heard about this tall basketball player at sierra high school and were the only two guys
8984695 so there are guys out there you might not get the finished product but ive always said there are a lot more division i football players than there are scholarships
8984696 anywhere you go in colorado you see kids to watch out for kids that if you were a senior and were playing against a freshman you would say this kids got potential
8984697 youre looking at a geography in texas that has so many people and so many football programs you take the mullens of the world and those types of really good programs theyre all over the place down there
8984698 all of us had played with or against each other and we looked around and said hey this could be something special if we all signed with cu
8984699 i dont want to put that on them what i do is espouse what its like to be a colorado guy playing for your hometown school thats an experience thats very unique to them
8984700 it didnt really matter whether i went in or out of state but through the whole process when i went on visits i kind of noticed how most of the students wanted to go home wanted to be home or were transferring home
8984701 so i think you kind of take staying in state for granted at first im glad that im here especially being able to go home
8984702 i talked with brian daniels former buffs guard from mullen during my recruiting and it was nice to hear the calmness in his voice about this is home for me this is why i stayed here that was just a huge relief for me
8984703 a lot of it comes down to population just numbers of kids to choose from
8984704 but i think the high school coaches in this state do a really good job
8984705 were starting to get there where the best players want to be here want to come here and have that sense of in state pride but i think that its also incumbent on us to help develop that and those relationships and make it a special experience
8984706 we think colorado is one of the best places to recruit individual coaches have states but all 13 of our coaches recruit colorado one thing about recruiting colorado kids they know the academy youve probably been on campus two or three times as a kid growing up or probably been to our football camp it makes an easier recruiting job when i go to georgia where i recruit im asked if its a boot camp
8984707 the most important thing we can do about the football program is try to keep every high school colorado player in fort collins we know this state is recruited nationally if we could get every young man in our program out of the state of colorado that would be tremendous now is that realistic maybe not but we have to try and lay the foundation here
8984708 every coach on our staff has an area a zone in colorado he has a good number of schools that he is responsible for staying in touch with and talking with coaches we try to cover every school in the state it is a big emphasis for us when we go into recruiting season if we have four weeks of recruiting we always have at least four of our coaches in colorado
8984709 weve been doing a great job recruiting down there what happens for us we might offer 16 scholarships for four positions and i think just the proximity of the front range and the familiarity with it those guys seem to commit sooner than guys from somewhere else its a good fit to be honest theyre close to home theyre the kids that stick around a little longer do better in school stuff like that
8984710 a few days ago georgias foreign ministry informed us of its decision to reduce diplomatic contacts and to cut the number of diplomats at its embassy in moscow to five people
8984711 we regret such decisions as we are confident that under the current circumstances it is essential to maintain working diplomatic contacts including for the resolution of urgent issues humanitarian consular those concerning the ordinary peoples interests
8984712 this will not be russias choice and the responsibility will rest on the georgian side
8984713 the russian position in this connection is clear we treat our partners with respect and never impose our decision
8984714 called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8984715 the opposite is true the timely and decisive actions of the russian leadership prevented the destabilization of the entire caucasus region

8984740 google looks as if its on top of the world right now holding an ever increasing lions share of the search market the way it treats its employees writes preston gralla another example google employees such as sergey solyanik have started deserting the company and its share price is down double that of the dow or nasdaq since november 2007 even if google has lost its mojo why should you care it wont make your searches any less effective will it nope but google has its eyes on bigger things than search notably your it department its looking to displace microsoft with hosted services like google apps gmail and google docs solyanik warns that googles engineers care more about the coolness of a service than about the services effectiveness

8984748 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8984749 is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
8984750 over the last two decades in the united sates even while flu vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality
8984751 further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion

8984778 sadly she could not have been more wrong because on the 23 july you made a shocking and chilling decision that would have catastrophic effects and would ruin her life forever
8984779 this was an unbelievably vicious and cruel thing to have done to another human being no matter what the motivation
8984780 i cant sleep at night i have flashbacks of him standing there doing absolutely nothing to help me there are days where i feel so low i want to end my own life
8984781 we the people in order to form a more perfect union
8984782 people began to shout to rise from their seats and clap and cry out a forceful wind carrying the reverends voice up into the rafters and in that single note hope i heard something else at the foot of that cross inside the thousands of churches across the city i imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of david and goliath moses and pharaoh the christians in the lions den ezekiels field of dry bones those stories of survival and freedom and hope became our story my story the blood that had spilled was our blood the tears our tears until this black church on this bright day seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal black and more than black in chronicling our journey the stories and songs gave us a means to reclaim memories that we didnt need to feel shame about memories that all people might study and cherish and with which we could start to rebuild
8984783 the past isnt dead and buried in fact it isnt even past
8984784 im not so sure youd want to see me eat it might not make a great first impression
8984785 office is open business as usual at least until 1pm office officially closes at 1pm some people stay longer most are not even here
8984786 yes i guess theres too much work to do and too little time to do it fridays after all are part of the work week
8984787 i had to come in today to clear the floors in my work station for a thorough end of summer cleaning that is to take place over the holiday weekend
8984788 the clothes we wear send a message and i think thats the message i dont think thats her intention though
8984789 mark was my partner my best friend my soulmate and brought great joy to all who knew him
8984790 thank you to everyone for your kind words i request that you let us grieve for him and please remember him with love
8984791 we are greatly strengthened and helped in this very difficult time by the expressions of sympathy and the kind comments about marks life and career
8984792 the history of the last hundred years has been a toxic mix of oil and war wars were funded by impossible without and usually fought over oil japans attack on pearl harbor the nazi invasion of russia iraqs invasion of kuwait and countless other conflicts have been based in whole or in part on the worlds addiction to oil even today dictators and authoritarians from venezuela to russia from sudan to north korea base their actions and their power to oppress their citizens and threaten their neighbors solely on access to or sale of oil on the world market
8984793 since the turn of the new century those hard facts have come home to america in the most vicious way attacked at home by oil funded terrorists at war abroad with oil funded insurgents threatened in global markets and faced with acquisition of our industrial base by oil funded multinationals we must defend america or face her utter destruction if we continue to follow this slippery oil slicked downward winding path our citizens will shiver in darkness as our resources hemorrhage to third world thugs whose only virtue is their control of petroleum based energy
8984794 these threats are real they are immediate and they are potentially overwhelming and the saddest part the most terrible irony is that we finance them every time we pump gas or pay utility bills

8984796 within three weeks of showing him a picture i had something even better sitting in my workshop for about 20 000
8984797 you get higher wages here but you will spend more and there is more tax
8984798 we had looked everywhere and the lack of apprentice training in the late 80s and 90s hadnt helped
8984799 our international staff have a wonderful work ethic and add huge value to our existing culture
8984800 they are incredibly loyal the more you give the more they give
8984801 its important to make the most of people coming here and who do want to be here
8984802 new zealand is already competing with australia advertising mining jobs in the paper
8984803 we are not a recruitment agency but our business is to help small businesses so if they cant get the right workforce then its our business
8984804 the majority of people who first come to new zealand even from england or south africa say it can be difficult to fit in with their employer it may be even things like the time of day you start work whether you are expected to go out to dinner with your boss and how you address them
8984805 it was quite hard especially for a person coming from a country with a different language
8984806 not all of the kiwis accept a person like me but i was fortunate to meet my previous boss
8984807 that level of uncertainty is a bit unusual and indicates that earnings have higher risk in terms of the accuracy of forecasts
8984808 the results show that the companies have done a pretty good job of guiding the market in terms of profit expectations
8984809 but all of them without exception are finding operating conditions a big surprise
8984810 if anything the new zealand economy has run stronger for longer than expected as the reporting season progressed it seems to have got better
8984811 you cannot look broadly at the new zealand market now and say that overall conditions are tough out there and therefore companies are being impacted
8984812 the outlook was not robust but it certainly gave investors comfort that the company is in a good state to withstand the downturn in the domestic economy
8984813 over the next six months the independent markets should start to decouple the synchronisation with the global shock
8984814 the flagship templeton growth fund reported a 14 5 percent average annual return from 1954 to 1992 a 10 000 investment with dividends reinvested would have grown to 2 million
8984815 the time of maximum pessimism is the best time buy and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell
8984816 the number of reported cases has been dropping since early july
8984817 there are some cases of this infection that occur every year
8984818 most persons became ill in may june and early july
8984819 if youve got salmonella saintpaul in a water supply on a farm youve got to ask the question about how it got into the water whether it was connected to canal systems the irrigation systems could have caused that contamination to go elsewhere
8984820 a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform we need in washington
8984821 she leads a state that matters to every one of us alaska has significant energy resources and she has been a leader in the fight to make america energy independent
8984822 weve got to make sure the rest of the united states doesnt believe the only thing going on in alaska is fbi probes and corruption trials
8984823 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
8984824 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
8984825 it is a real role of the dice and shows how john mccain karl rove et al realize what a strong position the obama biden team and democrats in general are in in this election
8984826 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling i particularly look forward to the biden palin debate in missouri
8984827 i do believe that mccain has to do something to reshuffle the cards shake up the establishment do something unexpected and governor palin has all the kinds of things that mccain might see as a way to shake things up
8984828 i think it would be something similar to dan quayle dan quayle proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough
8984829 and so i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
8984830 hes being looked at in cases involving stabbings and death
8984831 that seems to be the reality of it but its not the game plan
8984832 were disappointed in the way we played earlier now theres nowhere else to look and somehow weve found a way to respond to the challenge i dont know whether to laugh or cry
8984833 wir werden sicher pr fen ob das m glich ist

8984842 we are pleased with our important back to school selling period so far with high single digit same store sales in july and continued strength thus far in august
8984843 given the checkered past of delias the strong buy rating should be viewed as highly speculative as compared to much larger companies we cover
8984844 theres a whole series of our vehicles full seized trucks and some cross overs that have a heated windshield washer system
8984845 the circuit board apparently can short and normally what happens is theres smoke and the system doesnt work but in rare cases there could be a fire
8984846 in rare instances a fire can occur so we want to make sure that our customers are safe
8984847 its a very simple and fast fix and it really isnt all that inconvenient to them especially this time of year
8984848 while the physical prowess of our athletes enables the u s to lug home buckets of shiny medals our academic dexterity needs some serious sweat on your brow training

8984851 while everyone celebrates labor day we have foxwoods management repeatedly violating our rights as if it is above the law foxwoods should obey the law and sit down with us and negotiate a contract
8984852 but in norway and in saudi arabia authorities have instead focused on corralling the foreign exchange earned in the sales of energy and investing it outside their borders creating an income stream for future generations
8984853 the results for the half year are of course disappointing
8984854 while we believe the earnings guidance is likely to put some short term pressure on the stock we do not believe it should overshadow the companys longer term growth prospects which in our opinion are still quite solid

8984860 in an uncertain and challenging environment the implementation of the operational action plan we announced in july makes me confident that we will achieve our 2008 objectives
8984861 there are and there will be rumors but my priority today is to deliver on the results for 2008

8984889 the record is clear john mccain has voted with george w bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george w bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8984890 for over two decades hes subscribed to the discredited republican philosophy to give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8984891 in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it

8984894 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives

8984911 observed that the market is well supplied with current commercial oil stocks standing above their five year average the conference further noted with concern that the current price environment does not reflect market fundamentals as crude oil prices are being strongly influenced by the weakness in the us dollar rising inflation and significant flow of funds into the commodities market
8984912 i think we may have been trying to overdeliver for all audiences and casual fans
8984913 you could call us the old abc on steroids but the truth of the matter is we are a sports network and people tune into espn for a sporting event
8984914 one of the things we heard was youre trying too hard well were going to pull back we may not be 20 pounds in a 5 pound bag well give you 5 pounds in a 5 pound bag but guilty as charged i think we were trying to service too many and found we were doing too much
8984915 the good news is that they want the playbook for virtually everything else we do
8984916 the feedback that we got was that they love our coverage they want us to focus on football and that when we do that we do it really well
8984917 jaws is one of the most credible and well liked football analysts out there not just by fans but by teams and players as well
8984918 i think we were not quite aligned with tony when we brought him on the show three years ago
8984919 i think our group inherited what we were used to as the pti tony what we really didnt put our attention on was an award winning columnist who brings incredible information incredible depth incredible perspective and humor to the booth
8984920 last year in the biggest and best moments we had tony always heightened the moment
8984921 thats just the way it is its just racing i have a lot of respect for the guy and he was real fast but we cant give up points when theyre right there for us to take
8984922 i had to ask myself when i went down there in the corner should i lift and brake early and do the best i can or should i just kind of give him a little tap and see what happens so thats the way it went and thats the decision i made id do it again
8984923 thats one of those deals where i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me hes raced me that way and thats the reason it went down like that in the back of my mind all i could think about was richmond in a nationwide race when he was trying to get through the field and pile drove me
8984924 unhappy with the micromanagers at fox recutting his film the dejected filmmaker groaned
8984925 what does a guy have to do to win this championship
8984926 but it shows the determination of the group that we have and the depth of the team we would not have won the race if helio hadnt driven the wheels off it when he needed to it is a testament to the organization we will keep going and see where we end up at the end of the year
8984927 i think our approach this weekend is the same we go for broke
8984928 that is the only thing that is going to get us where we need to be
8984929 im definitely looking forward to returning because after being really quick in practice and qualifying last year we got into some trouble during the race so i feel like i definitely have some unfinished business there
8984930 its really a tough state to be of course with fuel being the price that it is
8984931 as long as we can see a return on our investment within the sport well stay within the sport if for some reason we see other marketing opportunities that get ford a better return that could change
8984932 were really making sure we focus on things that have a payback
8984933 historically weve done science projects trying to figure out some nuance of aerodynamics that doesnt fit the rules right now but that someday we may be able to apply if the rules change
8984934 now were really just focused more on things that have a tangible benefit short term or in the near to mid term on the racetrack thats the biggest change we havent narrowed our focus but weve really just shifted it
8984935 it used to be where most of the cars entered had one single sponsor for all season
8984936 you can count those on one hand now it takes multiple sponsors to get to a point where youre going to get a car fully funded
8984937 but the flip side is that nascars tv ratings have gone up through the season
8984938 as your attendance at the track goes down the viewership at home actually goes up and they do see the brand they do see the ford nameplate
8984939 i never thought id be single at this time of my life
8984940 and with that in mind i still want to work i still want to keep my hand in it
8984941 because i dont have to work 365 days of material into the year i can take some of the time off that i want
8984942 the market is conjuring up images of a replay of three years ago when katrina wreaked havoc on the refinery system in the gulf so were seeing a little spike from that
8984943 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8984944 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
8984945 who can best help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people who are counting on us
8984946 exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help us fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
8984947 apparently a large portion of the extra money provided by the rebate checks was eaten up by higher prices at the grocery store or siphoned away by higher prices at the gas pump
8984948 you have to be concerned about where we are heading
8984949 gasoline prices plummeted in august which should provide some near term relief to the inflation figures and real incomes
8984950 its the same as it was two months ago when they did the first exam
8984951 now the thing is its not better either and it seems like the only way to repair it completely is arthroscopic surgery
8984952 the team at ciao has built a passionate consumer community based on intuitive technology and extensive merchant relationships that we believe will deliver incremental benefit to the microsoft live search platform
8984953 we think the greenfield purchase would strengthen microsofts online platform and is consistent with strategy of simplifying tasks related to online transactions
8984954 we see long term benefits of increased investment but project losses in microsofts online service business for next couple of years
8984955 corsica is generally thought of as an expensive luxurious getaway especially in the south around porto vecchio and bonifacio

8984965 when we looked up at whistler mountain and saw it had gotten its first dusting of snow well we havent stopped smiling since sure theres tons going on all through the fall season with mountain biking and hiking galore plus more outdoor adventure activities than you could shake a beautifully coloured leaf at but that sugar coating of snow means ski season is fast approaching
8984966 the census report confirms the depth of employment loss its really driven by whats going on in the auto industry

8984970 the iocs target is not the athletes but the coaches who supply them with drugs
8984971 the ioc wants to actively participate in the fight against doping in greece
8984972 it is the first time the ioc requests a countrys legal authorities to investigate the criminal accountability of a trainer who doped athletes

8984977 sales could be even closer to 13 million if it werent for the gm anniversary sale which could provide a lift
8984978 but sales will still be substantially below a year ago
8984979 its not a very pretty picture for anybody right now
8984980 what that means is automakers have to be flexible enough to respond to swings in demand in the most effective manner
8984981 august seems like its coming along pretty good but its versus where the market was in may and june not comparable to where it was a year ago
8984982 but on a longer term basis the core buyer today is deferring purchases and were fully confident that theyre coming back to the market
8984983 as prices retrench and then people get used to them well see some buyers return but essentially it will just stop the decline and sales will stabilize at a lower level
8984984 its going to a couple years before we see a large scale return to the truck market
8984985 there is a risk sometimes yes particularly when its a tough battle going on and its back and forth and nobodys been able to step up
8984986 and if its been made public that at some point youre going to make a call it could hurt the football team if you dont go and make a decision

8985023 theyre still going through it every detail line by line
8985024 this is as we told the union leadership this morning our best shot
8985025 it is our best and final offer and one that we are very proud of
8985026 if you are flipping burgers at mcdonalds you would call this a great offer
8985027 but for a company that has made 13 billion in profits the last few years this is not a generous offer
8985028 we have the leverage now that the company had in 2002 and in 2005 and we are going to use it
8985029 remember thanks to you they made 13 billion dollars recently and have plenty of cash on hand they may attempt to throw just enough of this money at the contract to appeal to just one third of the membership
8985030 we believe this is the best contract offer in america this year
8985031 we believe it will probably be the best contract offer in america next year and maybe the year after
8985032 from a long term perspective work stoppages have not had a material impact on the stock price or boeings earnings power although clearly a strike would interrupt aircraft deliveries and the near term earnings outlook in the past investors have typically overlooked the near term financial implications
8985033 would further delay the production and first flight of the 787 scheduled for later this year which would clearly be a negative perhaps partially offsetting that would be some additional breathing room for suppliers to catch up on behind schedule work

8985040 they want more troops in afghanistan they want to send more support to georgia to protect the oil line there neither one says bring home the troops from iraq from the bases you know the bases are going to stay there the embassy as big as the vatican thats going to remain so their foreign policies are exactly the same

8985042 todays youth not only learn through traditional methods in the schoolroom but they also learn by using computers which are known to cause eyestrain children who require prescription lenses can greatly benefit from using photochromic lenses such as transitions r lenses which reduce ocular fatigue caused by prolonged computer use as well as automatically block 100 percent of uv radiation from the sun so the eyes are protected outdoors as well
8985043 unfortunately most people spend time carefully selecting frames that are just right for them so we regularly remind parents with the guidance of their eyecare professional to discuss which lenses are most beneficial to them as this is the aspect of eyewear that promotes quality of vision today as well as healthy sight tomorrow
8985044 in your list of back to school preparations include a visit to your eyecare professional for a comprehensive examination if your child has never had an eye exam he or she could feel afraid but there are ways to comfort your child
8985045 for example you could allow your child to observe as a family member gets an eye exam this way he or she will relax knowing that it is a routine process also if your child will need eyeglasses you can point out how fun it will be to select lenses and a frame style

8985054 a growing number of companies have been using these mandatory clauses to limit the ability of their customers to sue them if they break the law
8985055 is substantively unconscionable and therefore unenforceable to the extent that it purports to waive the right to class actions require confidentiality shorten the washington consumer protection act statute of limitations and limit availability of attorney fees
8985056 courts will not be easily deceived by attempts to unilaterally strip away consumer protections and remedies by efforts to cloak the waiver of important rights under an arbitration clause

8985107 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
8985108 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
8985109 i particularly look forward to the biden palin debate in missouri
8985110 is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency

8985132 an open content distribution system that will help end users find purchase download and install various types of content on their android powered devices

8985157 candles all it shows that we do need a big margin of safety which we havent got to guard against things like this which are totally unpredictable
8985158 the dc link is not something we could easily duplicate but we should be aware there is a possibility of total failure
8985159 theyre probably right when they say they can hold it up with stays and things like that lucky the wind wasnt blowing too
8985160 mr peters is offering his total co operation to the sfo it is to be hoped that the sfo will address these matters quickly
8985161 its been clear to me this would be the appropriate course of action but there hasnt had to be a lengthy argument about it at all
8985162 i argued that he should not stand aside but apparently there is a convention
8985163 if i were winston peters i would be extremely angry there has been a witch hunt its like the salem witch trials
8985164 its absolutely incredible its like that bernard shaw play where they say well hang him in the afternoon but well have a trial first
8985165 well see how i pull up tomorrow ive got a couple of physio appointments today and tomorrow and well go from there fingers crossed
8985166 the problem has been that i could run i just couldnt kick the force of the ball on my foot just put all the pressure through my quad and i just wasnt able to kick because its one of those injuries that can easily re occur
8985167 the coaches rob penney and john haggart gave me a break until i was 100 per cent fit and i feel that im a good 95 to 100 per cent now
8985168 we might switch current no 10 sladey colin slade back round to fullback and paul williams to the wing

8985185 o balan o claro john mccain votou no congresso com george bush 90 do tempo
8985186 o senador mccain gosta de falar de julgamento mas sinceramente o que o julgamento dele quer dizer se ele acha que george bush tinha raz o em mais de 90 dos casos
8985187 n o acho que o senador mccain desdenhe do que acontece com a vida dos americanos acho simplesmente que ele n o sabe o que acontece
8985188 n o acho que este discurso tenha ajudado em alguma coisa para convencer os indecisos

8985193 you take the blue pill the story ends you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe
8985194 we are particularly concerned at the secondary scamming that seems to be going on vultures in the shape of lawyers and consultants circling and picking the investors bones clean
8985195 if youre coming out publicly with a white knight image you really must be clear about where youre coming from what you charge chances of success and the timeframe involved
8985196 here they are with their recovery roadshow tearing up and down the country asking people to cough up 120 and then telling people their own hardship stories thats not helping thats helping themselves
8985197 time is a luxury for many of these people this kind of interference is compounding their problems its all about revenge and reparation eufa is trying to become the gatekeeper when it clearly has no right
8985198 regrettably its when people are at their most vulnerable that they believe anything these people are living a jet setters lifestyle which these gullible investors are unwittingly paying for its nothing more than exploitation for self gain
8985199 if anyone wants to suggest that im somehow making a nest egg out of this then theyre welcome to and i hope they get their jollies out of it
8985200 the message has to be understood when times are tough you need lawyers to solve the problem im not sure eufa understand this
8985201 protesting isnt going to get you anywhere the only way to get any comfort is through issuing proceedings weve recovered some money sued lawyers were suing developers weve got injunctions and weve stopped mortgage payments
8985202 legal proceedings are very expensive being part of a group makes it affordable for people who have seemingly lost everything
8985203 isnt it better having one firm one group of barristers acting rather than 10 different barristers with 10 different ideas a nuclear attack instead of a shotgun approach all we got from the government was a pathetic response saying how people should be free to go where they like
8985204 there was no one else out there lobbying on behalf of investors no one challenging a lack of progress lack of action for that matter by statutory organisations

8985213 for fans of texas high school football as a whole its a great matchup
8985214 i think the people in the community are more excited about this than anything
8985215 we better keep things in perspective our most important thing is getting better were going to put some kids in that arent ready but we have to get them ready for district this is a chance for us to get better and get some experience
8985216 when you play your first game you have a lot of question marks
8985217 you learn a lot about yourself in your first few games
8985218 everything will come together in time we just want it to be in time for this game
8985219 playing a state champion gives you the most motivation you can have

8985234 shes back in first episode michael and sara are reunited and then the gang hits the ground running because theres work to do
8985235 ive played a lot of bad guys over the past 20 years but t bag is the most complex and dangerous
8985236 people stand back and give me a lot of space when i walk through airports now
8985237 we will be standing together to take on the company and i think if anything thats what remains the same about prison break season in and season out
8985238 at its core the show is about six or seven alpha dogs shoved in a cage fighting together at each others throats but still having to work together to achieve some common goal
8985239 its really a testament to robert knepper that his character has survived through four whole seasons but t bag is a maniac a psychopath and a child killer and a rapist and yet he and the boys are still digging ditches together
8985240 this time we stand up and fight its time to take on the puppet master and really put this whole conspiracy thing to bed
8985241 oh you bet this is serious business and theres not one of those there
8985242 the cell tv will be released to the japanese market in autumn 2009
8985243 for the european market we will release it as soon as possible after japan we are planning it for the u s but the launch timing is not decided
8985244 in the future we would like to create new applications using this feature
8985245 i cant say that since this convention started i havent thought about it because i have
8985246 i want to see how close to 60 votes we can get in the senate what the committee structure is and how best i can use my time
8985247 the job i do now i think is important and what i really want to do is make a difference
8985248 the question is how can i best do that is it using the seniority i have in the senate or is it in getting out there and running for governor
8985249 youve got a governor who has raised more special interest contributions than any politician in california history and is holding five and six figure fundraisers across the street from the capitol and hes criticizing people who are trying to thwart his political agenda
8985250 i wouldnt get too excited if i was a celtic supporter
8985251 things have not materialised the way we would have liked
8985252 i thought that there might have been something but circumstances have changed unless something jumps out at you which is what happens at this time of the year
8985253 someone you asked about who was 4million a couple of months ago will be thrown at you and you will be asked if you want to take him on loan
8985254 thats what happens and you have to decide if its worth it or not
8985255 the referees have been fine they have not been a problem in the old firm games they have been absolutely fantastic
8985256 so i dont see why it has to be a problem this week
8985257 there has been a couple of decisions here and there in the old firm games but you are going to get that
8985258 big decisions for us big decisions against us but nothing that is untoward
8985259 manchester united have grown up and become better so its going to be a heck of a challenge but one we are looking forward to
8985260 reaching the last 16 is a fantastic achievement we are happy with that and if we get to that stage again we will be more than delighted i can assure you
8985261 scott has the least chance of playing jan has a better chance but we need to look at his mobility
8985262 they are both big hearted and both will want to play but i might have to stop them
8985263 it would be great to have them all fit because there is 51 goals between scott and jan
8985264 our national spirit must exude joy and pleasure and say you have done well daughter of zimbabwe we are proud of you we wish you well shes our golden girl take care of her
8985265 we are delighted to make ibrahima the clubs latest signing
8985266 he is a quality addition to the squad and comes with plenty of premier league experience having played in the top flight with reading
8985267 i have never seen governor palin speak before in my life although i have heard of her let me say that this hard core conservative has shed some happy tears during her speech this is the day that the conservative movement took back control of the gop and the day that mccain won the election she is from a small town and it shows we are blessed to have her on the ticket the other side is looking a very old tired and a little cheap
8985268 we have a high rate of alcoholism on the reservation and a majority of deaths here are related
8985269 were always looking for more money to do more things
8985270 i see people who are out walking who are in recovery
8985271 we also need to look at new community specific ways to address the problem
8985272 texas is closely following gustavs track as it approaches the gulf and we are preparing for any potential impact on our communities
8985273 i urge texans along the coast to monitor this storm closely heed warnings from their local leaders and take necessary precautions to protect their families homes and businesses
8985274 i will censor myself out of respect for jennie garth because shes friends with tori i got passages sent to me and a vast majority of it is incredibly exaggerated maybe its a difference of how i was raised i just dont believe you write personal on set experiences in a book for me when you work its almost a sacred experience whether you get along with everyone or not in 27 years of acting ive never sold out one of my cast members ever and i will stick to that
8985275 just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
8985276 i feel very wise and sage but at the same time very young
8985277 i love composing and the whole thing but i am also raising my children and enjoying it and teaching them to ride bicycles and how to read i love it i get pretty emotional when i see them having a wonderful time when they are on a ride and they are screaming and they are happy it makes me emotional cause i see they are having a real good time
8985278 who can best help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people who are counting on us
8985279 exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help us fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
8985280 no dont believe well be making it to st paul reitan finally answered
8985281 i was wondering what the hell did i do stafford said
8985282 i wont forget you little people stafford laughingly promised at a party of minnesota delegates following obamas speech
8985283 he knocked it out of the park said reitan of the speech walz delivered
8985284 he comes to a gay caucus he boldly stepped out for us tim walz should be our governor he has a fundamental understanding of whats right he gets it
8985285 ive spent my life on the issue of human rights and equality he said
8985286 its a slippery slope when we say who its ok to discriminate against
8985287 in the past these issues have been brought up only in election years to hammer a wedge between people he said
8985288 i believe in public service this is one of the most despicable laws in the country and john mccain supports it
8985289 telling people not to eat meat will have no measurable effect on global temperatures but will have a devastating effect on american and global farmers this is more in line with religious veganism complete with quasi religious dietary restrictions than with climate science
8985290 it is funny how global warming activists are targeting farmers as perpetrators of global warming emissions
8985291 for quite some time activists have told farmers that global warming legislation will benefit them via opportunities such as the siting of wind farms yet now farmers find themselves in the activists crosshairs
8985292 im proud of the many important ways that the sba helps our military veterans succeed in their business endeavors
8985293 through patriot express other lending programs government contracting and education and training we offer a full range of business services to our veterans
8985294 was not satisfied that sunrise propane or the property owners would be able to provide a solid commitment to undertake the necessary work in a timely manner the city in consultation with the moe has agreed to use its cleanup powers under the environmental protection act to ensure the site is secured and dealt with appropriately for the protection of the natural environment and to prevent any adverse effects
8985295 this is a win win agreement that provides significant benefits to fortune brands
8985296 in exchange for accelerating the end of our u s distribution agreement with absolut well receive a cash payment of 230 million were also pleased that well acquire a fast growing premium rum brand rum is one of the most attractive spirits categories and the addition of cruzan fills a portfolio gap in premium rum with the categorys fastest growing brand in the u s
8985297 importantly by transitioning to a dedicated sales force focused solely on our brands well simplify our route to market in the u s and enjoy greater control over our distribution
8985298 our seven year partnership with absolut served its purpose but our spirits business is a much bigger company today with the scale and leading positions in key spirits categories to fully leverage the strengths of a dedicated sales force
8985299 we believe moving forward now with this distribution solution will provide valuable clarity and sharper focus to our sales force and will better support beam globals vision of building brands people want to talk about
8985300 this transaction serves shareholders significantly better than allowing the distribution partnership to expire in 2012
8985301 je ne sais pas si le pauvre il peut rester tranquille en ce moment cela d pend de lui

8985304 that is the most disgusting thing i have ever seen
8985305 it is a brick in the foundation and each one has to be better than the last
8985306 the word that comes to mind when i look at the new palm treo pro
8985307 palms buzzworthy treo is merely a flotation device for the troubled company
8985308 what are my concerns that people see the nearly 600 price tag and balk ive been promised good things from palm in the next few months but i worry their time has passed
8985309 the company is on target to post 3q08 net income of 73mn reais and thus has a lot of work to do to meet our 99mn reais estimate in the next two months
8985310 department of natural resources says its usually good to have anywhere between 10 and 20 deer per square mile but here at loch raven there are somewhere between 40 and 90 deer who are eating up all the vegetation
8985311 it would be many thousands of dollars worth of damage
8985312 i thought about the time frame and i thought well if thats the case the river will do what it will do and the road will probably have to be replaced and the extra cost will be borne by the local authority or whoever looks after the road
8985313 any sudden event causing or likely to cause loss of life injury or serious damage to property
8985314 the local authority may take such action or direct the occupier to take such action as is immediately necessary and sufficient to remove the cause of or mitigate any actual or likely adverse effect of the emergency
8985315 at this point in time i have a different interpretation and it is the one we seem to be using around here if the ministry want to make contact and we are shown to be wrong they can show us that we are not going to be prosecuted for doing things that we dont think we should be doing then thats fine im happy to talk to them
8985316 pastoral leases have probably been talked up to be more than what they are
8985317 a pastoral lease only gives a right to the grass but nothing else it doesnt attract the provisions of the trespass act so it doesnt give exclusive occupancy
8985318 its a statutory lease not a common lease so if it only says you have exclusive right to the pasturage then thats it it doesnt say you have exclusive occupation
8985319 from a public access point of view were hugely interested in that it could be a good outcome for the public
8985320 we are very worried about the long term funding from government to manage this damaging pest
8985321 if there is support for industry funded movement controls maf will work with industry groups on how to implement controls in the most cost effective manner
8985322 the implication that the ministry of agriculture and forestry will cease funding any varroa management past july 2009 is seen as the government deserting the beekeeping industry
8985323 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
8985324 im not going to pretend i know how all this came to be
8985325 ive become fascinated by the haiku like artistry that goes into composing a 140 character or less tweet
8985326 but youd be surprised at the substance the heft of many of the conversations that are taking place in the twitter verse
8985327 twitter users tend to be kind of workaholic techie social media internet addict types
8985328 i have to be very conscious of the fact that this is a silo i cant overly rely on these people
8985329 illinois currently mandates corroboration in capital cases and courts in nebraska and oklahoma have required corroboration for jailhouse snitches texas meanwhile has a different requirement not for jailhouse snitches but for undercover drug operatives working for the police
8985330 the governments use of criminal informants is largely secretive unregulated and unaccountable
8985331 this lack of oversight and quality control leads to wrongful convictions more crime disrespect for the law and sometimes even official corruption
8985332 if the criminal system cant get homicide cases right then its very unlikely that were getting other things right
8985333 there are some very basic rights that clearly have to be applied
8985334 the governor is the only person that has the authority to remove him from office she should have thought of this before she embroiled herself
8985335 the issue was is there middle ground that both parties could live with to serve the interests of justice clearly there wasnt
8985336 just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
8985337 since the dude was high all the time he would have to have incredible taste in music
8985338 former stones manager allen klein owns the rights to it
8985339 it got to the part where the dude says i hate the fuckin eagles man klein stands up and says thats it you can have the song that was beautiful
8985340 the eagles sort of single handedly destroyed that whole scene that was brewing back then
8985341 i ran into frey and he gave me some shit
8985342 i cant remember what he said exactly but my anus tightened a bit
8985343 just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
8985344 they indulged in dancing and other social games besides replenishing the inner man at the bar
8985345 the water was perfectly smooth and there was scarcely a breath of wind yet both boats hoisted their sails
8985346 the lake is over rated the arnold river is much better it has the highest concentration of trout in new zealand but access is difficult unless you can drift downstream in a boat i have seen american tourists with big trout they caught in a tributary you probably need to go out with a guide
8985347 the lake is beautiful to fish on but there are many bad days when you cant catch a thing
8985348 i heard a few clubs were interested but sunderland didnt want to sell
8985349 it was the hardest decision of my career i had a chat with roy keane and he didnt want me to go and tried to convince me to stay
8985350 i also met roy hodgson and spoke to roy met fulham and the team and decided i liked it already
8985351 i wanted to go to fulham ive been out for six months and want to move on and play and be closer to my family in london
8985352 i want to thank roy keane for giving me a chance to play in the premier league its been a dream come true for me
8985353 i dont think any player is untouchable thats the first thing i have got to say
8985354 thats not to say in any way shape or form that we want to see michael owen leave this club i certainly would not support that
8985355 but look around football and look whats happening and im afraid a club and a manager not wanting a player to go sometimes is not enough
8985356 at the moment i am sat here very relaxed about where we are yes we have got a lot of injuries that happens in football but those players will get over the injuries they will come back into the team and they will perform for the club

8985569 there was so much emotion in fact his speech was interrupted so many times
8985570 he was very fair in all areas and he did give an awesome speech
8985571 he had a section of his speech about ordinary people falling on hard times enduring catastrophic illnesses and losing everything
8985572 they usually call us at the end or not at all
8985573 guam wasnt just lucky the delegations most split were on the floor
8985574 you have to send somebody to the table that is empowered to negotiate for the department
8985575 i have my boss im in no position to do that
8985576 make sure that management does not give in to policies that would violate personnel policies rules and regulations
8985577 im hopeful because a lot of work has been done
8985578 i just hope that when the inspection takes place there are no leaks right now there arent any in those classrooms but you never know what impact a heavy rain can make
8985579 maybe for guam we need to consider face to face surveys
8985580 one of the biggest reasons we dont have funding is we dont a lot of real data
8985581 there have been attempts of collecting things very unscientifically in recent years but this is significant stuff
8985582 the thing about cancer is its such a multifaceted issue
8985583 yes the bus drivers need bonuses their salary is below the industry norm
8985584 things were being negotiated that i think i dont have the authority to sign that i think are in conflict with established federal laws established local laws and established rules and regulations
8985585 after knocking out a great collective bargaining agreement we only had three clauses left to sign off on when dpw attempted to null and void the entire agreement introducing an illegal bad faith clause
8985586 at press time our attorney was going to court for an order for dpw to negotiate in good faith
8985587 we try to stay within the confines of a 40 hour work week businesses do that
8985588 homeless hungry will work for food for me and my dogs
8985589 wish i had a thousand dollars out of the millions these people politicians are spending on such foolishness just think what that man and his dogs could do with a thousand bucks

8985592 barack obama is telling us exactly what he will do launch a bold new economic plan to restore americas greatness fight for smarter government that trusts the market but protects us against its excesses enact policies that are pro choice pro education and pro family establish a foreign policy that is smart as well as strong provide health care for all and solutions for the climate crisis
8985593 several of mr mccains outside advisers reacted with bewilderment that ms palin was the choice and one said that it would undercut one of mr mccains central criticisms of senator obama that he is too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8985594 while its a dramatic and interesting choice it would make the argument hes making difficult to make
8985595 if you get dressed and get out here you can have some rabbit stew before it goes cold
8985596 as you can see i decided to take you with me up what your people call torr baldwin i have a duty to perform and i couldnt wait around for you to recover to get it done there are a lot more families than yours at risk here i know that you may not understand how the hall fits in but i could either leave you there in the clearing or drag you along with me and look after you i chose the latter and i expect no thanks in making a decision for you that you had no choice in
8985597 i guess i owe you a debt of thanks for dragging me out of there as for me not having a choice well i didnt give you one before when you were out either so as far as i am concerned we can call that square i had planned on going to caer doneghal and letting them know what happened to my family and the villagers at the keep and then continue my training at the green adders school but it seems clear that youre doin something that means a lot to ya what are you going to do
8985598 and i noticed something when i dressed in the tent what became of the cloak i wore it was a gift from my teacher fergus the only thing besides my skill and memories i have to remember him by and i did not see it among my belongings it would pain me greatly to have lost it
8985599 well to answer the easier question first your cloak is here in one of these bundles next to the fire
8985600 you have been out of it for quite some time my dear and i have been rather bored waiting to see if you would wake up i didnt realize the cloak held some personal meaning for you i hope you will forgive me if in my ennui i made a few modifications
8985601 what kind of modifications to my cloak would you be talking about exactly
8985602 oh i was just playing with it really ive never encountered anything made by that process before and i was curious to see just how durable it would be its very interesting material apparently the fabric used helped to hold the original web of energy woven into it contributing to its longevity i simply strengthened it a bit freshened the bindings that holds the power tightly to the cloth and the thought that went into its blending and concealing properties was really very primitive i applied far more sophisticated techniques to the renewed crafting for a simple tool its really quite handy but the way it had been set up it would create quite a mess if it was subjected to rain or mud or dirt it was set up to collect and hide such things until the mass of debris reached a certain point and then it would dump it all in an untidy heap with no warning which i would imagine would be annoying if it were to happen when in the comfort of a friends front hall now it will absorb that mass into its own fabric and continue to use it to repair itself and collect any excess not used in repair in small pockets that i sewed in the bottom of the hem you will be able to empty them out when it is convenient for you of course there is still the problem of being hunted by smell anything it absorbs will still be there leaving its traces in the air if you were pursued by smell you might have to come up with a way to cleanse it on the run and water or other liquids that may soak it they will form in the pockets also and i was very careful to make sure that they would be properly separated one from the other it would be possible were you to find yourself without fresh water to soak your cloak in a salt water sea and the water would fill in some pockets filtered pure and fresh and the other pockets would fill with the brine and impurities but i think that if in the future you find yourself again soaked through with the blood of your enemies you should be very careful from which pocket you choose to drink
8985603 i have been through your belongings while dragging you i wanted to know just what the hell you carried in your pack that weighed more than 15 pounds
8985604 you couldnt begin to imagine my surprise when i found the orc hero raktars spirit warrior medal in your pack with that medal and raktars axe it should be possible to gain you entry to the hall as a spirit warrior i am sorry to say that it will require some effort to transfer the protection from the medal to you but with my aid we can make it work it would be impossible if i had not already taken the power of a full shaman upon me
8985605 it was almost worth the years of feigning subservience to raktar and the other chiefs and shamans just to be able to watch black faces expression when he realized i was taking his magic from him during the first shaman initiation ceremony i wonder how long it will take for the rest of his sept to learn their masterful arrogant commanding black face is powerless ah i can almost see the revenge his harem will take in my minds eye and i bet we could hear the screaming from here but i am getting ahead of myself a bit
8985606 to answer your more difficult question then what i intend to do young warrior is to complete the task i had set for myself here upon this mountain and beyond that task i have no plans at all if you choose to delay your journey i would greatly appreciate your assistance in what i have to do within kelgardelac strung
8985607 by pure chance or twisted fate you have what is needed in your pack to make your way through the wards and into the hall and there will be a greater chance of success if i have your support after we are done and my intentions towards the orcs are fulfilled i would be glad to assist you on your journey it could very well be that the word of an elf might aid you in getting your people organized and as well i have never been to caer doneghal before
8985608 by the by you do keep avoiding the question of what were up to once we are within yon mountain
8985609 i really would rather not speak of it now but i can see you wish to apply your mind to plans for the future rather than dwell on the past so be it
8985610 i plan to remove the constant presence that instills fury hatred and prejudice against humans within the minds of the orc heroes clan chiefs and shamans who come here
8985611 tell me if i understand this right if we go into the hall and your plan is successful then the orc attacks stop
8985612 no its not like that no they will not if i see your meaning you ask if that which lies within the mountain is controlling the orcs making them act as they do im afraid thats not the case
8985613 know you that within this mountain is what my people call kelgardelac strung but your people would have called before the fall of your empire the fastness of mountainfall within which is what the orcs call the hall of mad spirits through a passage heavily warded by the efforts of the orc shamans lies a stone chamber once majestic and proud now shattered and worn within this chamber lies a passage formed of tusks horns and claws that rise up some ten feet high arranged so that a person might walk down this passage surrounded by these jutting monuments to the fury of dragons the strength of the mammoth and the speed of the serpent by making ones way slowly down this passage one is subjected to stresses upon the body and the soul stresses that if endured to the very end opens ones soul to the spirits of all those elemental powers within the hall and a part of the strength of those spirits will become permanently entwined with the life force of the traveler imbuing the successful recipient with power limited only by the strength of the individuals will and the preparations made before entry
8985614 i tell you this history to make sure you understand that the wood spirit launa had no hand in making this artifact i speak of it is not finished or polished properly and from all i have been able to find was made in haste and perhaps out of folly or outright desperation
8985615 the fastness of mountainfall itself in the ancient times long before the war of darkness was once a stronghold of one of the human loremasters of your race a man called the baldwin of the macavoy
8985616 it was a stronghold that had originally been crafted to aid in the fight against the demonkind of the fractured world gate and was long abandoned since and then briefly resurrected in purpose for the final war against the lord of darkness
8985617 i believe that this hall one of the lowest of the stronghold was opened to allow warriors of the army of light who passed through this valley to rest to strengthen themselves and to prepare for one last desperate inhuman effort in what they all knew would be the final battle
8985618 they came here to heal crippling wounds to bathe in the accumulated lifeforce of all of the creatures of gaia and to become as strong as the life of mother earth could make them before they went forth to their last stand against the dark lord of deaths armies
8985619 as you know only too well after the last fall no one ever had cause to return to this place and so the hall has remained open for all of these long years in fact i believe that if it were not for certain intentional falls of rock in the corridors leading upwards into the mountain stronghold itself the orcs might have captured a loremasters war fortress intact launa must have chosen to reduce the power of the orcs and prolong the wars against your people think on that prospect for a while my friend that a spirit even such a selfish one as a forest dryad could hate so deeply as to want to prolong your peoples suffering for many years when at any time she could have given the orcs access to an intact loremaster citadel and provided the means to crush your people at one blow
8985620 well whatever its makers original intent launa has corrupted it and now instead of simply bathing a body and soul in primitive lifeforce channeled in relatively minor ways it now adds launas mad rage and hatred for humanity
8985621 what i propose to do is to make our own preparations perform our own ceremony to open us up to the full mystery of the passage and once within the power structure of the passage we will bend our will upon the lingering presence of launa and the darkness that she has left there and do battle against it and so destroy it
8985622 i had intended to fight this battle myself and take my chances but if you were to join with me i feel that our chances to survive would be much improved
8985623 to have no misunderstanding between us i want you to understand that i do not care whether the orcs continue to gain power here i am not personally concerned with which one of your two races holds power here or anywhere else in this land i am solely concerned with removing this powerful foreign hatred that twists their minds and removes from them the power of personal choice
8985624 it is beyond my power to destroy the artifact it is the work of a loremaster rooted directly to gaia as only one of those fools can do and corrupted by a spirit that serves only gaia and herself i can not hope to do more than redirect its revitalizing powers perhaps if we are truly victorious we could even remove most of the shamanistic power it can impart to future generations of orcs the absolute best we could hope to do would be to bring down the mountain upon it but this is a very stable region of rock and stone and i know of no living person near here close to being powerful enough to do such a thing and regardless such effort as it would take would bring much unwanted attention upon us here at the same time that we would be weakest in our own protection
8985625 no if the hatred is removed from kelgardelac strung the current leaders and shaman elders will continue as they have it will take at least two generations more likely three or four before the orcs will be free to act as they truly intend and not as the puppet of some psychotic forest sprite to be completely honest i would expect the orcs in general to continue to fight with humans forever unless something drastic happens to bring peace or to unite both against a common foe the orcs are a very traditionally minded people they have no reading or writing and all of their history comes from spoken or sung clan and tribal legends they have caused much death and suffering and they have endured much death and suffering they have a tradition of war with your people now it will continue
8985626 at any rate if you do choose to aid me in my quest i would intend to open the wards and enter the hall as soon as you are strong enough to survive the preparations if you are up to it in the morning we can begin to prepare you for the ceremony to allow you entry through the wards once we have passed through and are on the other side of the wards and protected we can focus on preparing for the true challenge and the essaying of the passage itself later into the week come what do you think of this plan
8985627 i hate the gray skinned bastards and probably take a wee bit too much pleasure in killing them but my promise to my family was to restore our lands not to wipe out every orc in the borderlands if going with you gets me closer to that then im in you just need to tell me what to do what is this ceremony you keep talking aboot
8985628 well the power to pass through the wards is keyed into the golden medal you have and bound to two separate essences the axe in your hands and the aura given off by the presence of raktars soul i cannot change what is locked in the gold of the medal as it is meant to act as a keystone upon which all the other spells are tied so i will have to shatter the spirit of the keystone capture the shattered threads of binding and then reweave them and bind their essence directly to your body making you a new living keystone without the medal and the axe that is one of its bound icons this would have been impossible and without my special knowledge of the workings of soul magic and the orc shamanistic pathways we wouldnt be able to key it to you after raktars death
8985629 once we are done you should merely have to hold the axe which is part of the power bound into the keystone to mark you as worthy to enter the hall and walk through the wards unharmed specifically as i can see the fear bold in your eyes i will carve poor choice of words there no inscribe yes inscribe certain symbols and runes upon a round space as large as a handspan upon your stomach symbols that will be subtly different then that upon the medal and then as i shatter the medal i will draw the power from the golden pieces through a channel of my will directly into he symbology in your flesh the symbols will heal as golden runic scars runes similar in appearance to the tribal scars of the blackmoor clan there will be very little lasting pain
8985630 okay this seems like it might be a plan but i think there are a couple more things that need talkin over before we go though
8985631 also i think its only fair that since we have been blooded together that you know my real name its jessie macquarrie because of the idiocy of the men who run the borderland keeps if i try to reclaim my lands as a woman theyll just try to marry me off to some likely son of a bi baron and with that dies my chance of restoring the macquarrie lands so i travel as lauchlin macquarrie who was my twin and brother and id appreciate it if youd call me by that name hopefully one day youll trust me with your real name
8985632 you want my real name would that i had one to give you lauchlin among my people names have no personal meaning they are only descriptions of what one does and how well i chose far dreamer as my orc name because their language is primitive and lacks poetic descriptions in your tongue my homeland name would translate into some three hundred words describing my appearance skills and my past experience here ill give it to in elven that you may say that you have heard it sung my name is baine hel tefhe sheol kar mor le i suppose if you would like to use my name in a short form bane would do well and certainly sounds better than sheol
8985633 there is something you should know about yourself something that i can not with good conscience put off any longer you have perceived that a great deal has changed since you last were awake this place is far from the glade of the oak and im sure you can see that the moon in the sky is far advanced from what you would remember
8985634 you were more than merely wounded when you used the axe in a deep strike against the oak lauchlin you died then died when your soul was ripped from your body by the axe as the power you activated focused a small part of your soul into a spike and drove it hard into the soul of the oak the rest of your soul was ripped free and drawn to a place far removed from the paths of the light your spirit was gone from the mortal world lauchlin
8985635 by rights you should never have awoken but somehow i knew that in time i could lead you back to the ways of the sun you couldnt have known what would happen when you triggered the axe and most of the reason is that ive never been much for explaining things ive always been interested in mastering the doing of a thing for myself not for showing another
8985636 i told you the command word to activate the axe and unleash its stored power on a foe i neglected however to warn you that if the axe had not fed deeply enough on the souls of the slain before you uttered the command it would take what more it needed from you
8985637 the axe drew all the power it could from the only source it had it drained you dry focused the power in your soul and channeled it as a weapon and the pure force of the energy destroyed the tree fortunately i not only had the knowledge to help you activate the axe and cause this tragedy but i also knew quite a bit about what it had done to you your body was dead as we reckon these things because your soul had been flung far away much of its inherent cohesiveness diminished most especially that which was flung at the tree as a weapon after the axe had fed
8985638 i have certain unique knowledge and skills concerning the power of the soul we will not take the time to speak of them or where i learned them as we do not have days to devote to such things but i knew that no matter how much the axe had fed from the edges of your soul the infinite core of your being would still be intact but drifting somewhere in the dreamtime i had to wait until we were safe so i brought your body up here where the pass is difficult to achieve and easily defended it is here that i performed the rituals and did what i needed to do to answer the blood debt i owed
8985639 since the axe had cast you to the same place it sends all of its victims i used the axe as a bonded link to reach out to you again and draw you back home your body welcomed the return but im afraid youre going to have to make some adjustments
8985640 you will probably feel very strong very fit and very hard you will find certain new skills come easily to you perhaps you will even think or dream in languages you have never before heard spoken aloud perhaps there will be even more
8985641 you see i sent the call for your return out into the dreamtime but your soul was no longer separate and distinct you were wounded very deeply and much of your vitality and energy much of your very life had been torn from you but where you were drifting there in the dreamtime it is not an empty place it is that peculiar place where the souls of many of the past victims of the axe dwell those too wounded and drained too fractured to ever recover on their own but too damn strong or stubborn to simply dissipate and die the ultimate death
8985642 when i sent out the call through the axe it drew the souls of all nearby that had ties to it and that axe has a very long and terrible history it has rarely in its existence been used to kill the weak or the stupid it is the slayer of heroes and champions and has long been in the hands of the most evil and terrible monsters of this world and now your soul is inextricably bound with the souls of those long dead those who number among them some of the most heroic and powerful heroes of the light that our world has ever known and i do not know what effect this may have on you over time
8985643 im not really certain what the future will bring for you young lady it all depends on how strong your spirit really is are you strong enough to hold yourself together as the other parts of your soul parts that were never part of your life or experience or time pull you in different directions as they try to make you follow a different set of stars
8985644 can you somehow maintain your own identity even as you fight to integrate your mingled souls into one pure heart i honestly dont know you have the advantage since your core personality was mostly intact and new to the dreamtime and they should be mostly fractured remnants and shattered ghosts of spirits but that they were still there in the dreamtime where the axe cast them strong and vital shows that they were the most powerful and above all the most stubborn of all of the victims that the axe has taken only time will tell
8985645 being named an honoree of the inaugural fast 50 is a wonderful recognition of the hard work and innovation that have made builderfusion a top provider of member management software for professional associations
8985646 since the company was founded nearly eight years ago its flagship builderfusion software has given professional associations around the nation the power to eliminate redundant data entry drive down operating costs and communicate more effectively with their members
8985647 we are excited about the renewal of the show to a second airing
8985648 the reception to the first show exceeded our expectations we received many promising applicants it just shows how passionate people are about their ideas and we are thrilled to have another opportunity for rewarding that passion and hard work i think the show has struck a core of hope about business instead of the despair we hear every day
8985649 this industry wide and pacific rimfocused meeting is designed to bring together representatives from across the financial information industry throughout the pac rim to discuss topics such as reducing business risks effective data management strategies key issues facing market and reference data and much more financial services professionals of all types can certainly benefit from this type of forum and collaboration especially with our industry growing and evolving so rapidly
8985650 in addition to a wealth of relevant topics and presenters at this years conference we are pleased to tout two topnotch keynote speakers paul man yiu chow and neal lipschutz who we are very fortunate to have join us
8985651 i basically told george that i was involved in the company as a major investor
8985652 and wanted him to be aware of it in case the issue ever came up
8985653 simmons seemingly greased every palm in the statehouse to smooth his radioactive plans with his company waste control specialists giving more than 2 million in political cash since 2001 while spending 2 8 million on 63 lobby contracts according to texans for public justice
8985654 we reiterate our request that the department of justice fulfill its commitment to take prompt action to investigate and to prosecute the american issues project and we further request that the department of justice investigate and prosecute howard sic simmons for a knowing and willful violation of the individual aggregate contribution limits
8985655 political contributions are dwarfed by my charitable contributions of 400 million
8985656 a provision in the tax bill included at the behest of several members of congress including freshman rep kenny hulshof r mo would have granted simmons something both he and 2 000 beet farmers in oregon desired a graceful exit out of a joint venture deal that they had struck for the sole purpose of reducing or eliminating altogether a bill for 80 million in capital gains taxes simmons was facing
8985657 to avoid capital gains simmons came up with a cumbersome arrangement form a joint venture with the snake river sugar cooperative a group of 2 000 oregon beet farmers formed for this purpose and have the joint venture own the refinery and share the profits under the tax laws this arrangement was not technically a sale and simmons owed no capital gains taxes even though the cooperative paid him 260 million in the deal
8985658 the new legislation would not provide me any additional deferral above what i have already received
8985659 reports of an additional tax benefit to me are based on inaccurate information and are incorrect
8985660 i strongly urge you not to use this important tool at this time
8985661 this is a vendetta against harold simmons and thats sad
8985662 they tried to shoot harold simmons and instead they shot our 2 000 growers
8985663 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks

8985672 its hard to believe that the u s would sabotage the deal at this stage after having initiated the deal and gone out of its way to placate india
8985673 in any case india was involved in negotiating every phrase in the resolutions brought before the iaea and the nsg its futile for india to blame the u s it was at best na ve for it to trust washington to do everything at the nsg
8985674 you can bet that there are some lawmakers who want to bring in amendments
8985675 a large number of countries big and small expressed views similar to new zealands that there needed to be compatibility between the us india agreement and the goals of the nsg the discussions last week were robust and constructive
8985676 while new zealand remains a strong advocate of the npt and the comprehensive test ban treaty and would welcome indias accession to these we have not included these in our package of proposals
8985677 in no way prejudge s the decision on a possible india specific exemption in the nsg
8985678 although the statement was a clear warning indian negotiators ignored it
8985679 they thought a combination of u s strong arm pressures and indias new with us or against us diplomacy would do the trick
8985680 based on concepts already enshrined in u n security council resolutions in domestic legislation of nsg member states and in bilateral nuclear supply agreements which they have concluded over the years
8985681 the u s will probably try to persuade india to accept at least one of the three proposed conditions namely exclusion of enrichment and reprocessing technology
8985682 it is hard to say if india will agree to this while accepting a periodic review of its non proliferation commitments and cessation of cooperation in case of an indian nuclear test
8985683 that the nsg dissenters will be satisfied with such a modified draft the chances of the deal going through before the present term of the u s congress ends seem low

8985697 the major studios have neglected the marketplace for quality intelligent cinema
8985698 with the recently announced closings of picturehouse warner independent pictures and other specialty divisions the quality and quantity of titles available for empire film group for distribution has dramatically increased we intend to move quickly on this substantial opportunity and in doing can reach empires financial goals more quickly
8985699 the acquisition and release of high profile titles such as these will build a solid financial foundation for empire
8985700 the major studios are all moving towards event level films for release in 4 000 or more theaters but in doing so they have left empire with an open market to distribute films meriting release to 1 000 or less theaters empire can build a major operation with independent films such as juno little miss sunshine or my big fat greek wedding which have huge audiences but do not fit the event level model of the major studios its a tremendous opportunity that we intend to fill

8985715 iris annual reports for 2003 and 2004 include among their lists of volunteers a significant number of republican pollsters consultants strategists public opinion researchers and campaign website designers some of whom have come under fire for unethical practices
8985716 for example rob autry and gene ulm are with public opinion strategies the largest republican polling firm
8985717 he seems like a sensible person with some really good ideas
8985718 i think if the other fellow gets to be president itd be like four more years of bush and im not anxious to see that happen
8985719 plus the other guy has said he doesnt mind if we stay iraq for a hundred years
8985720 oh i think hes got some good ideas about energy obama wants to do more with wind and solar but mccain just wants to drill more which i dont know oils important but its not the most forward thinking policy you know
8985721 it doesnt really matter if someones a republican or a democrat
8985722 some authors may frown upon this and out of respect to them i will not post at this time
8985723 hicimos un gran esfuerzo un gran trabajo pero los resultados no se dieron y el olimpia no puede seguir as

8985725 it is essential though that you get your jaws around the latest offering from the london stable a simply colossal offering from stray ghost in the shape of losthilde
8985726 with the four epic tracks of losthilde stray ghost aka ant saggers has crafted an engrossing and emotion rich essay on a loss
8985727 one of the most successful hybrids of quiet reflection and fierce noise that i ve heard for a while but never gets stuck in that quiet build loud end clich
8985728 hes just a darling every single day he comes in to get his paper and gives us lollies now this has happened
8985729 its just like heres another accident down here whens it going to stop you take your life in your hands every day
8985730 he wouldnt go in the ambulance he said i dont need that thing
8985731 se o senhor n o deixar eu explicar o senhor n o vai entender
8985732 you used to struggle to get them in here and then theyd say why arent we in the paddock now they come over quite quickly
8985733 and they still get through their academic work in the same time as they did before we had the farm
8985734 because we can actually go out and do something real and still be academic
8985735 we used to be a dumping ground now the kids are opting for the agriculture course
8985736 apparently sheep or lambs arent mentioned in the bylaws so the dog control officer really had no jurisdiction to be there anyway at the time i had a horrible cold i was probably coughing louder than the lamb was bleating
8985737 a whole lot of bleating lambs in a shed is ear muff material we were going to do it this week but the way the weather is and the lambs wont mind having a tail for another week
8985738 you can do hip hop or whatever else for scholarship but you cant do agriculture and considering we earn 80 percent of the countrys money it is a bit strange
8985739 the aim is these guys can go to university when they finish if they want to or go and work on a farm with unit standards they are pretty much limited to working on a farm well thats the way i see it
8985740 but you come here and it sort of backs it up and you get more information on how to do it
8985741 do a bit of theory on those kind of days
8985742 there would be a lot of farm workers out there who wouldnt have a clue how to do it like these guys do
8985743 and not just labour i remember a couple of years ago all the fertiliser companies were screaming out for qualified people
8985744 so we have actually done a lot of work or are in the process of doing so in a few years we should make a few bucks once we get it developed
8985745 if one of the other schools want to do a shearing course they just have to find themselves some sheep and come up here
8985746 it can vary from a few hours to a few days
8985747 i think it is really slack as a customer we cant go anywhere else because they own the lines
8985748 we just want to know what is going on but no one will talk to us
8985749 we would love to have broadband weve got children who need the internet we want the telephone but we cant get it because it is something thats not available to us
8985750 getting our customer service right is something we take very seriously
8985751 it was a step up from the last few weeks
8985752 the team was playing at home and knew it had to concentrate on its own game northland had been playing well
8985753 that spot of earth smiles on me more than any other
8985754 i am confident that that investment in coaching and development of players will have rewards in future years
8985755 ive had two close calls already and that is two too many you dont even want one a year but you see it and hear about it all the time here
8985756 it just made me bloody angry i gave him a barrelling and he just laughed its just so stupid to put your life in danger like that
8985757 i had to go to the coroners the last time someone trying to dodge the train was killed seeing the family there upset and crying well thats not a fun feeling knowing youve killed someone even if you couldnt have done anything about it thats not a fun feeling either
8985758 what people dont think about is that not only does the train driver have to see the initial horrific scene but the firemen the police and the ambulance drivers all have to cope with these terrible incidents all of these people have to live with the consequences of one persons stupidity
8985759 the response to the all blacks match in taranaki has been pretty special with a lot of invitations from the community
8985760 the team cant get to everyone but hopefully a lot of fans can attend mondays training and meet some of the players
8985761 the taranaki public can watch all blacks training and meet some of their favourite players afterwards
8985762 the opportunity is there to collect autographs from players in the 26 man squad gates open at midday with the signing session scheduled from 12 30pm to 1pm
8985763 hopefully we will be able to establish how and why the fire was started
8985764 there is some indication that there may have been a disagreement between some of the people present immediately prior to the fire being located
8985765 i met a guy and he was mates with the magogs so i sort of started hanging out with them
8985766 because they didnt really treat me like a cripple they didnt treat me like i had no brain
8985767 ive only just learnt to handle it cause years ago i would just nut off
8985768 he was her dream rock star so she would have done anything to get to him
8985769 she was really impressed with the book and said it gave her an insight into helens character because helens character is in the book
8985770 if you have a problem with the abovementioned i recommend you dont read this book
8985771 helen wanted the book to have an impact on people in that type of lifestyle
8985772 for people who are in a desperate situation there is a life giving message in it for them if they want to take it
8985773 helens written it in a light sort of way without being too heavy handed
8985774 its an adults book i wouldnt recommend it to teenagers
8985775 ive never blamed god it was my own doing for getting drunk and stoned and trusting a fool to drive the car
8985776 the drivers life changed too that night because of what he did to helen he was quite messed up
8985777 helen said to the guy look if i didnt have the accident i wouldnt have met god and i wouldnt have met steve and i may have had a completely different life and i am glad i am having the life im having
8985778 i dont want to be known as a weak helpless cripple
8985779 that level of uncertainty is a bit unusual and indicates that earnings have higher risk in terms of the accuracy of forecasts
8985780 the results show that the companies have done a pretty good job of guiding the market in terms of profit expectations
8985781 but all of them without exception are finding operating conditions a big surprise
8985782 if anything the new zealand economy has run stronger for longer than expected as the reporting season progressed it seems to have got better
8985783 you cannot look broadly at the new zealand market now and say that overall conditions are tough out there and therefore companies are being impacted
8985784 the outlook was not robust but it certainly gave investors comfort that the company is in a good state to withstand the downturn in the domestic economy
8985785 over the next six months the independent markets should start to decouple the synchronisation with the global shock
8985786 within three weeks of showing him a picture i had something even better sitting in my workshop for about 20 000
8985787 you get higher wages here but you will spend more and there is more tax
8985788 we had looked everywhere and the lack of apprentice training in the late 80s and 90s hadnt helped
8985789 our international staff have a wonderful work ethic and add huge value to our existing culture
8985790 they are incredibly loyal the more you give the more they give
8985791 its important to make the most of people coming here and who do want to be here
8985792 new zealand is already competing with australia advertising mining jobs in the paper
8985793 we are not a recruitment agency but our business is to help small businesses so if they cant get the right workforce then its our business
8985794 the majority of people who first come to new zealand even from england or south africa say it can be difficult to fit in with their employer it may be even things like the time of day you start work whether you are expected to go out to dinner with your boss and how you address them
8985795 it was quite hard especially for a person coming from a country with a different language
8985796 not all of the kiwis accept a person like me but i was fortunate to meet my previous boss
8985797 theyre going to say he only chose her because shes a woman
8985798 when you really believe in something you have to make a bold statement
8985799 losing my hair this way is nothing like what people with cancer go through and for women it is awful losing their hair
8985800 i was hoping more people would come and support my cause
8985801 i just want to raise awareness my brothers cancer started off as melanoma and has rapidly progressed i want to let people know that there are worse things in life than losing your hair
8985802 i am aware that there is a higher risk for me to get a form of cancer because its in my family i already have my share of health problems like epilepsy diabetes and hyper thyroidism
8985803 i cant believe im still around with all my health problems and i have watched so many people around me die all i know is death is apart of life and somehow all of this has made me a stronger person
8985804 it is great having him out here with our lads today we look forward to him coming to the game tomorrow we are confident that pablo is in a special place at st jude it is great to have a place like that in our city
8985805 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8985806 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8985807 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8985808 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8985809 chile consagra formalmente una nueva mirada sobre la discapacidad que deber a contribuir a poner al d a nuestra legislaci n y nuestras pol ticas p blicas
8985810 bachelet promulga convenci n internacional sobre derechos de los discapacitados
8985811 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
8985812 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
8985813 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
8985814 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
8985815 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
8985816 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
8985817 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8985818 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8985819 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
8985820 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
8985821 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8985822 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n
8985823 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
8985824 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
8985825 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
8985826 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8985827 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
8985828 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

8985831 i wonder how many would be able to detect truth from fiction in this anthology
8985832 if the editors had not printed the names of the contributors

8985838 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
8985839 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
8985840 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
8985841 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
8985842 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

8985903 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8985904 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo

8985912 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
8985913 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
8985914 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
8985915 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8985916 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8985917 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8985918 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
8985919 la escuela en un alto grado es una fuente de cultivo para el racismo la discriminaci n la negaci n de todo lo mapuche

8985922 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge
8985923 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8985924 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8985925 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8985926 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8985927 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
8985928 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad

8985931 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

8985946 a partnership consisting of respected qc and horse enthusiasts alan galbraith and justice bill wilson
8985947 such a business must require a high degree of trust and dependence on each other which it is submitted makes it inappropriate for justice wilson to hear argument from mr galbraith on substantive matters
8985948 a judge shall not engage in financial and business dealings that involve the judge in frequent transactions or continuing business relationships with those lawyers or other persons likely to come before the court on which the judge serves
8985949 firstly the disclosure was wholly inadequate and significantly downplayed the degree of the common financial and business interests
8985950 secondly where bias exists the judicial officer concerned is obliged to deal with it a waiver by the litigants even if fully informed is not adequate
8985951 fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind
8985952 the judge should raise the matter at the earliest opportunity with the head of the jurisdiction in this case the head of the appeal court and the parties or their legal advisers
8985953 if the judge decides to sit the reasons for that decision should be recorded in open court so should the disclosure of all relevant circumstances
8985954 will await the commissioners decision before making any further comment

8985981 but to win we have to race aggressively we cant wait until the end
8985982 some guys will be in the early break someone will be helping our key guys keeping them in the right place and bringing them to the front before the big climb
8985983 obviously this is a new great experience for joe and phil to be part of the pro team at nationals
8985984 joe needs to be active in the early part of the race and if any break goes he will need to be there for phil this is his first race with the team after his surgery so he will be helping the guys from the beginning until the end
8985985 the important thing is to see where he stands now
8985986 this will be very helpful for his preparation for the 2009 season
8985987 im very happy with the route this year itll be a great vuelta there are some tough mountain stages and a few tough ones in between as well so it should be interesting i think the stages in asturia might be quite decisive we have a very competent group of guys here even though theres only one rider from the tour line up all nine of us are top motivated and thats what counts i might automatically be among the favorites because i won the tour but some of the other guys and teams will also have to step up and claim responsibility in this race especially alberto contador whos been preparing himself specifically for the vuelta im confident that we as a team will be able to put our mark on this race
8985988 as usual we have a broad team with a lot of different strengths both karsten kroon and alexandr kolobnev are able to neutralize breaks in all kinds of terrain and for the sprints in the first week we have haedo and matti then we have volodymir gustov inigo cuesta and michael blaudzun whos jobs are to assist carlos as much as possible and if jurgen is as strong in the mountains as last year he should be able to do well
8985989 theres no doubt that our main goal is the podium in madrid but we also have some great opportunities along the way
8985990 of course itll be quite a strange experience for me ill be nostalgic at times im sure but im at peace with my decision and ive had time to get used to the idea since i made it during last winter but im looking forward to this race and i hope to be able to do well in both the first time trial and as helper for carlos along the way
8985991 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing

8985993 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
8985994 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
8985995 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers

8986041 not necessarily i dont think that necessarily proves that you are on form or not a good solid performance does nowadays in europe if you finish from 10th up you are performing quite well because it is tough to win and you have to be fortunate at the right times

8986111 we are particularly concerned at the secondary scamming that seems to be going on vultures in the shape of lawyers and consultants circling and picking the investors bones clean
8986112 if youre coming out publicly with a white knight image you really must be clear about where youre coming from what you charge chances of success and the timeframe involved
8986113 here they are with their recovery roadshow tearing up and down the country asking people to cough up 120 and then telling people their own hardship stories thats not helping thats helping themselves
8986114 time is a luxury for many of these people this kind of interference is compounding their problems its all about revenge and reparation eufa is trying to become the gatekeeper when it clearly has no right
8986115 regrettably its when people are at their most vulnerable that they believe anything these people are living a jet setters lifestyle which these gullible investors are unwittingly paying for its nothing more than exploitation for self gain
8986116 if anyone wants to suggest that im somehow making a nest egg out of this then theyre welcome to and i hope they get their jollies out of it
8986117 the message has to be understood when times are tough you need lawyers to solve the problem im not sure eufa understand this
8986118 protesting isnt going to get you anywhere the only way to get any comfort is through issuing proceedings weve recovered some money sued lawyers were suing developers weve got injunctions and weve stopped mortgage payments
8986119 legal proceedings are very expensive being part of a group makes it affordable for people who have seemingly lost everything
8986120 isnt it better having one firm one group of barristers acting rather than 10 different barristers with 10 different ideas a nuclear attack instead of a shotgun approach all we got from the government was a pathetic response saying how people should be free to go where they like
8986121 there was no one else out there lobbying on behalf of investors no one challenging a lack of progress lack of action for that matter by statutory organisations
8986122 not so long ago the securities commission came out and said dont worry we will monitor the likes of bridgecorp if the laws worked properly or these authorities had done their job better maybe some of this wouldnt have happened
8986123 i just hit the starter button and it didnt work
8986124 we tried everything in the end we rolled the car back pushed it and finally got it going it had nothing to do with tactics
8986125 so tomorrow it looks like ill be first car on the road ok it wont be easy but weve found a good rhythm today so well see what we can do
8986126 because its received disproportionate media coverage the whole purpose of his judgment has been undermined completely
8986127 unfortunately perhaps the effectiveness of what he has tried to do has been eliminated
8986128 that is really up to you ive invited argument on this point
8986129 i can proceed without hearing from the media and that would be totally unfair
8986130 to the publication of any accounts of what took place in court on the internet by way of online news publication or stored video
8986131 weve been to more than 100 countries but this is the first time weve had this happen
8986132 were not a chartered boat so we could face a 50 000 nz132 000 fine if we break the law
8986133 its quite frustrating health and safety in this country is sort of out of control but when you think weve been shot at by colombians then i suppose this is small fry
8986134 there are guys that people dont know that ive been in love with ive had secret lovers
8986135 i dont want to talk about it but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run
8986136 i would walk down the school halls and hear people talking about me
8986137 nos tr s primeiros dias principalmente e at os cinco primeiros dias em que h um efeito muito forte da s ndrome de abstin ncia

8986139 a oms organiza o mundial de sa de classifica a pessoa que tem a depend ncia do tabaco como um doente
8986140 muitas vezes as pessoas est o hostilizando aquele que fuma com leis repudiando como se fosse uma coisa totalmente indesej vel um ser humano que est ali que por algum fator do passado alguma decis o errada adquiriu o v cio de fumar
8986141 s vezes essa pessoa tem car ncia algum tipo de depress o e usa o cigarro como uma fuga
8986142 a ltima palestra do nosso curso um novo estilo de vida para um ex fumante e exatamente essa palestra a mais importante do nosso curso a gente visa exatamente a reeducar esse fumante ensinar a ele a ter um novo padr o de vida

8986144 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
8986145 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
8986146 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
8986147 i feel a lot better now though because at least i know i will have a home to come back to
8986148 its like youve been slapped so hard in the past that you can almost still feel it i just know how much work it was rebuilding everything
8986149 possa ajudar a sacodir washington e fazer com que a pol tica trabalhe para as pessoas que contam conosco
8986150 palin juntou republicanos e democratas em sua administra o e tem um hist rico de mudan a e reformas que necessitamos em washington
8986151 hoje john mccain colocou a ex prefeita de um munic pio de 9 mil habitantes com experi ncia zero em pol tica externa e a um passo da presid ncia
8986152 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year
8986153 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
8986154 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
8986155 if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
8986156 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8986157 afghanistan is dicey i think there are certain areas of the country particularly along the pakistani border that are clearly not under the control of either pakistan or the afghan government
8986158 i am concerned about it but im not as concerned as i am about iraq today obviously or i would be talking about afghanistan but i believe if president hamid karzai can make the progress that he is making that in the long term we may muddle through it in afghanistan
8986159 and when one of his chief advisers the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession and that weve become and i quote a nation of whiners
8986160 phil gramm does not speak for me i speak for me
8986161 how else could he offer a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement
8986162 does anybody have a clinical degree in here he looks like a million bucks kicking the ball all over the place in practice and he gets in the game and he gets rally anxious you saw it were trying to manage it i dont know what else to do hes a great kid but he has to handle it himself he cant wait until monday we cant clean this up on monday we talked to him on the sideline in a very pleasant tone that he has to get through that during the game
8986163 ok lets put backup brandon yingling in there after all he was perfect on his pat attempts or throw in danny milligan or somebody anybody else

8986167 o aumento dos pre os n o algo isolado mais uma medida que vem apoiar o fumante para que ele deixe de fumar
8986168 ela est analisando isso e esperamos que em breve tenha algum resultado nesse sentido no ano passado a receita aumentou a al quota do ipi e gerou um aumento de 30 dos cigarros brasileiros foi um grande avan o claro que ainda n o o que gostar amos em termos de pre o mas foi um grande passo no sentido de alinhar a pol tica de pre os e impostos sobre o setor fumo aos compromissos que o brasil assumiu

8986170 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8986171 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
8986172 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
8986173 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
8986174 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened

8986178 lo que dije fue que me ten a que plantear muchas cosas porque fue un fracaso personal no llegar a la final ya que estuve cerca de 12 meses preparando los juegos y por tanto cuando no salen bien las cosas la decepci n es grande

8986188 gates of hell but wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8986189 i was hoping to arrive on stage riding on the back of a giant 50 foot worm made of tinsel rather like the sandworms in the film dune but apparently it was ludicrously expensive
8986190 a tinsel worm is a bit gaudier you know its a bit more cheap its down on the street not your exclusive worm its a worm of the people
8986191 im naturally more disposed now to think up things in the evening after so many years of performing its ingrained now i tend to associate evenings with having to think up jokes
8986192 tv is a different kind of buzz because its in the final process its a delayed reaction type of gig whereas standup is very immediate for shameless gratification junkies its more of a hit
8986193 its a function of comedy in a way to prick at peoples self importance its quite powerful like that it can seep through the cracks a little bit where other things cant get through
8986194 i think producers casting a film normally get agents and casting people and i just get a petition sent through it must just really annoy them
8986195 but id love to be in the hobbit it would be great what a fantastic gig ive had furry feet for years now im ready to go at a moments notice

8986199 both brit and k fed refused to give an inch beyond the current custody status
8986200 the long drawn out conference seemed to take its toll on the recovering pop star following the meeting brit went directly back to her studio city home at the summit and then headed to the ritz carlton hotel where she promptly booked a massage and sauna session
8986201 may a real american have the honor of putting a bullet between her eyes
8986202 a patriot tired of right wing nazi fascist government attempted to rid america of those who would do us harm
8986203 the joke about boiling the boot and the pukeko for 10 hours and then eating the boot has been around for years
8986204 t s eliot i think says somewhere that before a country has a culture it has a cuisine
8986205 in a larger sense that might be right but we had got things the wrong way around if our ancestors had brought a cuisine with them then their suitcases of recipes were either washed overboard or lost by british airways at heathrow new zealanders as a nation could not cook
8986206 while our culinary dexterity as slice bikkie and cake makers may not be as sexy as bronzed mediterranean peasants conjuring a delicious meal out of a rocky hillside it is ours
8986207 the full tins that this baking produced also seem to me to nicely bring together frontier hospitality scottish traditions of hospitality and maori manaakitanga hospitality and respect for guests the sharing of food the taking of gifts of food and wine when visiting is another aspect of new zealand food behaviour which has its origins in these parts of our past
8986208 the lange government revolution meant all the rules changed again it got overwhelmed by international styles
8986209 one of the things thats interesting about the idea of a national cuisine is that it seems to be something that people only start talking about and codifying at the point they perceive that its disappearing
8986210 the idea of boiling poultry instead of roasting it is something that we tend not to do and so i did a bit of that using boiler chickens that you can get from chinese supermarkets theyre very hard to find elsewhere any more its interesting when youre used to these industrialised chooks that roast to the texture of marshmallow to get a piece of poultry that can stand bubbling away in the pot for hours and still emerge with some sort of texture
8986211 people telling their fellow citizens what they should be eating
8986212 theres a strong pattern of that in new zealand cooking
8986213 ive interviewed a couple of women whose mothers were staunch followers of ulric williams both of them lived well into their 90s but both of them suffered from goitre because he was very much against iodised salt you really do have to deal with the lack of iodine in new zealand soils
8986214 he seems to have been very influential i remember living in flats in the 1970s where it was thought that anything that contained white flour or white sugar would cause people to drop dead within minutes of eating it
8986215 in the 1930s there was quite a number of flash english cookbooks by chefs that have toheroa soup we were obviously exporting it in tins its one of the few things that was seen as luxurious enough to turn up in those books
8986216 and pavlova has spread across the world lemon delicious pudding turns up in all sorts of spots the first thing thats identifiably a lemon delicious pudding turns up in 1916 in new zealand so we can probably claim it as one of ours
8986217 the team at ciao has built a passionate consumer community based on intuitive technology and extensive merchant relationships that we believe will deliver incremental benefit to the microsoft live search platform
8986218 john mccains choice of sarah palin as his running mate proves just how rigid and extreme his administration would be when it comes to a womans right to choose
8986219 for 25 years mccain has opposed a womans right to choose and we know that he will continue to push anti choice policies in the white house mccains pick of anti choice sarah palin is further evidence that his white house will be just another four years of bush style policies any remaining doubts about mccains extreme anti choice position should be put to rest when voters learn about the combined anti choice records of sarah palin and john mccain

8986222 now i understand the value of a trusted travel agent versus buying online
8986223 they just dont have the economies of scale they dont have the capital the deep pockets to sustain these brutal fuel prices
8986224 if theres even a hint of trouble even if its not completely warranted people will abandon it the airline overnight and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy and so generally in these kinds of situations they try to keep the airline going the company going until all avenues have been exhausted and i think they ran out of time

8986229 steven gerrard has had the operation it was not serious but he will not be available until after the international break
8986230 i have spoken to fabio capello about the situation he asked me how steven was and it was a good conversation everything was positive between us and i have explained to him the timing and when he will be fit
8986231 we had no option but to have the operation done now there will be another international break soon anyway and we could not wait any longer
8986232 crisis management is the only strategy that i am able to apply
8986233 we have to go to the israelis to get permission to do projects like drilling building reservoirs or laying pipes
8986234 we are all suffering from climate change in the region israel and jordan are also affected
8986235 but we suffer the worst because we dont have control over our own resources
8986236 we conducted emergency water trucking for 10 communities in southern hebron
8986237 this loss of food is equivalent to a loss in water
8986238 another 10 to 15 percent is discarded during processing transport and storage in richer countries production is more efficient but waste is greater people toss the food they buy and all the resources used to grow ship and produce the food along with it
8986239 the attention now because of the global food crisis has shifted towards improving food production while no one is paying attention to address the losses and wastage already taking place
8986240 distribution and access to food is a problem while at the same time many people in many parts of the world over eat
8986241 people have access to more money and diets that include meat and milk
8986242 much of the future increase will be fed to animals to satisfy the demand for meat today some 650 million tonnes of grain nearly 40 percent of global production is fed to livestock and this may reach 1100 million tonnes by 2050
8986243 for example 500 to 4 000 litres of water are evaporated in producing one kilogram of wheat depending on climate agricultural practices variety length of the growing season and yield
8986244 however to produce one kilogramme of meat takes 5 000 to 20 000 litres mainly to grow animal feed in terms of the energy content of food approximately 0 5 m3 of water is needed to produce 1 000 kcal of plant based food while for animal based food some 4 m3 of water is required
8986245 agriculture in countries in central south and south east asia which are largely dependent on river water for irrigation will be hit by a projected drop in river levels an estimated 1 4 billion people already live in areas where there is not enough water available to meet all needs from sectors of society let alone the need of aquatic ecosystems
8986246 countries have to come to up with innovative ways to capture and beneficially use the rain falling on farmers fields to increase the fraction of the rains that can be productively used and to lessen stresses on rivers and groundwater
8986247 may these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart
8986248 i have a dream today a dream deeply rooted in the american dream
8986249 when the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence
8986250 but it helps them become good citizens that was the way i was taught when i was a child its not abuse i love my grandchildren how could i abuse them
8986251 but the statistics are just the tip of the iceberg
8986252 if an adult hits a child no one reports this to the relevant authorities
8986253 that would only happen if a child was badly injured then the police would come in but they would just handle the case by charging the parent with creating disorder or making loud sounds rather than child abuse
8986254 if you slap a child that violates the law but no one reports that
8986255 these are seen as normal acts according to the law one has to have 11 percent of the body injured to make it a criminal case
8986256 many people have no idea that boys can be sexually abused
8986257 they dont imagine what kind of abuse that could be so they never think that boys need to be protected
8986258 i only hit my son to teach him to become a good man of course there are limitations you cannot beat a kid too hard
8986259 its really a challenge to raise awareness among people its tradition

8986270 14 now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god 15 and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
8986271 44 and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand for ever
8986272 13 i saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him 14 and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed
8986273 14 now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god 15 and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
8986274 9 now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing 10 for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death
8986275 involves both a turning from sin and a turning to god
8986276 10 for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death
8986277 30 and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commandeth all men every where to repent
8986278 20 but shewed first unto them of damascus and at jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of judaea and then to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meet for repentance
8986279 25 and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more
8986280 21 testifying both to the jews and also to the greeks repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ
8986281 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
8986282 now faith is being sure of what we hope for
8986283 31 but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name
8986284 15 and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
8986285 24 and some believed the things which were spoken and some believed not 25 and when they agreed not among themselves they departed after that paul had spoken one word well spake the holy ghost by esaias the prophet unto our fathers 26 saying go unto this people and say hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and not perceive 27 for the heart of this people is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them 28 be it known therefore unto you that the salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles and that they will hear it
8986286 20 which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places 21 far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come 22 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church
8986287 13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son
8986288 5 for this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god
8986289 22 who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him
8986290 15 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature 16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned

8986332 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8986333 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
8986334 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
8986335 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8986336 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
8986337 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

8986345 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
8986346 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
8986347 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price

8986752 countdown is a unique show with a very loyal audience and for that reason i felt that they needed someone who was part of the countdown family like jo brand it was great to be asked but i was worried i would fail the physical
8986753 a good deal of time has been taken up mulling over my countdown conundrum an approach to host the programme came as much as a surprise to me as to anyone else
8986754 my reaction was rather as one would have felt a year or two ago about a proposition from anna nicole smith while im not yet as old as the previous incumbent i cant help wondering what it would be like

8986824 calling it a tipping point is a big call but its probably the closest thing weve had to it
8986825 you can sense the momentum and you can sense the inevitability of it
8986826 there has been definitely a swing to the high definition sets within our business both through and before the olympics
8986827 were a retailer whatever the suppliers supply well stock and well put an emphasis on whats selling
8986828 we dont give a rats arse what it is well sell it if people want it
8986829 and the vast majority of flat panel tvs are high definition
8986830 the olympics is always a trigger of sales of large screen tvs irrespective of the resolution
8986831 whats changed is hd tvs are significantly more affordable and much more widely available but a tipping point has been reached mainly because the content is available the olympics do cause consumers to buy hd tvs but theres also a greater awareness of hd tv because broadcasters are broadcasting specific hd content
8986832 sport sells everything better than anything else especially to australians
8986833 the olympics was a huge television event and because it was in hd it was an even more significant event and the afl in hd has got more legs this season than last and i would suspect come finals time with the number of hd sets now in homes that will boost the format again it has to
8986834 at the olympics we saw some amazing pictures arrows going through the air targets exploding and the power field events on the track and field and we saw many many frozen drops of water in the pool
8986835 in the past few months hd has gone from being an abstract concept to being something real in peoples minds
8986836 we think the cricket will be pretty significant this year because its a huge volume of programming
8986837 and the resolution is almost better than if you were there yourself the intensity of it

8986855 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
8986856 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
8986857 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
8986858 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
8986859 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
8986860 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
8986861 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
8986862 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
8986863 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
8986864 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
8986865 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
8986866 not only do i want an elite president i want someone whos embarrassingly superior to me
8986867 weve never seen anything like this none of us have and i can just imagine what our friend tim would be saying right now
8986868 my roommate lynn is one of the nicest people i know in dc she is always smiling and happy even when she is helping out with mundane household chores like taking out the trash washing dishes etc beyond being an awesome roommate she is also a very good friend we can hang out at happy hour just as easily as we can chill in the apt and make it a movie night but perhaps most importantly lynn is the coolest roommate because she puts up with me in the mornings when i am semi awake and usually not a morning person and manages to make me smile everyday while walking to work although she is moving out soon i just wanted to let her know that i have appreciated all the times that weve stayed up late chit chatting and the many summer adventures that weve had in the city
8986869 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
8986870 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
8986871 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
8986872 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
8986873 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
8986874 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
8986875 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband
8986876 and then youre good to go you dont have to worry about that
8986877 a very very small number of people would have purchased tickets for travel in september or thereafter before the flights were taken out of the fall schedule in may and june of this year
8986878 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont hike base airfares
8986879 i dont think most people in every aspect of their trip will notice a difference
8986880 if there is a silver lining it may be that as a result of fewer overall operations they may see better on time performance
8986881 it is not a merger investigation and has no specific deadline
8986882 the proposals would create a monster monopoly which would mean that ba aa and iberia would be way too dominant on key routes into and out of heathrow airport
8986883 we all know that monopolies never work in the consumers favor
8986884 when you have monetary tightening you do get lower growth that was expected
8986885 but its not terribly low 7 9 percent is still high by historical standards
8986886 our economy must grow at the rate of at least ten per cent every year to get rid of poverty and generate employment for all
8986887 until we can achieve those reforms 10 percent remains an unattainable target
8986888 like those prisoners put loved ones on the wall but jakes was heath ledger
8986889 its becoming more common to see families committing to driving less
8986890 i think its a part of the market that will continue to grow as gas gets more expensive
8986891 living out in the suburbs just isnt a big deal anymore
8986892 people want to live work and go to school within a six blocks radius thats changing the way they look at property
8986893 for people who want to drive less it just makes sense that theyd be looking for different things in a neighborhood
8986894 kirsten was able to see things about places we were looking that i dont think a normal agent would have noticed
8986895 youre going to want to look at streets with low traffic volume
8986896 i saw the yard and the garage and i said i have to buy this house
8986897 this is a hard job to do on a bike
8986898 you have to get the right people and the day has to be nice you have to be looking at property in the same couple mile location
8986899 if youre meeting someone on location youre not exactly business presentable when you show up dripping with sweat
8986900 if they dont want a sweaty realtor then maybe they want someone else
8986901 most people dont care the last clients i took out bought an 800 000 house they arent exactly poor people living off the earth
8986902 weve been able to pick things that offer the biggest value
8986903 a strong indication of the macro environment getting a lot worse
8986904 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8986905 if juan que mccain desea tener un discusi n sobre qui n tiene el temperamento y juicio servir como el comandante en jefe siguiente thats un discusi n im listo a have
8986906 it was all i could do to hold on to myself
8986907 the play is the story of the movement and survivors talking about what went wrong
8986908 the usual thought is my god i would never have done that those people must have been very different from me
8986909 it would have been a huge mistake if id won instead she deserved it
8986910 that time in your life youve been preparing for your whole career finally arrives and you just step up to the plate
8986911 i was in wicked and happy and i told tracy im loving this and having a ball
8986912 he bugged me and then he bugged other people to bug me he said he wrote it for me and no one else could play her and i said tracy thats hyperbole and hed say its not
8986913 while it seemed such a rondi reed part there was this turn for her in the last scene this revealing moment about the secrets in her life
8986914 i remember going with moira harris and kevin anderson to see john malkovich in the killing fields and you would have thought we were his parents we were so thrilled
8986915 but it got to where youd go to a steppenwolf function and a donor would come up and say nonchalantly oh hi great to see you and then enthusiastically ask whens john malkovich coming back
8986916 it seemed we had the same six people in every play and wed look at each other onstage thinking what are we doing together yet again
8986917 in a lot of ways they were ahead of me and it took me time to come to grips with what i needed to do to get better
8986918 but to work in plays back to back to back for 15 years you do get better that was the luxury steppenwolf afforded me
8986919 the school was putting on an operetta based on johnny appleseed and i was told i could be in it if i could produce a pioneer bonnet
8986920 my mother said she neither had one nor was willing to make one so i rummaged through closets found an outfit of my sisters that had a matching bonnet and wound up in the front row of the production
8986921 i tried out for everything especially musicals even though i couldnt read music and wasnt a great singer
8986922 wed rehearse until 4 a m blowing off history or other classes theater was all we cared about
8986923 shes the den mother the one who brings treats to rehearsal
8986924 she has a maternal rooted quality shes a real anchor
8986925 shes sometimes a hair larger than life sure but ill never forget the moment in august when she yelled at the top of her lungs im not arguing
8986926 onstage she injects these wonderful details that come from trusting herself
8986927 the other night the monocle she wears got caught up and sort of flipped into the air and she instantly made that screw up hilarious nothing throws her
8986928 everybody stops by to chat tell their stories and tell their troubles
8986929 but she has such a great time in wicked too shes like the belle of the ball
8986930 the headiness of the whole experience was off the charts
8986931 we did something in chicago that no show has ever done before
8986932 this show has changed the way new york producers view chicago it is now a city not just for tours but for extended runs
8986933 but were not going to change course we want to go out with a bang
8986934 this show has meant a whole lot to the theater district and to our business
8986935 wicked has brought us a unique clientele and a lot of people who frankly had never been to the loop before
8986936 half of the audience for wicked has been visitors to the city and 85 percent of them have cited the show as their main reason for coming to chicago
8986937 we always face the need to give people a compelling reason to come to chicago again
8986938 in england they have peter pan and in america we have the wizard of oz wicked tapped into what friendship means and what its like to be an outsider in a most visceral kind of way im very jealous
8986939 we have shows standing in line for runs that chicago has never seen before

8986988 i am standing by him 100 and give him my full support in hope that his time in rehab will help him to come home feeling stronger and better
8986989 we are obviously having some personal difficulties but it is at these times we get stronger and we plan to work through any problems together and look forward to being a happy family with our son sebastian
8986990 i am personally very insulted and annoyed at your suggestion that howard stern kept sanjaya on the show
8986991 this pisses me off he thinks he can just get a former beauty queen and well vote for him with two years experience this is crap he blew it hes trying to pander to us and he blew it in a big way
8986992 hay una serie de eventos que vienen ocurriendo que apuntan hacia a un campa a para intentar criminalizar nuestras luchas por esto es necesario hacer un llamado de atenci n al gobierno nacional para que analicen lo que est ocurriendo e investiguen a funcionarios involucrados y cese la criminalizaci n y los juicios contra trabajadores dirigentes y dem s ciudadanos que reclaman y defienden sus derechos hay que impulsar una campa a en defensa de los derechos de los que luchan
8986993 si vemos los hechos del conflicto de los yupkas donde hubo una fuerte represi n por parte de la guardia nacional y la detenci n de periodistas de medios comunitarios la represi n que se ha desatado contra trabajadores que han ocupado fabricas como son los casos de sanitarios maracay y sincreba en m rida o lo que vimos contra los sidoristas durante su justa lucha para un contrato colectivo digno y la nacionalizaci n y los casos de dirigentes obreros en distintos partes del pa s que est n frente juicios como los de fundimeca simplemente por defender los derechos de los trabajadores podemos ver como la derecha est usando su control sobre partes de instituciones del estado sea la guardia nacional o sea los tribunales para intentar criminalizar nuestras luchas
8986994 en todos estos casos vemos que luego de 10 a os de revoluci n todav a quedan pendiente muchas tareas y una de ellas es la depuraci n de las instituciones del estado
8986995 hace por lo menos 7 a os que este pueblo ind gena est enfrentando las mafias y sicarios de los terratenientes quienes tomaron por la fuerza sus tierras hace 30 a os atr s
8986996 si no fuera por la campa a de los medios alternativos como aporrea donde se ha denunciado la represi n brutal en contra de estudiantes y periodistas que fueron a apoyar a los yupkas la detenci n de cuarto de ellos por la guardia nacional y el cerco alrededor de la comunidad yupka limitando acceso a los que vinieron a apoyarlos todav a este caso no hubiera salido a ver la luz del d a
8986997 otra vez como fue el caso de la lucha de los sidoristas contra la represi n de la guardia nacional fue el presidente hugo ch vez en su ultimo alo presidente el que se puso a frente para denunciar que las cosa no pueden seguir como estaban hasta ahora cabe preguntar por qu dado el claro papel nefasto de estos terratenientes en colaboraci n con oficiales de la guardia nacional el inti y otras instituciones del estado ninguna otra persona del gobierno y de las otras instituciones del estado ll mase asamblea nacional o ministerio p blico sali a denunciar todo esto
8986998 este es otro ejemplo donde a las claras se demuestra que aun todav a dentro el estado revolucionario existen muchos escu lidos y contrarrevolucionarios que en conchupancia con patronos enfrentan y enjuician a los trabajadores
8986999 no es el nico caso de intentos a criminalizar los que claramente son conflictos laborales por eso es necesario impulsar un campa a conjunto con todos los corrientes que hacen vida en el movimiento sindical junto con las organizaciones sociales para defender todos estos compa eros y compa eros sea los yupkas o los de fundimeca u otra empresa
8987000 este campa a tiene que levantar los reclamos en estos caso con una sola voz para denunciar los intentos a criminalizar estas luchas y es m s tiene que jugar un papel fundamental e impulsando la depuraci n del estado venezolano

8987051 the goal is to ensure her wrist recovers to its original strength but at the same time the focus will also be towards optimising her overall physical fitness

8987110 but all of them without exception are finding operating conditions a big surprise
8987111 if anything the new zealand economy has run stronger for longer than expected as the reporting season progressed it seems to have got better
8987112 you cannot look broadly at the new zealand market now and say that overall conditions are tough out there and therefore companies are being impacted
8987113 the outlook was not robust but it certainly gave investors comfort that the company is in a good state to withstand the downturn in the domestic economy
8987114 over the next six months the independent markets should start to decouple the synchronisation with the global shock
8987115 it makes you think spend more time with your kids
8987116 there is such rivalry on the field but they drop all that

8987127 it was quite hard especially for a person coming from a country with a different language

8987157 i have spoken to fabio capello about the situation he asked me how steven was and it was a good conversation everything was positive between us and i have explained to him the timing and when he will be fit

8987160 the adversity that came toward me this year started in spring training and never quit it just pounded me all year
8987161 it was a dream come true and my life turned 180 degrees in one night
8987162 i think sometimes when things arent working at this level teams really can make you pay
8987163 but at the same time when it turns around and it clicks it can be pretty good
8987164 i cant say i blame them if they dont bring me back up this year because i didnt do what i had to do this year
8987165 the way we view him and how we value him hasnt changed
8987166 the biggest thing for a player is to learn what their abilities are and what are their limits and to make the adjustments with the lines
8987167 for all his struggles hes had this year hes actually a better pitcher than he was last year
8987168 its a matter of believing you can succeed at that level
8987169 i just didnt believe i was going to succeed every time i went out in the big leagues its hard to go out there and succeed if you dont believe youre going to

8987172 we gather here today to remember those who fought in what sometimes has been referred to as the forgotten war
8987173 but let me assure you the sacrifices of those brave soldiers sailors airmen and marines are not forgotten
8987174 horrific battle with the chinese communist forces near the village of shindong ni
8987175 today we once again honor their memory whether they still rest in korea and remain achingly unaccounted for or whether they returned home decades ago
8987176 the bible says that rain is heavens tears that being so it is notable that gods tears are falling on us today
8987177 but we should see these as tears of joy first because 50 years ago god called home these two soldiers second because the remains of these soldiers are also finally going home
8987178 a nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honors the men it remembers
8987179 killed in action body not recovered since the korean war
8987180 it is fitting on the 48th anniversary of the signing of the armistice that this service member is finally going home remarked brig
8987181 may we never forget these sacrifices made on behalf of freedom
8987182 we know that he was either a pilot or an aircrew member said callahan

8987193 as we prepare for the worst we must pray for the best
8987194 memas primary concern is for the safety of all mississippi residents
8987195 but with so many people living in low lying areas these residents need to understand that this housing may be susceptible to flooding in a situation like this
8987196 i wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast for i intend to go in harms way
8987197 countdown is a unique show with a very loyal audience and for that reason i felt that they needed someone who was part of the countdown family like jo brand it was great to be asked but i was worried i would fail the physical
8987198 a good deal of time has been taken up mulling over my countdown conundrum an approach to host the programme came as much as a surprise to me as to anyone else
8987199 my reaction was rather as one would have felt a year or two ago about a proposition from anna nicole smith while im not yet as old as the previous incumbent i cant help wondering what it would be like
8987200 it was only the end of july when des announced he was leaving nothing has moved on these things take time and we will make an announcement about the host in due time
8987201 our point is that if judicial commission is made then retired hindu and muslim judges should be there if the commission decides that they are culprit and they have proof of it then we will accept it then they police and investigating team can file a case in the court but because we have lost faith on government and its intelligence agencies so we are not ready to accept it we are not in favour of simi but surely we favour those innocents who are being arrested in the name of simi
8987202 all the members of the state legislative assembly and legislative council would give their one months salary towards the rescue and relief work
8987203 i met prime minister home minister and cabinet secretary i have told them that there are people in the affected areas who need immediate help they need to press all the forces into action the prime minister has given directives to the cabinet secretary to take action

8987209 teacher contract impasses have declined primarily because school districts and employee organizations were prescient enough to enter into multi year agreements during a period of relatively stable prices financial markets and budgets

8987211 we came here in good spirits following the last race but its been quite a frustrating day for us we worked closely with bridgestone throughout both sessions to find improved confidence in the front end of my machine yet weve ended the day in only 17th place the bike feels very nervous particularly in the bumpy sections of the circuit which means i just cant get hard on the brakes and into the turns our set up from brno just isnt working here so we need to revise our direction to suit this circuit and hopefully as we did last time out we can make a big improvement tomorrow
8987212 to be sidelined by something so simple is really disappointing but while the injury isnt serious it is really painful especially when youre on the bike i thought i was back to full fitness after resting up since brno but then i managed to tweak the same intercostal muscle during a light training session on thursday evening and the pain kept me awake most of the night the injury has responded well to treatment and is now much improved but the lack of sleep meant that it was difficult to concentrate fully ahead of this afternoons practice session rather than risk further injury by riding at less than 100 percent together with the team i made the decision to sit out this afternoons practice tomorrow ill be good to go and i hope that the lack of track time today wont stop us picking up where we left off at the last round
8987213 today we made the decision for john not to ride as an injury he sustained at brno which seemed to be healing well has caused him a tremendous amount of discomfort in the last few days although the treatment seems to be going well hes had very little sleep and we felt it would be too much of a risk to let him out on track particularly as hes still recovering from the recent surgery on his leg injuries its a difficult decision to make particularly because he also missed the post race test last time out but we hope that tomorrow he will be fit enough to ride anthony is struggling with a lack of front end confidence today and we have to look closely at how we can make radical improvements to his set up after his impressive race performance last time out in brno its disappointing to see him at the bottom of the timesheet once again
8987214 since my recent arrival at bioxel i have already been able to fully appreciate the strengths and tremendous potential of the corporation the quality of work achieved to date has placed bioxel in a more than promising growth stage position as compared to its competitors bioxels assets are significant and appreciated by its customers indeed the progress achieved so far by bioxel allows us to consolidate and offer fundamental elements to anticancer drug developers high quality pharmaceutical ingredients resulting from processes complying with good manufacturing practice pharmaceutical standards cgmp and produced in facilities successfully inspected by the food and drug administration fda sound intellectual property giving clients the right to use docetaxel without infringing patents protecting the synthetic processes of the active ingredient of sanofi aventis taxotere r an important quantity already available of 9 dhb the intermediate we use to synthesize docetaxel allowing immediate support to our clients for the launch of a docetaxel based product long term supply of paclitaxel and docetaxel thanks to abundant canadian yew resource areas we have access to to my knowledge bioxel is the only company that can claim all such assets

8987226 an uncertain revolution why the rise of a genetic model of mental illness has not increased tolerance
8987227 in the case of schizophrenia genetic arguments are associated with fears regarding violence
8987228 in fact attributing schizophrenia to genes is no different from attributing it to bad character either way americans see those with schizophrenia as damaged in some essential way and therefore likely to be violent however when applied to depression genetic arguments have very different connotations they are associated with social acceptance if you imagine that someones depression is a genetic problem the condition seems more real and less blameworthy its in their genes theyre not weak so i should accept them for who they are
8987229 while the stigma surrounding mental illness has not diminished the rate of treatment for psychiatric disorders has increased
8987230 the culture surrounding mental illness has become more treatment focused with direct to consumer advertising of psychiatric medications now a mainstay of popular media

8987236 the truth is that the choice is not between a dead mechanism and a rigid automatism on the one hand and conscious planning on the other hand the alternative is not plan or no plan the question is whose planning should each member of society plan for himself or should the paternal government alone plan for all the issue is not automatism versus conscious action it is spontaneous action of each individual versus the exclusive action of the government it is freedom versus government omnipotence

8987242 the georgian move against south ossetia was motivated by political considerations having to do with israel and iran according to nfc georgian president mikheil saakashvili decided to assert control over the breakaway region in order to force israel to reconsider its decision to cut back its support for georgias military
8987243 russian and georgian media reported several days ago that israel decided to stop its support for georgia after moscow made it clear to jerusalem and washington that russia would respond to continued aid for georgia by selling advanced anti aircraft systems to syria and iran

8987261 working in a facility this size has the advantage of getting to know the people in the organization when you walk through the halls or need to coordinate a program its easy to get things accomplished because you know the personnel or they recognize you and what department you work in there is an overall willingness to help the mission of the childrens medical center and its focus is caring for the children of the miami valley and being their advocates the employees at childrens are truly dedicated to their mission and to the children and it shows this dedication is the main reason why it is great to work at the childrens medical center
8987262 childrens is perfect for me the philosophy in the emergency department is say yes when you can and no when you have to i am practicing the kind of nursing here that i thought was a lost art we are striving to meet all the needs of the patient from medical to spiritual as well as the needs of the family it is a work environment where the bottom line is the excellent care we deliver i go home at night feeling that i have made a positive contribution to a very worthy cause this is a refreshing feeling for a 20 year emergency department veteran who has been with childrens for the last three years
8987263 caring for kids is what we do best at childrens we are committed to providing quality care education and customer service we make a difference in their lives and that is what it is all about
8987264 i love working at childrens because of the team approach used in the area that i work in this area the patients and families have to interact with almost every department in the hospital to prevent too much confusion and to aid in more patient centered care a team of disciplines come together to discuss total patient care everyone on the team including the patient is just as important as everyone else i feel this approach works well
8987265 the atmosphere here at childrens is so conducive to children that it flows throughout the organization and makes it such a fun place to work everyone here is so focused on the patient and family needs which is what i went into nursing to do here in the emergency department we are so fortunate to have tremendous educational support which keeps all of the staff updated and competent
8987266 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons

8987270 that meant very much to me and seemed to be received so beautifully by the public and the world you know i enjoyed it very much
8987271 what did they do to those people to get them to speak in front of 70 000 people
8987272 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
8987273 is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
8987274 over the last two decades in the united sates even while flu vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality
8987275 further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
8987276 previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias

8987399 fortunately we got a call from the un people to do a concert
8987400 at that time kenya was really rough a lot of things were going on
8987401 so i been there and see the condition and situation in which people were being put against people and i thought about their leaders not only in kenya but in africa
8987402 the past is not going to bring anything into the present
8987403 so that inspired me to do the song one africa
8987404 in this country once you decide to work honestly and to do the right thing
8987405 son b sicamente como mis hermanos siempre tendr n mi respaldo no importa en qu situaci n son tipos hilarantes cada uno ellos tiene realmente un gran coraz n personas as no se ven todos los d as los puedes ver en videos y cosas por el estilo pero son diez veces m s geniales de lo que esperas cuando los encuentras y compartes con ellos todo el tiempo y ellos me protegen mucho
8987406 if they had gone any further in their analysis they would have had to account for the massive quantity of evidence for the demolition of these two towers
8987407 plane debris sliced through the utility shafts at the north towers core creating a conduit for burning jet fuel and fiery destruction throughout the building
8987408 a view of how the world works that mistakenly empowers particular and evil forces with the ability to determine the course of events and it misses the messiness and contingency with which life actually unfolds
8987409 you know the american people will swallow that we have got the newspapers and the dumb american people will fall for it in a second
8987410 it has slaughtered the little and allowed the big to escape the big shots werent even called to testify they were all mentioned in my testimony why was all mention of these names suppressed from the testimony
8987411 its hard for the mind to reject rational forensic evidence which agrees with logic thats science based
8987412 i along with many others are treated as conspiracy theorists basically because people arent ready to look at this stuff seriously but once you get the evidence in front of them its a whole different thing
8987413 people just dont want to know it they dont want to know how bad things are and accepting that 9 11 was an inside job is just way too horrendous for a lot of people to seriously consider they dont approach it rationally they approach it emotionally that in terms of the implications of what youre presenting is too scary
8987414 if youre a soul of the world its hard to live in one place
8987415 youre too busy doing your own music to be inspired by someone else
8987416 i wanted youth novels to be like youre reading someones diary
8987417 ive always written a lot of pop songs but it just wasnt what i was interested in doing before
8987418 i always shoved those songs to the back of the pile different experiences and different people that you meet that changes your work you know i probably couldnt have made this record five years ago but i probably could have made something similar i didnt want to
8987419 i listen to a lot of weird experimental stuff but i also listen to a lot of the rolling stones and the kinks i wanted to make something that was part of a lineage that was important to me including punk and including jangle pop
8987420 i felt like i was letting influences out that i wasnt even aware of
8987421 i wrote this film after learning about women smugglers at the border of new york state and canada who drive their cars across the frozen st lawrence river to make money to support their kids the risk involved compelled me to write a story not only about smuggling at the northern border but also about what life circumstances would lead someone to take such chances
8987422 data usage that is not characteristic of a typical residential user of the service
8987423 if comcast has oversold its network to the point of creating congestion problems then well disclosed caps for internet use are a better short term solution than comcasts current practice of illegally blocking internet traffic but in the long term congestion should be treated as a temporary problem one that is managed without discrimination
8987424 its a very public phenomenon these sex changes are legal and embraced by the legal clerics im very interested in gender issues so this fascinated me i find it interesting what makes people male or female here are individuals who are living in a very traditional culture and theyre on the margins i thought it would be a good way to see how gender is viewed overall through the people who dont fit in
8987425 because its legal and totally embraced i did it all in the open i applied for a press permit after a month i was given the okay officially i was allowed to do what i needed to do the rest is what you have with any doc talking to people and forming relationships gaining their trust its about putting in the time loitering really
8987426 thats something that upper and middle class people might think of but for the poor and those who live in rural areas its not even in their consciousness its not like they have relatives in switzerland or france they could stay with or anything
8987427 if youre poor this is when the conformity is really expected of you there was one man who had the operation but even after that his family rejected him they lived outside of the city and for them they simply couldnt even imagine the idea of someone having this done they told him the day he had the operation he was dead to them it was heartbreaking to see this person do this and then be on his own in an environment where the family is really the rock of your existence its not like the west where youre supposed to step out on your own and make something of yourself
8987428 she called to say that she and her boyfriend got married she was very excited she said theyre getting an apartment together and that she has a dowry now and a pre nuptial agreement she was very excited
8987429 spooking the terrible town on a hideous hill a crooked road leads to it from a black buzzing bog climbing up in sharp zigzagging turns over dizzying drops to the summit where endless headstones appear vanishing into the distant gloom beyond this ancient cemetery the cracked avenues of spooking begin dark and oppressive lined with huge overhanging maples and oaks in their shadow crumbling residences loom drafty old mansions standing impossibly against the onslaught of time
8987430 a spirited young spooking lady with a taste for mystery a thirst for adventure and an eye for the inscrutable

8987444 i would just imagine that this man who is certainly quite an actor is quite good at putting together this web of lies i imagine he saw that on the internet why would he choose me to be his mother
8987445 he could see these facts and get the information from these facts that he needed to his pretending and if i was dead there would be no one to deny what he was saying
8987446 it is not a merger investigation and has no specific deadline
8987447 the proposals would create a monster monopoly which would mean that ba aa and iberia would be way too dominant on key routes into and out of heathrow airport
8987448 we all know that monopolies never work in the consumers favor
8987449 its very disappointing that we werent able to play to more about nine percent of last years business to our regular paid customers that they didnt have enough confidence that even without the ski show that we would have a really good show and i guess that i grossly underestimated the power of the ski show
8987450 as i told our staff last night at our annual year end banquet of all the 41 years that ive been here this staff absolutely brought me more joy and pride than any other year because they learned a tremendous lesson in adversity it was very difficult for them to come to work every single day when youre doing such a small percentage of your normal business
8987451 we allocated an additional 300 000 to get the message out the perception was that the entire community had been affected and so we spent two weeks on all sorts of media radio television internet making sure visitors in our market knew that wisconsin dells was in fact open for business

8987457 apple has made several tweaks to their ipod system since its launch in 2001 driven by technological development market forces and the needs of our consumers and gaming first parties are no different

8987459 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8987460 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8987461 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million americans how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8987462 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8987463 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain

8987481 that means that a younger person living close to the bombing site would be more likely to have adult onset thyroid cancer having ret ptc rearrangements
8987482 it could be either by direct dna damage or by other pathways such as a result of radiation induced genomic instability

8987609 we have serious reason to believe that american citizens were right at the heart of the military action this would have implications for american domestic policy
8987610 if this is confirmed then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8987611 and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8987612 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8987613 therefore they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8987614 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in inter ethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over

8987677 de rechter heeft duidelijk aangegeven dat de inhoud van de teksten op een site de verantwoordelijkheid blijven van de beheerder
8987678 belangrijk is wel welke signatuur de site heeft de beheerder had zelf ook teksten met negatieve berichtgeving over moslims geplaatst en links naar extremistische sites hij kon daarom verwachten dat er strafbare teksten op de site werden geplaatst en dat had hij moeten aanpakken
8987679 de website is enige tijd actief beheerd door mijn cli nt op een gegeven moment kreeg hij het te druk met andere bezigheden waardoor hij het toezicht moest stoppen hij kwam er pas achter dat er iets mis was toen hij werd opgepakt de schrijvers van de teksten zijn op hun beurt helemaal niet door justitie vervolgd

8987765 mommy you can have a party or get a good nights rest while im at school
8987766 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8987767 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8987768 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8987769 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8987770 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8987771 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8987772 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8987773 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8987774 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8987775 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8987776 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8987777 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8987778 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
8987779 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8987780 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8987781 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read y our speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
8987782 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8987783 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
8987784 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8987785 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8987786 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8987787 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8987788 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8987789 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8987790 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8987791 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8987792 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8987793 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8987794 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8987795 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8987796 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8987797 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8987798 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8987799 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8987800 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8987801 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8987802 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8987803 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8987804 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8987805 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8987806 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8987807 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8987808 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8987809 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8987810 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8987811 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8987812 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8987813 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8987814 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8987815 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
8987816 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had
8987817 michael ballack sustained a foot injury in the game versus portsmouth on august 17th
8987818 despite an incomplete recovery michael was determined to play against wigan on august 24th unfortunately since this game he has not been able to train full recovery will take approximately two weeks
8987819 i am not sure what 300 mhz of cpu can do these days but 1500 count me out i am sticking to my nokia n810
8987820 also given the level of miniaturisation that went into the macbook air motherboard i cant say whether the space cubes achievement is that impressive its just cute
8987821 i would buy it for 30 let alone 1 500 are these people mad
8987822 for those saying they wouldnt pay 30 for it did you not read the article this computer is not designed for consumers its designed to go into space sending anything into space costs between 10 000 and 20 000 per kilogram when the cost of launch is built in this device is a bargain at 1 500 because it saves far more than 1 500 in launch costs anyway why should it surprise anyone that a computer built for use in space is expensive
8987823 yes ebay should be made to take all data storage devices for sale on its site and check them for residual sensitive data and then if found apply military grade formatting of the drives to completely erase it all before passing the device on to the buyer
8987824 as a natwest customer im naturally concerned about whether my data was included on that computer it is appalling that so much data seems to be incapable of remaining under lock and key a serious review of it policy across not just government but businesses as well should be a matter of priority this could be construed as a blatant breach of the data protection act and to that end legal action should be taken
8987825 natwest should find out why this laptop was not cleaned down securely prior to its disposal and sack the person responsible gross negligence if ever i saw it
8987826 im asleep before hes even started filming a box office smash is unlikely
8987827 its bad enough having to use the silly site for those that seem incapable of communicating in any other form let alone watch a movie about how it came about major snore
8987828 they were going to make a film about boo coms infamous demise but realised that shakespeare had already done hubris and danny de vito had done other peoples money
8987829 its big drama its little drama lip gloss stains on my dick from lil mama

8987835 its 25 cents a day but if you have three kids over a week thats the price of a gallon of milk
8987836 truth or consequence say it aloud use that evidence race it around
8987837 among the most obvious benefits of sitting down and playing a good old fashioned game with your children is the opportunity that games provide to apply and solidify the mathematical reasoning and calculating skills your children are learning in school
8987838 play engages the prefrontal cortex feeding our highest cognitive functions play improves our ability to reason and to understand the world
8987839 one of the easiest and most inexpensive ways to improve preschool mathematics curriculum especially for low income children is to
8987840 they have been told to be ready to cut off supplies as soon as monday
8987841 i have always been driven to the desert i think the landscape itself influences people in a certain way
8987842 we experienced the desert and the sun and the extreme cold in the desert to the nonstop rain in oregon i think the weather and the landscape also influences the character
8987843 this is the exploration of the mystery of a woman called sylvia who has an emotional journey that takes her to the extremes it explores what makes her so damaged
8987844 you should ask people that question why are people so flawed because thats who we are
8987845 why is it when you watch a film and something happens that moves you it either moves you to tears or gives a chill down your spine its because we can see ourselves in that moment
8987846 democrats get lift from convention now its republicans turn to soar
8987847 the farmer in question has done everything by the book he has done nothing wrong
8987848 most of europe is now in a bluetongue protection zone so in many ways it is treated as one disease unit
8987849 as long as youve vaccinated your stock you have nothing to fear
8987850 if importers must bring in stock they should not accept word of mouth affirmation from suppliers that the animals carry no bluetongue risk and protect their reputations and their own cattle by insisting on a vaccination certificate that has been signed by a vet
8987851 but because of the state of the uk dairy industry there arent many dairy heifers around on the market so people are being forced to go further afield

8987883 he appears to know right from the start what quantities he wishes to express but reciting the number series seems to be his only means of retrieving the corresponding word
8987884 if you want to make sure the math that children are learning is meaningful you have to know something about how the brain represents number at the kind of level that stan is trying to understand
8987885 it is a basic structural property of how our brains represent number not just a lack of facility
8987886 i remember very well sitting and reading this paper and then debating it with jacques mehler my ph d adviser
8987887 it was very strange to find that some of the most exciting results of the budding cognitive neuroscience field were coming out of this small place the only place where i ever saw sixty year old hippies sitting around in tie dyed shirts
8987888 we tried to map the whole parietal lobe in a half hour by having the subject perform functions like moving the eyes and hands pointing with fingers grasping an object engaging in various language tasks and of course making small calculations like thirteen minus four we found there was a beautiful geometrical organization to the areas that were activated the eye movements were at the back the hand movements were in the middle grasping was in the front and so on and right in the middle we were able to confirm was an area that cared about number
8987889 some people believe that psychology is just being replaced by brain imaging but i dont think thats the case at all
8987890 we need psychology to refine our idea of what the imagery is going to show us thats why we do behavioral experiments see patients its the confrontation of all these different methods that creates knowledge
8987891 basically we can derive the behavioral properties of these neurons from first principles
8987892 its become a whole industry now to see how we associate number to space and space to number
8987893 and were finding the association goes very very deep in the brain
8987894 two three is one four is two five is three six is four six
8987895 give a calculator to a five year old and you will teach him how to make friends with numbers instead of despising them
8987896 the idea that all children are different and that they need to discover things their own way i dont buy it at all
8987897 i believe there is one brain organization we see it in babies we see it in adults basically with a few variations were all travelling on the same road
8987898 thats what were trying to get back to in france
8987899 they know for example that fifty plus thirty is going to be larger than sixty
8987900 of course they do not know this verbally and have no way of talking about it but when we showed them the relevant sets and transformations they immediately got it
8987901 thats a beautiful little fact but i dont think its coded in our brains any longer

8987906 it makes me more proud im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk

8987930 i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics

8987955 not only is this a major step forward in scientific understanding of a fundamental process in biology but it paves the way for the development of new drugs against bacteria
8987956 it is vital to the bacteria that the channel fully closes and only opens at the right times as mistakes either way would be fatal
8987957 new chemicals designed to force channels to stay open or shut are likely to kill or at the very least greatly slow down the growth of bacteria
8987958 slowing down the growth gives the bodys natural defences time to tackle its bacterial invader
8987959 saying that you did the wrong thing in the right way isnt enough
8987960 will give us leverage in the congress and in the appointment of the next faa administrator
8987961 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it
8987962 they dont drink cuss or chew or go with those who do
8987963 for the flesh lusts against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary to one another so that you do not do the things that you wish
8987964 i just found out late last night that a bid had been accepted
8987965 so i came down last night and had a medical this morning and im delighted
8987966 ive been happy at the club on the field its been going well but i knew offers had come in through the summer i thought the best thing for me to do was that ask for a move
8987967 everything with the manager is fine but there were certain issues at the club i was looking for a move up in the contract to reflect the offers put in that were rejected
8987968 obviously the club decided to accept the request and sell me on
8987969 there was nothing from me saying im worth this to the club but i knew offers had come in over the summer and the clubs turned them down thats the clubs valuation and the players wages must reflect that value
8987970 it goes hand in hand but that chapter has gone
8987971 i enjoyed very much working with him it was fantastic and ive learned from him and enjoyed every minute playing for newcastle theyre a fantastic club
8987972 well reserve our rights on all of that and well make decisions as things evolve
8987973 low cost low quality journalism that fairfax management wishes to impose
8987974 not the hard news not the international news not the business sport local news that is not the part of the business that is being affected at all
8987975 its really quite mischievous of people to say that theres going to be a decline in the quality
8987976 the market for building products is becoming much more trans tasman anyway
8987977 we are looking offshore we are not just concentrating on new zealand
8987978 we are looking forward to the government opening up some of the offshore acreage because we would have a greater appetite for some of that
8987979 export growth may stall in the second half of the year in response the dollars recent rise
8987980 a fair bit of easing was already priced in with regard to the ecb and investors are now reconsidering their decisions to go short on the euro and long on the us dollar
8987981 the dollar has moved powerfully higher since it bottomed out against the major currencies and a respite is in order
8987982 the sharp decline in house prices persisted into august as weak buyer confidence and tight lending criteria continued to weigh on the market
8987983 the key thing is tracking where that moneys gone if there is something there great lets try and return some money to creditors we think its about 42 million plus anything else we can find
8987984 that level of uncertainty is a bit unusual and indicates that earnings have higher risk in terms of the accuracy of forecasts
8987985 the results show that the companies have done a pretty good job of guiding the market in terms of profit expectations
8987986 but all of them without exception are finding operating conditions a big surprise
8987987 if anything the new zealand economy has run stronger for longer than expected as the reporting season progressed it seems to have got better
8987988 you cannot look broadly at the new zealand market now and say that overall conditions are tough out there and therefore companies are being impacted
8987989 the outlook was not robust but it certainly gave investors comfort that the company is in a good state to withstand the downturn in the domestic economy
8987990 over the next six months the independent markets should start to decouple the synchronisation with the global shock
8987991 we are particularly concerned at the secondary scamming that seems to be going on vultures in the shape of lawyers and consultants circling and picking the investors bones clean
8987992 if youre coming out publicly with a white knight image you really must be clear about where youre coming from what you charge chances of success and the timeframe involved
8987993 here they are with their recovery roadshow tearing up and down the country asking people to cough up 120 and then telling people their own hardship stories thats not helping thats helping themselves
8987994 time is a luxury for many of these people this kind of interference is compounding their problems its all about revenge and reparation eufa is trying to become the gatekeeper when it clearly has no right
8987995 regrettably its when people are at their most vulnerable that they believe anything
8987996 if anyone wants to suggest that im somehow making a nest egg out of this then theyre welcome to and i hope they get their jollies out of it
8987997 the message has to be understood when times are tough you need lawyers to solve the problem im not sure eufa understand this protesting isnt going to get you anywhere the only way to get any comfort is through issuing proceedings
8987998 weve recovered some money sued lawyers were suing developers weve got injunctions and weve stopped mortgage payments that comes through use of the legal process
8987999 legal proceedings are very expensive being part of a group makes it affordable for people who have seemingly lost everything
8988000 isnt it better having one firm one group of barristers acting rather than 10 different barristers with 10 different ideas a nuclear attack instead of a shotgun approach
8988001 there was no one else out there lobbying on behalf of investors no one challenging a lack of progress lack of action for that matter by statutory organisations
8988002 not so long ago the securities commission came out and said dont worry we will monitor the likes of bridgecorp if the laws worked properly or these authorities had done their job better maybe some of this wouldnt have happened
8988003 within three weeks of showing him a picture i had something even better sitting in my workshop for about 20 000
8988004 you get higher wages here but you will spend more and there is more tax
8988005 we had looked everywhere and the lack of apprentice training in the late 80s and 90s hadnt helped
8988006 our international staff have a wonderful work ethic and add huge value to our existing culture
8988007 they are incredibly loyal the more you give the more they give
8988008 its important to make the most of people coming here and who do want to be here
8988009 new zealand is already competing with australia advertising mining jobs in the paper
8988010 we are not a recruitment agency but our business is to help small businesses so if they cant get the right workforce then its our business
8988011 the majority of people who first come to new zealand even from england or south africa say it can be difficult to fit in with their employer it may be even things like the time of day you start work whether you are expected to go out to dinner with your boss and how you address them
8988012 it was quite hard especially for a person coming from a country with a different language
8988013 not all of the kiwis accept a person like me but i was fortunate to meet my previous boss
8988014 we would have never got to where we are now without icehouse
8988015 we believe land should be owned by new zealand citizens and residents only and our laws should be changed to say that we welcome ex pats coming home and people coming to this country to live but why should we allow singaporean australian or american speculators to buy investment properties in our country shutting first time home buyers from the market
8988016 i dont think there are hundreds of people just buying up new zealand we do sell houses to overseas buyers but it isnt a big deal the percentage is very minimal the people ive been dealing with recently tend to be first home buyers and people moving to hamilton from other parts of the country
8988017 the report makes it sound like new zealand is for sale but it isnt undoubtedly there is a number of overseas buyers looking after all its the only way they can look at a property looking at real estate is escapist thats why we have so much traffic people go online just to look sometimes its not like a bank website where you have to use it
8988018 on an average month our site gets around 270 000 unique visitors for the waikato in an average month around 370 000 pages are viewed about 12 000 pages viewed per day the waikato is the region of the country that has the lowest ratio of international visitors just 17 per cent the top region for international traffic is nelson bays with 39 per cent of all visitors from outside new zealand

8988062 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines
8988063 dan holt and ian macgregor have also shown excellent form lately so they have to be protected up to one point too

8988067 joe needs to be active in the early part of the race and if any break goes he will need to be there for phil this is his first race with the team after his surgery so he will be helping the guys from the beginning until the end

8988109 in such situations russian diplomats will have to leave georgia
8988110 would be very awkward to have a diplomatic relationship with russia when russia will be setting up diplomatic relations with south ossetia and abkhazia

8988166 its the same all over new zealand native forests are under threat from so many different pressures they need peoples interventions to protect them
8988167 mt pirongia really gets into your heart there is someone who has lived in australia for 20 years and ive been told that the first thing they think every morning about is mt pirongia
8988168 we chose that is because were not keen to use 1080

8988170 you know what youve actually achieved that way and its also a motivator for your volunteers

8988179 you go through the list of borrowing and tell us which is frivolous
8988180 we have an icebergs hope in hell of getting 1 4 million from the government and you know that if you went through it with a comb you couldnt get it below 6 million so dont criticise our debt accumulation
8988181 we need to support one another and you are belittling the contribution we are all trying to make
8988182 its a shame because you could be a great mentor to us but its scary to say anything to you for fear of it being misconstrued in the public arena

8988191 were concerned about the anti competitive effect of certain linkages between advertisers and other issues
8988192 assignments have been given out and a lot of work is getting done its a challenge to meet the tight deadlines that have been given
8988193 the states have the benefit of arrangement with the doj but they also have the burden of it
8988194 the parties made it known they had a certain time frame and we are sensitive to those timeframes
8988195 i first heard it at age 14 when i saw a family become homeless and i knew i was supposed to help
8988196 i had no idea there was such a job i just knew i was supposed to help people thats stuck with me and i feel blessed to be able to do it
8988197 thats something i stumbled across 16 years ago when i built a facility for homeless women and children
8988198 this was in orange and we were told we were in a historic district and we had to build a historic building so we built a beautiful craftsman style home
8988199 it immediately built peoples self esteem and inspired a different mindset
8988200 we thought it was such a big opportunity we wanted to work with the city and the community
8988201 it was government funded and when the government wanted us to do something we had to do it whether it was good or bad for the community we were serving
8988202 one of the ways we stay flexible is we never borrow money
8988203 the village of hope was a 14 year project and about two years ago i was under a lot of pressure to take out a loan to finish it
8988204 im asking people to donate their dollars to us but theyve already paid their taxes so i dont want our students to double dip from them
8988205 on a more practical basis we studied which programs worked well and found that the ones that allowed their clients to keep their welfare checks had a lot of people returning to the streets and drugs and alcohol with money in their pocket their addiction was a mere phone call away
8988206 because were providing the services at no cost our focus is to find a way for students to give back
8988207 this way their reaction to free services doesnt become welfare oriented students also learn valuable self sufficiency and job skills
8988208 it also builds their self esteem right away they feel theyre earning their keep so to speak
8988209 because we have all of these formerly homeless people that need a job and a home
8988210 the homeless population today is so much different than when i started in this field 16 years ago then it was mostly alcohol and drug related men
8988211 before crystal meth there werent a lot of women that were drug users but when crystal meth came around it ripped families apart
8988212 the problem was it killed you at the end of the process
8988213 women got sucked right out of families and right into the drug culture
8988214 theres not a man on this tour who could have gone through what i went through to be a golfer i still cant believe i went so long without breaking down or quitting the game i dont smile much and i never laugh its just something thats in me if youd been through what ive been through you wouldnt be smiling either

8988236 i have all sorts of theories on how to stack my dishwasher and if you are judgmental about ritalin for adhd or think such things are caused by too much sugar again deal break city
8988237 i hope she likes it here i sent the ad to one of my old sitters and she said she felt it was pretty accurate which sort of stung a little bit
8988238 i got a chance to step back see the whole story of the adventure that i had been on for 20 years with my sister for 47 years as a family and saw a great story thats what inspired the book
8988239 some may consider it betrayal of some kind i consider it my memoirs i cant tell my story without telling hers our lives are completely intertwined
8988240 i had no contact with her about the latest tour but have heard a description of it sounds way too political for my taste
8988241 i long for the old joyful fun days of the girlie show when the show was entertaining and uplifting and you felt great when you walked out not beaten over the head with a blunt instrument

8988253 nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing

8988271 nowhere in extent at least spread such stretches of heath and moor golden in the spring with the blaze of furze and in the autumn purple with heather and bronzed with the fading fern nowhere in england rise such oak woods their boughs rimed with the frostwork of lichens and dark beech groves with their floor of red brown leaves on which the branches weave their own warp and woof of light and shade
8988272 we are seeing an escalation in the numbers of these apparent gangs
8988273 but we dont know whether this area is any better or worse for teenage gang activity than other areas in new south wales or queensland

8988275 porriott was a womanising conman whose modus operandi was unlike that of jack the ripper

8988277 peoples shopping habits will change and while online retail and corner stores wont replace shopping centres it will eat into their market
8988278 with issues of global warming sustainability and rising petrol prices this will eventually change the way people shop
8988279 people are making fewer trips shorter trips and more basic trips items like bread and milk will be bought at the corner shop over a regional store
8988280 surveys over the past four years suggest people are changing their travel behaviour going to nearby restaurants and switching to public transport for those who can
8988281 instead of travelling long distances people are looking for recreation entertainment and services closer to home
8988282 if you are a gigantic shopping mall you could be concerned but if you are a corner store will see more customers over the next five to 10 years
8988283 we wont see the return of the old fashioned milk bar they will have to be more funky

8988285 i have been here for 16 years and i hope things change its so tough for small business
8988286 these were so old and disgusting they would never be sold as nobody would purchase them
8988287 the old hair systems that were in the seconds boxes were not there to be used on clients because they were so old and heavy
8988288 i know this is the same hair system as it is identical and very rare
8988289 the serial number is not easily removed it would have to be deliberately removed as they dont fall or wash off
8988290 the only reason you would remove the serial number is to avoid identification
8988291 there were at least 20 to 30 old style hair systems in these boxes they were of all varying sizes shapes hair and colours
8988292 this wig was untouched it was in the original state and it had not been cut or styled
8988293 with this type of system the hair is quite long and once it is fitted to the client a hairdresser would then cut and style the hair to the clients needs
8988294 i remember this unit as we were looking for a system for a client to use until his new system came into the store
8988295 the system has been out of date for 12 to 14 years you can no longer buy this system
8988296 he offered the money and i accepted it that was wrong

8988308 b sicamente por la llegada de alumnado inmigrante 11 2 por ciento del total el curso pasado las soluciones dadas por la conselleria han sido el aumento generalizado de las ratios a bulto de la ley y la creaci n de nuevos centros en aulas prefabricadas que atienen mayoritariamente a este alumnado

8988318 it wasnt what i would call an endorsement of russias recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia
8988319 has russian done anything wrong didnt nato send troops into yugoslavia without a mandate from the international community and didnt the united states do the same thing in iraq
8988320 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8988321 depending on what happens in phuket should the airport be open we will continue on to phuket tomorrow morning

8988327 there are men with burns and flesh wounds beginning on the crown of their heads and finishing on the soles of their feet men with limbs off others less fortunate with limbs shattered beyond repair there were men shot through the abdomen men shot through the chest men scarred with ugly bayonet wounds men with burns from bursting shells covering most of their bodies and limbs

8988329 the commanding officer sent over a bottle of champagne and they all drank to my health

8988331 am i satisfied with what the village is doing i dont think so

8988346 six years ago i helped put together the 30th anniversary issue of the student alt weekly paper i edited which gave me the opportunity to familiarize myself with our archives it was a bit startling to see that the coverage of john kerrys ultimately failed 1972 campaign for the u s house of representatives already depicted kerrys ultimate goal as the white house last night kerry gave a mix of the speech liberals wished hed given in 2004 with the speech liberals wished the other convention speakers had given earlier in the week with the denver festivities dominated by the need to humanize michelle obama to introduce a vice presidential nominee whod been announced just over the weekend and to devote two major slots to bill and hillary clinton ritually passing the baton to barack obama the base was thirsting for some red meat
8988347 therell be a crush of cameras at the front door of the white house on jan 20 as scores of media outlets scramble to record the moment when the new president walks in but wait who will be sliding in quietly behind him theyre the ones who will spend the next four years whispering in the presidents ear sitting in strategy sessions running presidential councils filling agency slots and pulling the levers of executive power theyll make up the administration and theyll affect everything from economic policies to war so its worth getting a sense of them in advance of the election
8988348 the present litigation is more complex than the misinformed and mischaracterized allegations of copyright infringement
8988349 the litigation involves the anti competitive nature of the apple eula and similar anti competitive tactics related to the misuse of apples copyrights issues related to the fair use of various intellectual properties by psystar also come into play
8988350 psystar alleges that there is no technical reason that a third party could not accumulate and assemble the hardware components in an apple labeled computer hardware system such that said system would be capable of running the mac os that is such that the system would constitute a mac os capable computer hardware system
8988351 on information and belief psystar alleges that but for the exclusionary conduct of apple and other conduct amounting to unfair competition as set forth in greater detail herein and as exemplified by the activities of psystar a third party could and would assemble the hardware components capable of running the mac os
8988352 that but for the anticompetitive conduct of apple as outlined herein apple labeled computer hardware systems would otherwise be a competing member of the otherwise diverse mac oc capable computer hardware systems market
8988353 any other operating system including but not limited to the windows operating system lacks the potential or ability to deprive apple of its customers especially at a significant level of business as it concerns the mac os
8988354 barack obama is different his unique personal story and promise to change politics explain why he defeated better known candidates to become the democratic presidential nominee yet this convention week is designed to turn obama into something a little less exotic and a little more ordinary as senator robert p casey jr of pennsylvania told delegates on tuesday night obama is one of us too selling obama and his family as your average next door neighbors only smarter better looking and more inspirational is fine that was the underlying theme of michelle obamas convention speech but turning obama into an average politician is a mistake especially if that means attack attack attack
8988355 your will be done on earth as it is in heaven
8988356 again this stands out as robust relative to what is seen in europe and sends a now familiar signal of u s manufacturing competitiveness notably relative to europe
8988357 for the ecb the decline in headline inflation and inflation expectations is good news
8988358 the apparent fall of the euro zone economy into semi stagnation or worse also supports market expectations that the ecb will cut rates eventually

8988376 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8988377 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8988378 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8988379 we dont foresee any sanctions decided on by the european council
8988380 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
8988381 the moldovan government does not consider that the international recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia will bring stability

8988397 in the future we would like to create new applications using this feature
8988398 i have always been driven to the desert i think the landscape itself influences people in a certain way
8988399 we experienced the desert and the sun and the extreme cold in the desert to the nonstop rain in oregon i think the weather and the landscape also influences the character
8988400 this is the exploration of the mystery of a woman called sylvia who has an emotional journey that takes her to the extremes it explores what makes her so damaged
8988401 you should ask people that question why are people so flawed because thats who we are
8988402 why is it when you watch a film and something happens that moves you it either moves you to tears or gives a chill down your spine its because we can see ourselves in that moment
8988403 there is something about kim theres a strength with her leftover vulnerability from her 20s thats just unbelievably beautiful to watch there are moments on the screen when shes shaking her entire body is shaking for real you couldnt act that
8988404 puh lease thats the worst of it calm down crazy pants youre like a nun compared to some of my friends
8988405 if this is the worst thing ive ever done then i think were okay right right
8988406 it means well that i am saving myself until marriage its sort of a symbol of that i guess
8988407 and ironically after several years i now would love to revert back to that sweet demure will do no wrong girl that people saw me as
8988408 but its not and i know its not im either trying to blend in with everyone or to hide insecurities or something to that effect
8988409 having the money to hand means motorists can concentrate on buying at the best price without being enticed into taking out pricey car dealer finance that can see them lumbered with double digit interest rates
8988410 a hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man
8988411 it was a good day during which we looked to fine tune the car for this track as well as trying a few new things
8988412 i would say we have done a good job even if it is too early to say what the situation will be here during the race weekend it was a pleasure to meet with president montezemolo who visited the track today now we have to try and do everything as well as possible to get back to winning again starting with the race in spa the world championship i will give it my best shot and then we can count the points at the end
8988413 in general this three day test has gone well and produced some quite promising results
8988414 there is no greater single indicator of the appeal of a team than a sellout streak and the red sox have been off the charts
8988415 we are able to offer clients great exposure and not only the television exposure they will get
8988416 we have 3 million fans going through the gates each year
8988417 only the size of a boxers heart wins on the canvas
8988418 he taught me to look forward and just learn from the negatives of the past
8988419 it would take too long to describe all the things i have changed
8988420 i have prepared very hard and very long i am in very good shape i want to win
8988421 and we wanted a dispenser that offers consumers greater beverage variety while helping our customers increase beverage profitability
8988422 ich bin f r eine sozial gerechte gesellschaft und deshalb ist es leicht farbe zu bekennen und meine farbe ist rot
8988423 so wie mir das blut in den adern flie t so ist die sozialdemokratie in meinem kopf verankert die intellektuelle st tze die mich durch mein leben begleitet hat ist immer die sozialdemokratie gewesen
8988424 ich wei dass wir in 30 tagen ein riesenfest haben werden
8988425 von werner faymann w nsche ich mir dass er bundeskanzler wird und dass sport wieder zur chefsache wird wie unter seinem vorg nger dass er sich f r die nachwuchsf rderung einsetzt damit wir auch in 20 jahren noch olympiateilnehmer haben
8988426 ich w nsche mir dass die sp die kraft hat diese wahlen zu gewinnen ich traue werner faymann das zu
8988427 die leidenschaft und berzeugung f r und von unserer bewegung
8988428 dass jede stimme eine stimme mehr ist umzusetzen was man sich vorstellt
8988429 dass wir bei werner faymann in den richtigen h nden sind damit diese uns gliche pensionsautomatik nicht kommt
8988430 zutiefst berzeugt dass menschen werner faymann zum bundeskanzler w hlen
8988431 ich bin zutiefst davon berzeugt dass am abend des 28 september die sp feiert und dass die menschen werner faymann zum bundeskanzler w hlen werden
8988432 denn wer so wie die vp nichts macht kann gar nicht populistisch sein die sp dagegen tritt f r die menschen ein und hilft ihnen
8988433 wenn diese rasche hilfe und zuwendung populistisch ist dann sind wir gerne populistisch
8988434 mit dieser vp reicht es uns schon lang wer aber dieses land verbessern will und in eine sichere zukunft mit fairen chancen f r die kinder und guten pensionen f r die lteren f hren will ist uns als partner willkommen
8988435 die sp muss so stark aus der wahlbewegung herausgehen dass gegen uns nicht regiert werden kann
8988436 1 8 milliarden hat finanzminister molterer eingenommen also herr molterer geben sie dieses geld den menschen zur ck und die welt schaut besser aus
8988437 alles was nach 21 jahrhundert riecht schwer suspekt denn die vp will nicht aus dem 19 jahrhundert heraus
8988438 weil sie bundeskanzler alfred gusenbauer und der sp nicht einen funken fortschritt im land g nnen wollte
8988439 verweigern sie sich nicht der zukunftssicht f r unsere kinder und f r jene die auf ffentliche hilfe angewiesen sind
8988440 wir uns f r all das was wir inhaltlich sagen voll einsetzen und wir wollen das auch umsetzen daf r braucht es in einer demokratie freilich eine mehrheit und die werden wir uns suchen
8988441 vp wird aber zu einer partei zur ckkehren m ssen die sich der christlichen soziallehre und der demokratischen tradition verpflichtet f hlt wenn sie das nicht tut wird es eine schwierige diskussion
8988442 die w hlerinnen in der hand die sp so stark zu machen dass unser spitzenkandidat werner faymann bundeskanzler wird dann ist die zukunft gew hrleistet und dann ist es gut
8988443 some people find it helpful to go to the cemetery and grieve and they leave their grief in the cemetery
8988444 there are some people who for whatever reason do not want to have this farewell
8988445 some people find it is a great honour and remembrance
8988446 my family will cherish this diamond for generations and i expect other families will want to do the same
8988447 auf einem so kurzen kurs ist jede zehntel gold wert
8988448 die formel 3 zeigt was uns morgen noch erwarten wird
8988449 hier ist es doppelt schwer die richtige zeit zu fahren denn jeder kleinste fehler kann auf dem rest der runde nicht mehr vollst ndig ausgeglichen werden
8988450 auf dieser strecke hat man keine zeit nachzudenken 82 runden sind extrem anstrengend aber ich bin gut trainiert
8988451 in der senke hat man ein gef hl wie auf der achterbahn man sp rt die volle g kraft
8988452 die kurven hier sind sehr speziell ganz anders als auf anderen kursen unsere arbeit ist hier nicht einfacher als sonst
8988453 ich kann nicht so durch die schnellen kurven fahren wie ich gern w rde
8988454 ich konnte eine schnelle runde fahren und die hat mir ein paar m glichkeiten aufgezeigt
8988455 it is no surprise the american public chose a poodle for obama
8988456 it is so important to pick the right breed for your lifestyle
8988457 wir haben viele interessante dinge gelernt die uns bei unseren vorbereitungen helfen werden
8988458 wir haben viel setups ausprobiert und an der aufh ngung gewerkelt weil das berfahren der kerbs hier sehr wichtig ist ich glaube dass wir auf dem richtigen weg sind
8988459 insgesamt war der dreitagestest jedoch gut und hat vielversprechende ergebnisse gebrach
8988460 unser fokus lag immer auf der zuverl ssigkeit und konstanz und nicht auf der performance demnach lassen die resultate vermuten dass wir in guter verfassung f r die kommenden rennen sind
8988461 ich kann nicht so durch die schnellen kurven fahren wie ich gern w rde
8988462 ich konnte eine schnelle runde fahren und die hat mir ein paar m glichkeiten aufgezeigt
8988463 im like a one eyed cat sleepin in a seafood store
8988464 pretend farmer ive experienced the same general dynamic from both sides of it actually
8988465 well im resentful but i dont feel like i can burden him her
8988466 i know hillary clinton and sarah palin is no hillary clinton

8988476 hes sort of an icon all the customers love him he hangs out the window and everyone has a smile and a laugh
8988477 he is very very pleased to be back home again he was jumping up and down all over me
8988478 while our culinary dexterity as slice bikkie and cake makers may not be as sexy as bronzed mediterranean peasants conjuring a delicious meal out of a rocky hillside it is ours
8988479 the joke about boiling the boot and the pukeko for 10 hours and then eating the boot has been around for years
8988480 t s eliot i think says somewhere that before a country has a culture it has a cuisine
8988481 in a larger sense that might be right but we had got things the wrong way around if our ancestors had brought a cuisine with them then their suitcases of recipes were either washed overboard or lost by british airways at heathrow new zealanders as a nation could not cook
8988482 while our culinary dexterity as slice bikkie and cake makers may not be as sexy as bronzed mediterranean peasants conjuring a delicious meal out of a rocky hillside it is ours
8988483 the full tins that this baking produced also seem to me to nicely bring together frontier hospitality scottish traditions of hospitality and maori manaakitanga hospitality and respect for guests the sharing of food the taking of gifts of food and wine when visiting is another aspect of new zealand food behaviour which has its origins in these parts of our past
8988484 the lange government revolution meant all the rules changed again it got overwhelmed by international styles
8988485 one of the things thats interesting about the idea of a national cuisine is that it seems to be something that people only start talking about and codifying at the point they perceive that its disappearing
8988486 the idea of boiling poultry instead of roasting it is something that we tend not to do and so i did a bit of that using boiler chickens that you can get from chinese supermarkets theyre very hard to find elsewhere any more its interesting when youre used to these industrialised chooks that roast to the texture of marshmallow to get a piece of poultry that can stand bubbling away in the pot for hours and still emerge with some sort of texture
8988487 people telling their fellow citizens what they should be eating
8988488 theres a strong pattern of that in new zealand cooking
8988489 ive interviewed a couple of women whose mothers were staunch followers of ulric williams both of them lived well into their 90s but both of them suffered from goitre because he was very much against iodised salt you really do have to deal with the lack of iodine in new zealand soils
8988490 he seems to have been very influential i remember living in flats in the 1970s where it was thought that anything that contained white flour or white sugar would cause people to drop dead within minutes of eating it
8988491 in the 1930s there was quite a number of flash english cookbooks by chefs that have toheroa soup we were obviously exporting it in tins its one of the few things that was seen as luxurious enough to turn up in those books
8988492 and pavlova has spread across the world lemon delicious pudding turns up in all sorts of spots the first thing thats identifiably a lemon delicious pudding turns up in 1916 in new zealand so we can probably claim it as one of ours
8988493 enviamos uma carta ao governador do estado e j nos reunimos com o deic departamento de investiga es sobre o crime organizado para discutir uma a o
8988494 teve caso de levarem at mala s com roupa suja

8988496 dont say you will follow bin ladin to the gates of hell
8988497 senator mccain has voted 26 times against alternative energy sources more drilling is just a stop gap measure
8988498 obama took the gloves off but never stopped smiling and that is a very dangerous opponent for john mc cain
8988499 solar has been slow to catch because its still the more expensive energy option
8988500 i would say this solar thermal heating is four to five times the cost of a conventional heating system
8988501 with our solar program they can lock in electricity rates for the next 20 years today
8988502 the reason they can do that because once the solar is installed the sunshine is free and maintenance is low
8988503 at first they had me in a bunch of furs
8988504 yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my
8988505 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges
8988506 lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
8988507 turned into a national embarrassment and a symbol of piggish pork barrel spending thanks to mccains relentless criticism of the now abandoned project before becoming governor her political experience consisted of terms as wasillas mayor and councilwoman and a stint as head of the alaska oil and gas conservation commission for her entire political career has been underestimated
8988508 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
8988509 about 40 have signed on to generationext and advertising futures no one we have asked has said no the big win here is advertising week has succeeded in working with the city to build a dedicated high school the high school for innovation advertising amp media which opens next week in canarsie brooklyn and our generationext program is building a state of the art media lab for the school investing a very healthy six figure sum among those participating are deutsch tbwa tribal ddb kirshenbaum bond partners vigilante gardner nelson cliff freeman grey mccann mindshare jwt bbdo uniworld gotham the vidal partnership mpg on and on
8988510 you bet building a public high school in brooklyn dedicated to advertising amp media is as
8988511 in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8988512 avec les qualit s dont disposait d j cette quipe la saison derni re en plus des transferts effectu s elle sera tr s forte il faudra compter avec le club bruges cette saison
8988513 je pense aussi que depuis mon d part jai beaucoup progress sur le plan footballistique jai beaucoup appris la saison derni re en turquie mais en ce d but de saison je dois avouer que je ne suis pas encore au top de ma condition je nai que trois semaines dentra nement dans les jambes et nous devons encore am liorer notre communication en d fense ce match face mes anciennes couleurs tombe donc peut tre un petit peu trop t t pour moi
8988514 estamos discutindo uma quest o atual e o mais estrat gico das organiza es a sua comunica o
8988515 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment but even kate moss doesnt live up to the image
8988516 three years after katrina i wanted to make a statement about the state of the clean up operation
8988517 on coney island in the shadow of the legendary cyclone roller coaster and nathans hot dog stand in an empty storefront on west 12th street
8988518 youre not going to be there so we can just say point blank youre not the nominee
8988519 all i can say is that im not going to be there and i plan on being at the state fair and so you can draw your conclusions from that
8988520 runs great and drives excellently gas saver you will be able to enjoy this vehicle for many miles to come call today to schedule a test drive
8988521 innovation is fostered by information gathered from new connections from insights gained by journeys into other disciplines or places from active collegial networks and fluid open boundaries innovation arises from ongoing circles of exchange where information is not just accumulated or stored but created knowledge is generated anew from connections that werent there before
8988522 approximately 12 million people a year in the u s seek medical care for impacted or excessive cerumen
8988523 developing practical clinical guidelines for physicians to understand the harm vs benefit profile of the intervention was essential
8988524 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and ongoing including infections and hearing loss
8988525 it is hoped that these guidelines will give clinicians the tools they need to spot an issue early and avoid serious outcomes
8988526 where it doesnt matter who your date is or who wears a dress
8988527 if this was in the workplace it would be discrimination and it would be unheard of but because its a school they think they can somehow get away with it
8988528 it fully gives the impression that its wrong to take a same sex partner and i dont think that it is
8988529 if the school ask me to sign a contract im going to say no and just go anyway
8988530 mr peters has been thinking very carefully about this its been very clear to me this was an appropriate course of action but there hasnt had to be a lengthy argument about it
8988531 families are always there every society has a family system
8988532 im an academic and love doing research but there is the chance to advocate here
8988533 it had a very broad mandate and it took a slightly heroic effort from dr prasad to focus it as well as it has
8988534 we cant just transfer research from the united states or england and assume it is right for here so it is hugely important the commission keeps developing its knowledge base
8988535 national is promising a stop to the growing number of bureaucrats who produce an ever increasing mountain of reports documents and strategies that are of questionable use
8988536 what i spot happening is that there are outside agencies coming to the commission for advice for example the police
8988537 im beginning to realise there is a group of people who dont know what we do
8988538 there has been little change to what ordinary families know about what the commission does
8988539 immigrant and refugee families have different cultural values and ideas of the family we need to talk to these groups and find out what issues they have
8988540 how on earth do parents find enough time to spend with children and each other
8988541 we do know quite a lot about the impact of work on families but what about the impact of families on work
8988542 we are in the business for advocating to the government for families that are struggling
8988543 the rate of breakdowns of stepfamilies is as high as with the original families
8988544 when children go into a stepfamily and it breaks down that is when things go pear shaped because there is too much change in their families
8988545 it became so clear to me that what matters to kids is the family group they live in
8988546 bay of plenty have been playing really well and if we dont get up for this game we will come second
8988547 mr peters has been thinking very carefully about this its been very clear to me this was an appropriate course of action but there hasnt had to be a lengthy argument about it
8988548 it is just a piece of paper my mum could sign it
8988549 we did our best to get into the trials we just want to have fun and play
8988550 we worked hard to get into the rep trials gave it our best and then we get this back
8988551 weve pleaded with them to reverse their decision but they told us to take it on the chin
8988552 we are not trying to be nasty but we do have to draw a line in the sand somewhere the paperwork was incomplete
8988553 it wasnt till they were selected for the rep team that the anomaly came through
8988554 but the basic fact is they were not registered by a certain date and for the integrity of the competition they couldnt play
8988555 mr peters is an honourable member and i must accept his word unless i have evidence to the contrary
8988556 i have accepted mr peters word i have to say that i have had dealings with mr peters for a number of years and i consider that i have not ever been led astray by him
8988557 i think its essentially a political issue for the court of public opinion
8988558 i have accepted the honourable members word and will continue to do so unless something arises out of the privileges committee or some other appropriate authority which suggests i shouldnt do so
8988559 mr peters is an honourable member and i must accept his word unless i have evidence to the contrary
8988560 i have accepted mr peters word i have to say that i have had dealings with mr peters for a number of years and i consider that i have not ever been led astray by him
8988561 i think its essentially a political issue for the court of public opinion
8988562 i have accepted the honourable members word and will continue to do so unless something arises out of the privileges committee or some other appropriate authority which suggests i shouldnt do so
8988563 theyre held in large part for the people at home
8988564 and we the media are part of the show so it is a little hard
8988565 we can wrap it up in what we hope is a smart fun different way
8988566 he seems to be getting a lot of response already
8988567 it takes a significant amount of resources not only time but financially
8988568 in denver it wasnt just about change any more but about cash too
8988569 the defining line running through his nomination speech was not wishes but reality
8988570 barack obama is in the process of developing from a redeemer into a politician
8988571 that is a great disappointment for many of his supporters but it is necessary
8988572 i think it has strengthened his position in the campaign whether this now can be balanced by an equally strong performance of mccain waits to be seen
8988573 he was trying to establish his role against a public perception that mccain might be stronger in a crisis situation
8988574 american rhetoric about the american dream in best american style but also a way to give a certain amount of substance to politics and to draw up the border lines to john mccain
8988575 he would be the right future president as long as he does what he promises
8988576 i like his idea to relieve the middle class by reducing taxes
8988577 and a retreat in iraq will be necessary because it is not good for a country to spent too much money on war
8988578 the best of obama as one would say about a music compilation
8988579 in all these months that ive followed him and listened to him i had never seen him so lively in such good form and especially and thats the novelty so aggressive
8988580 is a visionary and would certainly be a sort of fresh breeze on capitol hill
8988581 i think german people would vote in favour of him and hopefully america will do so
8988582 since hillary rodham clinton announced her support he has a true chance of winning the election
8988583 the prejudice in europe that americans are less interested in politics and the parties are not very different
8988584 a phone is only as good as the network its on
8988585 being able to quantify the speed with which populations are able to adapt to these sort of selection pressures is essential for formulating comprehensive policy about climate change
8988586 thats the great thing about stickleback they dont require much prodding to produce a lot of offspring
8988587 these ideas about natural selection and how that affects evolution have been around all the way back to darwin 150 years ago but what he didnt have was any knowledge of genetics
8988588 were only now getting to the stage that we can pinpoint the genes that are responsible for morphological traits that help a species survive and deal with changing environments
8988589 we really need to actually put numbers on these things
8988590 if we exceed those thresholds the species is going to be in trouble and itll go extinct
8988591 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
8988592 had not been briefed and prepared for some of the questions
8988593 im aware of enhanced importance of this issue because of my age
8988594 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself
8988595 gov palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
8988596 who can best help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people who are counting on us
8988597 exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help us fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
8988598 instead of making efforts to try finding solutions in the best interest of the population he wants an election in the best interest of his party
8988599 i was originally enamored with the idea of using a usb drive to hold an entire os so i gave it a go with ubuntu after about a week i started dual booting and within another week i realized that i wasnt using windows at all and made the switch completely
8988600 i got interested in parallel computing and realized that its much easier to build a cluster in linux than in windows
8988601 had to break out of my abusive relationship with microsoft
8988602 i dont get freedom with windows with gnu linux i can compile the kernel especially for my system and select only those apps which are required
8988603 it has 50 fans im not really sure how many
8988604 the head coaches dont run the teams in the national football league
8988605 in the old days if guys got into a fight it was who won
8988606 i guess the world is divided up between redeemers and non redeemers
8988607 i happen to be a redeemer i think people can be made better and right if thats a fault so be it these guys misstepped they made mistakes they paid prices for it that have been verging on ruinous but that doesnt mean i dislike them personally
8988608 theyre going to make decisions that they think are best
8988609 and marvin and the players and all the coaches do the best with what weve got
8988610 le d fi que nous nous sommes pos s est datteindre les objectifs europ ens avant leurope
8988611 le projet est n apr s une s rie de discours de beno t xvi dans lesquels il parlait des ressources de la plan te du d veloppement durable et des solutions technologiques adapt es

8988613 les panneaux recouvriront 2 000 des 5 000m2 que compte le toit et produiront de l nergie lectrique suffisante pour r pondre aux besoins dune centaine de familles
8988614 ont t r alis s sur mesure par rapport aux tuiles originales
8988615 they have a lot of chemicals at the plant and they do take great steps to protect them
8988616 i think everything that can be done to protect those chemicals is being done and i think the public at large is safe
8988617 our back was turned and it was like somebody shined a giant spotlight on us
8988618 i thought my house was falling down on top of me thats how hard the vibration was
8988619 kelly and axl may have met briefly at a party more than four years ago but mr richs fantasy of what happened in reality never did
8988620 ha puesto juntos a republicanos y dem cratas en su administraci n y tiene un historial de haber llevado a cabo el cambio y las reformas que necesitamos en washington
8988621 i think clearly he has attacked others to benefit himself
8988622 it is not fords intention to air the administrations dirty laundry
8988623 mr ford has cooperated with authorities about matters of mutual interest
8988624 it is apparent that the stage of disease incubation in infected donors played a large role in the likelihood of transmission the longer that bse or scrapie had been carried by donors the greater the likelihood of the disease being transmitted with transfusions of infected blood
8988625 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection
8988626 while it may not correlate directly to what happens in the human population due to factors such as species differences in genetic susceptibility to disease it provides greater insight into the role of how vcjd may be carried through infected blood by understanding how vcjd can be transmitted through blood transfusions we can ensure the most effective control measures to minimise human to human infection
8988627 bay of plenty have been playing really well and if we dont get up for this game we will come second
8988628 he is keen to play against samoa but we will know how bad he is next week at the moment hes 50 50 and we wont risk him if he isnt right we wont risk anybody who is questionable
8988629 it will be good for him to get a feel for what is happening outside halfback it will help with his vision and his play being captain and playing at 10 will be a good experience for him
8988630 the test is part of our preparation for the match in brisbane which is now the final of the tri nations its winner takes all
8988631 well see how i pull up tomorrow ive got a couple of physio appointments today and tomorrow and well go from there fingers crossed
8988632 the problem has been that i could run i just couldnt kick the force of the ball on my foot just put all the pressure through my quad and i just wasnt able to kick because its one of those injuries that can easily re occur
8988633 the coaches rob penney and john haggart gave me a break until i was 100 per cent fit and i feel that im a good 95 to 100 per cent now
8988634 we might switch current no 10 sladey colin slade back round to fullback and paul williams to the wing
8988635 we are not the first to make dna tubes with controlled circumferences however compared with previous approaches our method is distinctively simple and modular
8988636 the simplicity of the single stranded tile approach promises to enable us to design ever more complex self assembling molecular systems the work is simultaneously elegant and useful
8988637 predicting how much damage will occur to oil platforms and rigs is a difficult task
8988638 these platforms and rigs may have sustained damage due to past storms and like anything else become more susceptible to threats of wind and storm surge
8988639 if one major deep water production platform is destroyed youre talking about a 1 billion or more loss
8988640 if its multiple rigs and platforms in a variety of water depths then were talking billions of dollars
8988641 and superior in that the offensive smell of infusions was eliminated
8988642 as they capture mosquitoes that have had a blood meal and thus more opportunity to become infected
8988643 each female mosquito has the potential to produce about 200 eggs and she can have as many as five cycles so when we capture a gravid mosquito that can remove as many as 500 females
8988644 sampling the species in urban environments has been a challenge until studies on its oviposition cues allowed the development of gravid female traps that collect mostly females that previously have blood fed and therefore had a chance to become infected
8988645 to not only us but third world countries where culex quinquefasciatus is a problem
8988646 an uncertain revolution why the rise of a genetic model of mental illness has not increased tolerance
8988647 in the case of schizophrenia genetic arguments are associated with fears regarding violence
8988648 in fact attributing schizophrenia to genes is no different from attributing it to bad character either way americans see those with schizophrenia as damaged in some essential way and therefore likely to be violent however when applied to depression genetic arguments have very different connotations they are associated with social acceptance if you imagine that someones depression is a genetic problem the condition seems more real and less blameworthy its in their genes theyre not weak so i should accept them for who they are
8988649 while the stigma surrounding mental illness has not diminished the rate of treatment for psychiatric disorders has increased
8988650 the culture surrounding mental illness has become more treatment focused with direct to consumer advertising of psychiatric medications now a mainstay of popular media
8988651 has been flying dawn out from baltimore to him for private meetings and these meetings are preparing her to be the breakout star in a solo career apparently diddy believes shes the most talented of the group and the girls are pissy because they disagree
8988652 at no point was dawn flown anywhere to record solo or meet alone with diddy the girls are still very much together theyre going out to the mtv video music awards together and theyre promoting their album welcome to the dollhouse and working on their third
8988653 if the rapist was a migrant we fear he may well have already gone possibly to england or to another french port its also possible hes gone to belgium or the netherlands
8988654 the young workman who saw it was astounded and shouted land mine
8988655 as far as i see it yeah i would love to go back out and ive already mentioned it to my commanding officer that i want to go out very very soon
8988656 second theyre aiming to reinforce message of reform palin is someone who has made a mark on both the state of alaska and nationally as someone who has taken on ethics reform boldly the mccain campaign seems to believe those two qualities will more than make up for her lack of national exposure
8988657 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
8988658 we always worry a little bit but we think our arguments are pretty strong

8988667 there is sound scientific evidence that using a cellphone while driving can be extremely dangerous
8988668 it greatly increases your chance of a serious road crash resulting in a hospital stay the consequences of serious collisions can last a lifetime as physicians we see truly tragic evidence of this every day in our practices
8988669 this is an important first step toward what we hope will be a full ban in the future
8988670 look i picked someone with a vagina vote for me but disregard the fact that shes unlike hillary in every way
8988671 el shakhtar es un conjunto que trabaja mucho y est muy unido van todos a una tanto en ataque como en defensa y por ello tendremos que afrontar el partido con mucha seriedad
8988672 la afici n del shakhtar es bastante dura e incluso hab amos vivido algunos problemas al acabar el encuentro
8988673 a la afici n ucraniana le gustan mucho los grandes equipos y los buenos jugadores
8988674 nosotros debemos hacer la nuestra y salir a ganar el partido y no fallar
8988675 when you really believe in something you have to make a bold statement
8988676 losing my hair this way is nothing like what people with cancer go through and for women it is awful losing their hair
8988677 i was hoping more people would come and support my cause
8988678 i just want to raise awareness my brothers cancer started off as melanoma and has rapidly progressed i want to let people know that there are worse things in life than losing your hair
8988679 i am aware that there is a higher risk for me to get a form of cancer because its in my family i already have my share of health problems like epilepsy diabetes and hyper thyroidism
8988680 i cant believe im still around with all my health problems and i have watched so many people around me die all i know is death is apart of life and somehow all of this has made me a stronger person
8988681 there has been a lot of interest in the festival and we are expecting a few hundred people through the library on sunday
8988682 it shows children that they too can become award winning writers
8988683 the authors will talk a bit about their history their books and about their love of writing its quite inspiring
8988684 they all bring something different with their writing style and subject its not just for young children there are books for teenagers and for adults who may have enjoyed some of the authors work in the past
8988685 with tasman not being there next year pretty much every week its important for us to win because its another opportunity to say stuff you guys you got rid of us
8988686 in three years weve gone from a team that didnt win any games to a team that can foot it with the big unions so every week is an opportunity for us to say that again
8988687 obviously ive played quite a few first class games now what with this being my third year of super 14 and npc so i think ill find it easier to find a new union than some other guys will
8988688 at this stage my contract with tasman is for next year as well and still has to be honoured as far as the monetary part is concerned but obviously ive got to look for a new union come next years npc
8988689 playing against each other is something me and owen have joked about since we were kids and i suppose the day has come
8988690 but the way ive always seen rugby is that family doesnt come into it and once were into the game he wont be my brother that doesnt count on the field that just comes in after the game
8988691 its been great for the last few years with owen because hes really pushed me and hes probably my no 1 training partner i dont want to lose to him at anything not even doing weights and i know he feels the same
8988692 weve got a really great record at ellis park 29 wins in 41 tests and it always feels great to play a test at this venue
8988693 no test match is a dead rubber even though there will be no trophies to be won on saturday we have to show we are on the right track
8988694 theres still the end of year tour to come and we dont want to go on that trip thinking about whether we should change things or worry if things are working or not
8988695 we want to get some confidence out of this game
8988696 it was a temptation to make changes but i studied the game and i felt we werent too bad
8988697 if we lose three in a row how can you change that winning and losing are the same thing to me its just that winning is much nicer
8988698 maybe our fire wasnt hot enough last week maybe we didnt have the right pots and pans hopefully we can eat the food this weekend
8988699 the meeting was held in a good spirit and we spoke openly about the issues
8988700 we will probably have half our team signed by monday tuesday next week
8988701 give away too much to some of the other franchises
8988702 and shes one of the long term prospects to stay with us a local girl thats what you want as a franchise you want to be able to bring through players from your own region
8988703 theres not exactly an over supply of players in the new zealand market its good if you can home grow them
8988704 we believe netball nz should do the same as australia which is basically two imports and sure they can put some reasonably tight restrictions around the second one
8988705 will be overly competitive unless you allow them the potential of two
8988706 the whole things really accelerated in new zealand theres a lot of contact from agents
8988707 it can vary from a few hours to a few days
8988708 i think it is really slack as a customer we cant go anywhere else because they own the lines
8988709 we just want to know what is going on but no one will talk to us
8988710 we would love to have broadband weve got children who need the internet we want the telephone but we cant get it because it is something thats not available to us
8988711 getting our customer service right is something we take very seriously

8988718 it might be unfair calling jessica simpsons show at the avalon ballroom wednesday a train wreck at some point a train knows where its going jessica is still living in a reality show convinced everyone is so fascinated with her personal life theyd rather hear her talk than sing
8988719 the only thing simpson has in common with dolly parton are huge hair extensions
8988720 it is just a piece of paper my mum could sign it
8988721 we did our best to get into the trials we just want to have fun and play
8988722 we worked hard to get into the rep trials gave it our best and then we get this back
8988723 weve pleaded with them to reverse their decision but they told us to take it on the chin
8988724 we are not trying to be nasty but we do have to draw a line in the sand somewhere the paperwork was incomplete
8988725 it wasnt till they were selected for the rep team that the anomaly came through
8988726 but the basic fact is they were not registered by a certain date and for the integrity of the competition they couldnt play
8988727 ive been in hot temperatures before and i like it but with my injury i dont sweat and have to spray water to cool myself down
8988728 some of the other guys are more affected by the heat than i am
8988729 the rest of my training building up to beijing is pretty hard six days a week
8988730 its such a strong competition that it usually goes goal for goal between any of the top four or five teams its high pressure rugby
8988731 obviously in the franks ben and owen case it is brother against brother but really if you focus on individuals and you focus on those sorts of contests you can be distracted
8988732 the jersey of the opposition is irrelevant really its much more important that we focus on our performance
8988733 im coaching canterbury and im just worrying about what this team does
8988734 no matter who the opposition is if our performances are up to scratch thats all i can ever ask for
8988735 assistant coach john haggart and i are really emphasising the need to do what we do and perform at the best of our ability and if its not good enough on the day so be it but lets not die wondering
8988736 weve got a lot of young people in this group and were exploring every avenue we can to increase their confidence and assuredness and decision making
8988737 this is the second time hes been with us and hes spent two days each time and done one on one with the boys hes done work with hags and i and hes doing one group session each time hes here
8988738 its very much a when the pupil is ready the teacher appears philosophy
8988739 i hear were playing for it but i havent seen it yet
8988740 i think whoever had it last doesnt want to hand it over weve got it by name anyway weve just havent got it in the flesh
8988741 bit of a misunderstanding and weve now sorted it out
8988742 its still in hawkes bay but its on its way down here im not exactly sure when its arriving
8988743 theyve got some big boys and theyve got some slick backs so id imagine well definitely have our work cut out and if we take them lightly we could come unstuck so were prepared to play them as if theyre auckland
8988744 if you looked at the whole season youd be thinking if we could get a point out of adelaide away that would be decent
8988745 i think weve got a side that is capable of winning away or winning at home if we can get 30 points and they all come away while thats disappointing to yourselves and the public its points that are needed
8988746 id probably pencilled in four points weve got one so we are three points behind the target at the moment but weve got to move forward
8988747 it gets no easier this week adelaide are a good side but a good challenge for us and one i think that were capable of getting something from
8988748 we wont hold back well certainly be going in with a positive frame of mind
8988749 im a kiwi boy theres nothing better than going across the tasman and spanking somebody so why not this weekend
8988750 i dont anticipate what the outcome will be but im fearful that we wont get the response we want
8988751 the timeframe is definitely december 31 if we dont have our public liability in place by then there wont be any racing from january 1
8988752 australian jockeys are taking this issue very seriously it would be a shame to see it disrupt something like the spring carnival
8988753 each one of us face these difficult issues every time we step on to a horse
8988754 we want the racing industry to get behind us all we are asking for is one per cent of prizemoney
8988755 ive been fortunate to get back into the saddle but many havent been so lucky
8988756 if jockeys are not provided basic protections more of them will leave the sport putting the ongoing viability of the industry at risk
8988757 behind the glamour of the racing industry there is a side the general public dont see
8988758 our jockeys put their lives on the line each time they race
8988759 i was a bit disappointed about how much jamal leaving the field affected us
8988760 ive got to take that on the chin i didnt really have a backup plan but you can only pick the blokes that are available
8988761 the good news is tamaivas jaw isnt broken and hell be playing this week he ended up with nine stitches but hes a tough little bugger
8988762 i dont know what bay of plenty put out there i dont know what auckland put out there i didnt recognise any of the names
8988763 maybe we took it a bit casually so weve put them on notice we know were in a competition now and we need to step it up
8988764 hopefully it has woken a few up that have never had the opportunity to play at this level before

8988767 not every dish at perbacco succeeds but something is indeed happening here and apparently has been for four months since the restaurant welcomed simone bonelli a 26 year old chef brimming with ideas and ambition its experimental lupa meets wd 50 across much of the menu mr bonelli plays games
8988768 matsugen isnt really jean georges restaurant the kitchen is run by the matsushita brothers three noodle maestros who also operate restaurants in tokyo and honolulu their specialty is the japanese buckwheat noodle called soba which they make fresh here every day but soba is a casual dish and to provide the necessary big restaurant heft and cash flow the matsushitas have added a hodgepodge of options including workmanlike tempura pricey uninspired sushi even a ridiculously effete version of shabu shabu
8988769 there is a breed of trendy restaurant where one gets the sense that the chef thinks he or she was the first to discover meat the group of momofuku establishments which serve dozens of pork exalting dishes to a young clientele that seems unendingly starry eyed about them is a prime example i see kafana as a response to this breed of restaurant is kafana newly opened check in a hip neighborhood check glorifying meat deliciously but theres nothing sassy about the little rustic bistro no assumption that carnivory is a misunderstood art or one ripe for reinvention
8988770 in general the paella is better than the tapas and its also as paella tends to be colorful and appealing
8988771 theyve indicated that if we dont all use this vaccine cautiously we could run out sometime in september
8988772 consequently the michigan department of community health has requested that health providers contact them first and obtain an confirmation code prior to ordering any vaccines
8988773 probably one of the best ways that rabies has been prevented is the fact that rabies vaccines have been used in dogs and cats for a number of years
8988774 the demand for a new generation of connectors is very high
8988775 as the many benefits of microfluidic technology are becoming more widely understood and as microfluidic chips are becoming more complex being able to get the fluids into and out of such small scale devices is becoming the major design issue at dolomite we are working with many companies around the world on a number of projects and we are finding that connector design and production is now an important part of what we do alongside the actual chip design and manufacture
8988776 the connections are very close together roughly 3mm apart this makes it a very compact solution there is not another connector on the market like this similar connectors are bigger and use other less versatile techniques such as sealing the tubes to the chip with adhesive the connector is a big achievement for our design team and we are confident that it will be widely adopted by the microfluidics community
8988777 an alaska state trooper involved in a rough divorce from palins sister
8988778 obviously with there only being four home test matches it was going to be a difficult ask for new zealand cricket to allocate two tests to the basin
8988779 in my mind we are a two test a summer venue so theres always a tinge of disappointment when weve only got the one but thats going to be a great fixture
8988780 the icing on the cake is the twenty20 we know how our city gets in behind the sevens so id like to think we can create the same sort of mood
8988781 theres no escaping twenty20 the market is really embracing it now
8988782 i really liked doing the vault because you get to jump off
8988783 its a pretty good sport you have to be really flexible

8988788 i just hit the starter button and it didnt work
8988789 we tried everything in the end we rolled the car back pushed it and finally got it going it had nothing to do with tactics
8988790 so tomorrow it looks like ill be first car on the road ok it wont be easy but weve found a good rhythm today so well see what we can do
8988791 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same

8988799 were probably halfway through our touring cycle now weve got shit lined up at the end of this year with slipknot and then weve just landed something real super cool at the beginning of next year we got summer festivals next year and we want to do a proper headlining in america and overseas because we havent done that weve just done co headlining were halfway through man we tour to the end of next year 2010 to write a new album out for 2011
8988800 more recently she has come under the scrutiny of an investigation by the republican controlled legislature into the possibility that she ordered the dismissal of alaskas public safety commissioner because he would not fire her former brother in law as a state trooper
8988801 monegan than alleged that he had been pressured to fire state trooper mike wooten who was married to palins sister and was involved in a contentious divorce according to the anchorage daily news
8988802 palin has denied any wrongdoing the state legislature voted on july 28 to hire an independent investigator to probe whether palin her family or members of her administration had pressured monegan to fire wooten according to the daily news
8988803 palin hasnt been implicated in the four year old federal corruption investigation which has resulted in convictions of or guilty pleas from three state legislators murkowskis former chief of staff and two executives of an oil services company as well as the indictment of senator ted stevens

8988840 i do not know why he was there but it is a fact that he was in the building among georgian special forces troops
8988841 we have serious reasons to believe that american citizens were right at the heart of the military action
8988842 if i give you my cake and wine i shall have none left for myself you just go your own way
8988843 they have a lot of chemicals at the plant and they do take great steps to protect them
8988844 i think everything that can be done to protect those chemicals is being done and i think the public at large is safe
8988845 our thoughts and prayers are with the families of these employees during this very difficult time
8988846 this is a very sad day for the institute site family
8988847 our back was turned and it was like somebody shined a giant spotlight on us
8988848 i thought my house was falling down on top of me thats how hard the vibration was
8988849 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
8988850 what were dealing with here is a use of the technology that i dont think the good people at magellan or garmin or tomtom really thought about when they were developing it
8988851 typically the gps data being used is for the purpose of contradicting defendants alibis
8988852 the biggest political gamble i think just about in american political history
8988853 a blue collar conservative woman who will excite the republican party and lay out the welcome mat for independents and disaffected clinton voters
8988854 and a running mate is not going to matter with women voters
8988855 shows that theyre making a concerted effort to go after women voters who are upset that barack obama passed over hillary clinton
8988856 we are living at a moment in which the massive outward migration of the affluent that characterized the second half of the 20th century is coming to an end
8988857 is the signal that an america that seemed distined for everlasting individualization and sprawl is experimenting with new versions of community and sociability
8988858 the main goal i have for myself and the staff is to develop an awareness of everything in our maintenance program that affects the environment and the energy that is used in our day to day operation we strive to make our course as environmentally friendly as possible when at all possible we try to foster cooperation rather than competition with our environment
8988859 our national spirit must exude joy and pleasure and say you have done well daughter of zimbabwe we are proud of you we wish you well shes our golden girl take care of her
8988860 information that divulges plaintiffs fraud detection plan and materials protected by attorney client and work product privilege
8988861 as you know we thought deeply about the expropriation bill and we after serious considerations felt that it would not be the correct instrument to speed up the acquisition of land
8988862 from different submissions it became clear to us that market values and the encouragement of cooperation and help and advice from the state would be a better way of promoting the acquisition of land
8988863 the above however does not take away the responsibility from us to see to it that more people are advantaged through economic participation
8988864 our country will only be peaceful when a larger number of people own property and assets which they want to protect
8988865 if we could get the balance right of availability of land availability of resources from the state expertise training and partnerships between white farmers and black farmers we could in my opinion succeed
8988866 the department does not know of any stakeholders who require consultation
8988867 public participation in this process was very successful with all venues with the exception of mthatha full to capacity in these hearings the bill was debated comprehensively questions were raised clarification was sought and provided
8988868 i didnt have time to write a short letter so i created a video sign in before you can post messages
8988869 i didnt have time to write a short letter so i created a video
8988870 this agreement now ends in november of 2011 rather than november of 2008 so we have stability in income
8988871 weve spent a lot of time and energy making sure that google understands that it cannot turn us into an arm of google
8988872 if the protection of our independence would come into conflict with google or any of our search partners we would opt for the community who built firefox and love firefox
8988873 the use of games or gaming dynamics not simply to entertain the player but rather to inspire a particular action effect some type of attitudinal behavioral change or instill a particular lesson in the service of an organizational goal
8988874 this is really a story of hitting this younger generation of workers where it lives as well as speaking to some of the issues like the desire of workers to bring personal technology to the workplace and the need to be more environmentally and cost conscious in it decisions
8988875 for those deploying games deciding whether their target audience internalized the lesson instead of just becoming good at playing the game is paramount
8988876 proving the efficacy of a game for a particular business depends on the goal of the game for something as straightforward as training it is important to tie the goals of the game to a particular outcome
8988877 im going to guess that davidson will be the favorite in our league and that stephen curry will be the consensus preseason player of the year
8988878 what they did last year brought a lot of national attention and notoriety to our league
8988879 and they have been so good i was talking to charleston head coach bobby cremins and he said when i signed up for this two years ago nobody warned me about curry
8988880 so the rest of us coaches in the league can either whine and cry about it or work hard to pull ourselves to that level
8988881 we won our division but we didnt take care of our business in the tournament
8988882 weve got all the motivation we need to go out there and earn another shot
8988883 were the only team in the league thats beat them in the last two years
8988884 it was so exciting to see what they did last year i was cheering for them and i know how close we are to their level im just disappointed that we only get to play them once this year
8988885 our 20 0 was not an easy task last season
8988886 there were plenty of games that we could have lost if not for an opportune situation here or there you look at what this league did out of conference last year charleston beat temple appalachian beat arkansas wofford beat purdue on their home court there were plenty of indications that teams in the southern conference can play with anybody in the country
8988887 the most important thing for us is that he gets better he has a mindset that he wants to become a more well rounded player and hes worked at it very very hard
8988888 our coaches wanted to go back down to 16 that was a unanimous vote in our league
8988889 but it was shot down by the people above us the athletic directors were split on it but the presidents were pretty adamant about keeping things the way they are it gives them those 10 guaranteed home games

8988952 as far as the perception of these events by the general public goes it depends not only on politicians but also on how artful they are in controlling the mass media and our american colleagues do this much better than we do and theres a lot we can learn from them

8988954 on 7 august at 14 42 the georgian peacekeepers left the headquarters of the peacekeeping forces under the pretext that theyd received orders from their commanders to leave their posts and they never returned one hour later heavy artillery shelling began at 22 35 a massive bombardment of tsklhinval started at 22 50 the transfer of georgian ground troops started to the combat area at the same time georgian field hospitals were set up and at 23 30 the brigadeer general commanding the georgian peacekeeping forces announced that georgia has declared a war against south ossetia they announced this publicly looking straight into the tv cameras at that point we tried to contact the georgian leadership but everyone refused to talk to us at 12 45 am on the 8th of august the georgian commander repeated his statement so who attacked whom

8988983 i have accepted mr peters word i have to say that i have had dealings with mr peters for a number of years and i consider that i have not ever been led astray by him

8989229 on a basic level all of the mentioned methods in my prior post seasoning your yixing do the same rinse teapot to remove dust fill with tea and let sit for a while or submerge the whole pot in tea rinse and let dry the main difference is in time and whether to submerge the whole teapot or only season the inside ive seasoned quite a few yixing pots over the years and believe the pot should definitely be submerged in tea for a longish 1 hour to overnight time when people speak about seasoning and patina not only the inside but also the outside of the teapot is important id also recommend to use an old toothbrush to clean out dust particles from the inside my steps usually are place new yixing pot into a pot of cold water take lid off the pot and place in pot separately bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes remove yixing pot and lid from pot rinse with warm water and scrub with toothbrush place teapot plus lid in a pot of fresh cold water and bring to a boil remove yixing pot from water add a decent amount of tea leaves into pot and put back in hot water some of them will float out most will stay in pot simmer for about 1 hour let yixing sit in pot over night remove all tea leaves you might need to rinse with the tea from the big pot and let the open yixing dry out of direct sunlight note that i dont rinse the pot with water at the end most of the patina comes from frequent use theres different approaches to creating an even patina but i usually dont use just water on my teapots except to preheat before brewing tea after a gong fu session i brew an extra infusion that i use to clean the teapot with i pour this infusion off into a faircup then remove all leaves i can and rinse the inside of the yixing with some of the infusion to remove the rest of the leaves if i want to build up a patina quickly i rinse the outside of the teapot with the rest of the infusion rubbing it in my hands to spread the tea over the whole surface of the teapot this way you can create a nice patina in about 2 month time for teapots you use 3 4 times a week keep in mind theres no science to this as long as you clean your teapot and give it an initial seasoning with tea whichever way you chose to use you should be on your way

8989438 dan tiadalah kami mengutus kamu melainkan untuk menjadi rahmat bagi alam semesta
8989439 sudah amat jelaslah dengan semua perbandingan ini kita dapat melihat betapa bedanya nabi muhammad daripada nabi musa ini sesungguhnya membuktikan umat islam yang cuba mencari kemiripan antara musa dan muhammad hanya melakukannya kerana mereka sudah terdesak untuk mengesahkan kerasulan nabi muhammad konon melalui rujukan rujukan dari kitab taurat jadi di manakah pengesahan dan kemiripan itu langsung tidak ada sama sekali demi allah yang jiwaku ada ditangannya kami umat islam tidak pernah mencari pengesahan dr orang kafir tentang kerasulan muhammad cukuplah allah yang jadi saksi atas kerasulannya dan orang yang beserta mummad yaitu sahabatnya apakah kami terdesak jelas tidak bagi kami anda percaya atau tidak allah tetap berkuasa menjadikan rasul siapa yang dia kehendaki lagipula dalil diatas juga bisa dijadikan argumen bahwa muhammad ada kemiripan yang pasti tdk semunya jika anda tuntut semuanya jelas anda tidak mengerti hakikat kehidupan manusia nah sebetulnya kata kuncinya ada pada klaim anda bahwa yesus lah yang dimaksud nabi yang mirip musa dia berkata
8989440 setelah rasul datang kepada mereka mereka berkata mengapa tidak diberikan kepada muhammad seumpama yang diberikan kepada nabi musa yakni tanda tanda mukjizat katakanlah ya muhammad maka kamu tunjukkanlah sebuah kitab dari allah
8989441 seorang nabi dari tengah tengahmu dari antara saudara saudara kamu sama seperti aku yakni nabi musa akan dibangkitkan bagimu oleh tuhan allahmu dialah yang harus kamu dengarkan seorang nabi akan ku bangkitkan bagi mereka dari antara saudara mereka seperti engkau nabi musa ini aku akan menaruh firman ku dalam mulutnya dan dia akan mengatakan kepada mereka segala yang ku perintahkan kepadanya

8989443 ada tertulis demikian al masih harus menderita dan bangkit dari antara orang mati pada hari yang ketiga dan lagi dalam nama nya berita tentang pertaubatan dan pengampunan dosa harus disampaikan kepada segala bangsa mulai dari yerusalam kamu adalah saksi saksi dari semuanya ini
8989444 firman ku yang akan diucapkan nabi itu demi nama ku
8989445 aku berlindung kepada allah dari godaan syaitan yang terkutuk dengan nama allah yang maha pengasih lagi maha penyayang

8989448 kepadamu dan kepada keturunanmu akan kuberikan negeri ini yang kau diami sebagai orang asing yakni seluruh tanah kanaan akan kuberikan menjadi milikmu untuk selama lamanya dan aku akan menjadi allah mereka
8989449 janganlah kamu menyangka bahwa aku datang untuk meniadakan hukum taurat atau kitab para nabi aku datang bukan untuk meniadakannya melainkan untuk menggenapinya

8989454 telecinco emiti la noche del martes un d ptico destinado a recordar los a os del destape en el cine y las revistas lo emiti de madrugada y de tapadillo empez una hora m s tarde de lo que anunciaba la parrilla de la cadena como si a estas alturas se avergonzasen del destape el programa no llevaba firma pero era f cil reconocer tras el al mismo equipo que hace hormigas blancas la misma documentaci n parcial y llena de lagunas la misma selecci n de la prensa de la poca en favor de unas publicaciones y en detrimento de otras que en su momento eran mucho m s representativas pese a todo fue un programa interesante
8989455 el destape que promete segunda entrega avanza a o por a o desde que en 1967 se adivin el primer pez n en las pantallas espa olas hasta que ya en los ochenta el cine patrio dio un giro y aunque segu a ense ndonos tetas como lo hace hoy en d a dej de interesar a la gente susana estrada mirta miller y silvia tortosa entre otras aportan sus recuerdos y sus cuerpos de entonces a esta serie documental que hace un dibujo ya conocido de los ltimos a os del franquismo y de la transici n y sobre todo recupera mil y una im genes de desnudos sacadas tanto del celuloide como del papel impreso
8989456 el doblaje altera las pel culas y las series ver a chus lampreave doblada produce una mezcla de risa y pena lo que se pierde esta gente no escuchando a la gran chus pensamos pues bien a nosotros nos ocurre igual no s si es l gico posible o recomendable doblar the wire en la que los acentos y la forma de hablar de los personajes son elementos fundamentales imagino que en cierto modo es necesario si queremos que tengan una m nima audiencia en espa a aunque tambi n podr a ser que esa audiencia m nima que de todos modos tendr n de ning n modo van a ser seguidas masivamente eso lo tengo clar simo aqu queremos a das y alc ntaras preferir a verlas con subt tulos
8989457 el programa que afortunadamente ya llega a su fin ha pasado en medio de la indiferencia m s absoluta
8989458 al gran profesional que es sobera le identificaremos siempre con aquel magn fico quiere ser millonario de t 5 de 1999 a 2001 como le pasa ahora tampoco logr atraer a m s telespectadores cuando le contrat antena 3 tv 2004 para hacer un sinf n de concursos de medio pelo y flacos resultados hasta que esta cadena recuper su programa talism n rebautizado qui n quiere ser millonario 2005 hace tiempo que sobera no arquea las cejas
8989459 es otra de esas series de todo a cien con las que cuatro rellena su parrilla cuando no sabe qu hacer sigue por la ma ana en el lugar de concha garc a campoy todos hemos perdido con el cambio
8989460 una de las causas de su p rdida de fuerza es que cuando la pel cula se exhibe en abierto ya la ha visto todo el mundo primero se estrena en las salas luego el dvd luego se en el cable y todo ello sin contar con que el ni o que es un pirata se la baje de internet total que cuando llega batman a la cadena generalista todo el mundo dice qu pereza y encima los derechos de emisi n valen un dineral el abanico de los canales tem ticos sin embargo ofrece posibilidades distintas as podemos entender el cine en tv como una ocasi n para revisar cl sicos

8989470 while shopping for a large screen television i had considered the toshiba tn 43v71 and this model the sony kp 43t75
8989471 crt advantages wider viewing angle both vertical 55 degrees and horizontal 130 degrees and shorter minimum viewing distance only 5 feet
8989472 although the kp 43t75 projection tv has a larger screen it is lighter and can be moved more easily it also is a good choice for apartments or other smaller living spaces
8989473 kp 43t75 connection component video in 1 s video inputs rear front 2 1 composite inputs rear front 2 1 rf outputs 2 monitor output 1

8989569 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8989570 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8989571 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8989572 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
8989573 if they remain independent they will always be subject to the attacks of georgian imperialism
8989574 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
8989575 sarah palin is an exciting choice by senator mccain she completes a strong ticket that will bring a real record of change and reform to washington
8989576 she is a strong defender of traditional family values with an unquestioned commitment to protect life governor palin knows we must aggressively pursue american energy sources like offshore drilling to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
8989577 in choosing governor palin mccain has put washington on notice he is serious about shaking up the status quo and leading a movement for reform on behalf of families and small businesses
8989578 the choice of sarah palin is surely a hail mary pass
8989579 it is a real roll of the dice and shows what a strong position the obama biden team and democrats in general are in in this election
8989580 while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
8989581 given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgment it shows political panic
8989582 whats going to happen here is that desire to change that hillary clinton has helped bring about will ultimately lead to an obama biden win in november i dont think it changes the dynamics
8989583 i think as they come to know gov sarah palin they are going to see her not simply as an embodiment of those strong conservative values that thrill my heart but they are going to see her as an embodiment of an accomplished american women
8989584 and i believe that will resonate with millions of american women
8989585 i believe that people will look back and assess how hillary was treated by the media during the campaign primaries and it remains to be seen whether or not the ugly head of sexism in the media will raise its head again

8989608 we are also giving last years winner ian porlayagan a chance to join the pageant again because we believe that everybody deserves another chance since he expressed his desire to compete and represent the country
8989609 this pageant is like a fashion pageant it will be fast paced there will be no special awards after the swim wear and formal wear competitions we will cut the finalist in half then we will proceed to the q and a then the announcement of the winner will follow the first and second runners up will get p5 000 and p10 000 respectively and the winner will receive p20 000
