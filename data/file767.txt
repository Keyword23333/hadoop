7670000 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7670001 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7670002 these repeated violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7670003 however we will play a constructive role in light of the charter of democracy and continue our struggle for the restoration of judges and genuine democracy in pakistan

7670011 i know a man his name is batman steamroller got him now hes flatman
7670012 a pessimist is one who makes difficulties of his opportunities an optimist is one who makes opportunities of his difficulties
7670013 we are all just human beings who want to feel good about what we do

7670018 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7670019 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7670020 the united states will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7670021 recognition would also be inconsistent with unanimously approved united nations security resolutions that russia has consistently voted for in the past
7670022 will be delivering the word of americas support and also consulting on how these leaders in the region see the future playing out
7670023 theres been costs in terms of their reputation theres costs in terms of the ability and willingness to do business in russia for example
7670024 youre probably thinking a normal teenager doesnt do this well ask dick
7670025 at the end of the day there was no way i was not going to put this girl first before whatever damage might be done to me
7670026 before he leaves the house i have to make sure hes halfway decent
7670027 half the time its like why are you wearing a red polo with purple shorts matthews not at all concerned with color coordination and he puts together some funky outfits
7670028 this exertion of style preferences is part of the individuation process but at age 3 and 4 they dont understand social structure and societal rules especially when it comes to matters of appearance
7670029 so youre going to get clashing mismatched outfits that really miss the mark but its our job to use these moments as teaching opportunities and provide structure and boundaries for them to work within
7670030 its important to allow for the development of likes and dislikes and to permit that to translate into the selection of clothing but its also your duty to instill the values of self respect and integrity
7670031 its easy to assume veto power and be very authoritarian but you should leave them some choice in the matter
7670032 you can divide things into designated drawers one for home or play wear one for school one for dressy occasions or fancy holidays and so on
7670033 this will give them more leeway and the descriptive labels will help guide their judgment calls its also going to help them start to understand the method behind the madness or the why behind how adults pick clothes
7670034 thats not to say youll always appeal to their logic and circumvent a tantrum
7670035 but itll sink in eventually when you give the explanation of why its not acceptable to wear a ratty dirty t shirt to kindergarten
7670036 i tell matthew ok ill let you wear that shirt but youve got to change the shorts if its really hideous
7670037 and ive been able to convince him to put something on over his superhero shirts which hes obsessed with theres usually a lot of camouflaging going on
7670038 im not worried about those figures appearing on his clothes because i see it as a form of imaginative play
7670039 theres this transformation that takes place when he puts on one of those shirts i think matthew has this perception that some of their powers will transfer over to him and he even does those little spider web shooting poses when he wears one
7670040 as a parent you just have to let it go
7670041 a skirt with tights wouldnt be much fun to play in on the monkey bars would it
7670042 you dont want to get your pretty velvet christmas dress stained during art class do you
7670043 as a gay man i yearn for a president who respects the rights of all americans
7670044 stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau
7670045 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
7670046 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint

7670048 harry williams is currently in the post surgical recovery phase at presbyterian hospital dallas and will remain under observation dr drew dossett performed surgery on sunday august 24 2008 to fuse and stabilize the cervical spine levels c 2 through c 4 given the severity and depth of the injury to his neck and spine it is highly unlikely that harry will return to football we will continue to provide updates on harrys condition as they become available

7670051 we believe we will emerge from this economic cycle in an even stronger competitive position
7670052 the number of super delegates has gotten too large in relation to overall delegates
7670053 we want to give more control back to the voters everyone thinks there ought to be more weight given to the results of the elections
7670054 we agree that we ought to make sure theyre funded properly staffed properly and run smoothly and even see if people ought to be eligible to vote absentee
7670055 global trading conditions for wine continue to be competitive but the category remains in solid growth
7670056 we have not been immune from industry wide pressures including an economic slowdown in key markets and higher grape prices
7670057 foreign exchange movements in the 12 months to 30 june 2008 cut wine earnings by approximately 70 million and wine growth by 14 6 percentage points
7670058 put simply financial returns from wine have not met our expectations
7670059 we are making good progress with our wine review but wont be commenting on our analysis or conclusions until the review is completed
7670060 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognise these separatist regions
7670061 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7670062 the united states will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7670063 recognition would also be inconsistent with unanimously approved united nations security council resolutions that russia has consistently voted for in the past
7670064 will be delivering the word of americas support and also consulting on how these leaders in the region see the future playing out
7670065 theres been costs in terms of their reputation theres costs in terms of the ability and willingness to do business in russia for example
7670066 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7670067 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7670068 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you
7670069 but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7670070 like most australian financial services companies our results for the last financial year were directly and indirectly impacted by external events
7670071 however underlying business performance and momentum was maintained and we are well placed to ride out any further deterioration in the market as well as take advantage of any improvement in the industry cycle
7670072 thats still a good performance in a deteriorating economic environment
7670073 were very comfortable at the moment with the underlying securities
7670074 its not to say were not watching them very closely though
7670075 certainly the majors have indicated that they would move their rates down
7670076 were not a price setter we usually follow so well follow appropriately
7670077 they obviously had a go at iag and they seem to have moved on from than
7670078 they recently bought pmi a mortgage insurer so i dont know what their strategy is with regards to acquisitions now
7670079 we wouldnt comment on market rumour but were quite confident that our business is performing strongly
7670080 based on the outlook and continuing good progress on integration the board anticipates the groups ordinary dividend for the full year to june 2009 will be maintained at 107 cents per share
7670081 while i understand shareholders will be disappointed by the headline result management responded well to the external challenges we faced our business remains fundamentally sound and the outlook for the current financial year is positive
7670082 we all recall the time harper came to talk about the north and he said you got to use it or lose it
7670083 the people who were living there were asking themselves what does he think weve been doing all these thousands of years
7670084 wonderful opportunity for canada to build on our sovereign claims
7670085 a complete lack of seriousness on the part of the harper government in dealing with the crisis of climate change which is having such a devastating impact across canadas arctic
7670086 if you dont deal with climate change if youre not serious about becoming a world leader on climate change you are directly failing the people of the north
7670087 we can point to the involvement of the accused in many ways
7670088 this threat ruled his behaviour throughout the period of his captivity
7670089 he felt it wasnt worth it to try to escape
7670090 mr dion is essentially refusing to meet and not only refusing to meet refusing to speak by phone
7670091 this is a sign that hes for all intents and purposes broken off communication with the prime minister
7670092 sending canadians into a 400 million federal election wont be decided over the phone or a text message the issues facing canadians are too important
7670093 hes certainly not going to give harper a blank cheque
7670094 in the age of modern communication if somebodys saying they cant find a way to talk to you with cell phones and telephones and the fact that they live in the same city only a handful of blocks apart etc i think youre getting an answer
7670095 i think the key here of course is that the retail banking operations of these banks at least remain stable because that to me is the backbone of these banks
7670096 a lot of the problems that have occurred have been more on the investment banking side and so retail banking is going to be something which should be focused on
7670097 i was trying to stay focussed as well as i could
7670098 its a matter of how fresh i can stay for this tournament
7670099 i want to get some rest and make sure i dont practise as much as i did in beijing i need to save some energy for this tournament
7670100 there have been some great performances from a lot of players this year but we dont have anything like justine who was able to win every single tournament
7670101 in the first set i felt like i was playing against a wall
7670102 in the second set i told myself to just play your game and dont give up
7670103 not that he should have known the rules he did know
7670104 a unique technology that has not been applied successfully to an airplane
7670105 i would have to think that a bumper sticker that said obama the other edwards might have been a bit difficult
7670106 and there was a possible plan to have my name released to the public
7670107 ill let you juxtapose the date of the john edwards expose with when they were about to release my name
7670108 i gave you the aug 10 date when i was told i was on the final short list
7670109 ill leave it to you to draw whatever judgment you want it probably wouldnt be off base if you said something about that time period is exactly when another edwards name jumped on the front page of every newspaper in america
7670110 and then i heard a couple of days later the speaker had talked to several other members of the house
7670111 when i knew this was getting serious was june 30 when i was driving to dallas from waco just outside the city limits of abbott the hometown of willie nelson
7670112 my cell phone rang and he said this is barack obama how are you doing frankly i though it was one of my prankster friends kidding me
7670113 i laughed at one point and said im normally thrilled if anyone remembers what i said 25 minutes after id given a speech
7670114 i never dreamed there would be lawyers being paid to read my speeches from 25 years ago
7670115 they look at every thing and even check whether our children have any kinds of things they should not have on facebook
7670116 from day one we knew that my being a relatively unknown house member from a non swing state would be a major challenge
7670117 after working in the clinton administration in the department of commerce on internet privacy and online commerce issues hunter consulted for five years as an expert on these very same issues at a time of enormous expansion in online banking
7670118 he was not a lobbyist for mbna and his work had absolutely nothing to do with the bankruptcy bill zero nothing
7670119 took plenty of knocks from the largest employer in his state because he demanded changes
7670120 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill
7670121 why didnt we call geri sphatt g spot in high school answer me that
7670122 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
7670123 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
7670124 thats what happens when youre a back up you never know
7670125 all of a sudden your minds elsewhere and bang just like that youre in a game so thats why youve got to be focused on every play and concentrating on what youre doing and be ready you just never know and thats why you need to be prepared
7670126 go to the kitchen and grab a knife you bitch
7670127 no damn it no one is going to make me leave something i love
7670128 symbols are given power by people alone a symbol is meaningless but with enough people a symbol can change the world
7670129 after working in the clinton administration in the department of commerce on internet privacy and online commerce issues hunter consulted for five years as an expert on these very same issues at a time of enormous expansion in online banking
7670130 he was not a lobbyist for mbna and his work had absolutely nothing to do with the bankruptcy bill zero nothing
7670131 took plenty of knocks from the largest employer in his state because he demanded changes
7670132 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill
7670133 they are an obvious attempt to smear the senators character
7670134 shame on all of us for not helping with the project
7670135 after all he has done for us every man woman and child should have chipped in to build our greatest alaskan ever a home the size of the white house
7670136 most importantly however disclosure of the things of value and the negative repercussions flowing from that disclosure would have threatened the defendants future stream of things of value from veco bill allen and others
7670137 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7670138 working with orson was like having a private 12 month film course with orson welles as the teacher
7670139 we would have long chats about film and his experiences in the golden days of hollywood the first thing i ever asked orson was how he got such good performances out of his actors
7670140 i dont want to destroy anybodys life thats not my job
7670141 what really fascinated me was that the photograph that defined him that won him the pulitzer and made him famous was the photograph that really plagued him
7670142 he felt that in taking that photograph he had vilified a decent man
7670143 he would always say nicky you and me our pictures stopped the war
7670144 those are the three most important war pictures ever taken
7670145 those are seared into the mind of anyone who has ever seen them and will be forever those pictures will be as powerful 200 years from now as they were at the time
7670146 like a lot of us who have made pictures of that nature you didnt ever want to have to make that picture in your life
7670147 im sorry i had to make it but it had to be done i think eddies thing was the same
7670148 if you got in his way woe to you because he would just run you over
7670149 and i said wouldnt it be fun to do something on eddie
7670150 yes it is all so phony august 20 2008 said
7670151 that started some bad blood which became an ongoing feud between ms harpel and ms cook
7670152 its not quite as easy as mr manken will have you believe
7670153 in the hardin county treasurers office sometimes two and two didnt always equal four sometimes it was five

7670155 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7670156 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7670157 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7670158 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7670159 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7670160 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7670161 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7670162 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7670163 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7670164 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7670165 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7670166 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7670167 the session of a church should select and appoint godly men and women emphasis mine of the congregation to assist the deacons in caring for the sick the widows the orphans the prisoners and others who may be in any distress or need
7670168 i do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man
7670169 i do permit a woman to teach and exercise authority over a man
7670170 the ordinary and perpetual classes of office in the church are elders and deacons the elders jointly have the government and spiritual oversight of the church including teaching the office of deacon is not one of rule but rather of service both to the physical and spiritual needs of the people in accord with scripture these offices are open to men only
7670171 to the office of deacon which is spiritual in nature shall be chosen men of spiritual character honest repute exemplary lives brotherly spirit warm sympathies and sound judgment
7670172 every church shall elect persons to the offices of ruling elder and deacon in the following manner at such times as determined by the session communicant members of the congregation may submit names to the session keeping in mind that each prospective officer should be an active male member who meets the qualifications set forth in 1 timothy 3 and titus 1
7670173 pick out from among you seven men of good repute full of the spirit and of wisdom whom we will appoint to this duty
7670174 it must be confessed that the biblical warrant for it is of the slenderest we cannot bring ourselves to believe that the apostle means to speak of deaconesses in the midst of the requisites for the deacon in 1 tim iii 11 we find indication of the existence of women deacons in the new testament only in romans xvi 1
7670175 i commend to you our sister phoebe a servant of the church at cenchreae
7670176 phoebe is one of the women memorialized in the new testament by their devoted service to the gospel whose honor is not to be tarnished by elevation to positions and functions inconsistent with the station they occupy in the economy of human relationships
7670177 would require us to assume in that passage a double sudden transition from one subject to another of the harshest and most incredible kind
7670178 if women deacons are in view in v 11 it seems rather strange that they should be discussed right in the middle of the qualifications for male deacons rather than by themselves paul indeed seems to go out of his way to indicate that women are not deacons in the very next verse
7670179 their wives likewise must be dignified not slanderers but sober minded faithful in all things
7670180 women must likewise be dignified not malicious gossips but temperate faithful in all things
7670181 what kind of deaconess or female diaconal assistant does the new testament authorize and the best testimony of church history and historic reformed polity confirm
7670182 goldman was brought in to look at strategic alternatives at how were going to deal with the debt
7670183 we also remind churches that they are free to elect spirit filled women as deaconesses and set them apart by prayer we affirm the right of a local church to have a separate body of unordained women who may be called deaconesses
7670184 valuable and significant material which will be used in the perfecting of the church
7670185 he is using a participial phrase that is consistently used to identify a persons performance of office in the new testament
7670186 the gynaikas wives or women likewise must be worthy of respect not speaking evil of others self controlled and faithful in all things
7670187 sure the rpcna has had women deacons for over a century sure a biblical case can be made but in our cultural climate allowing deaconesses would be disastrous its a slippery slope
7670188 to determine what its complementarianism is going to look like in the future
7670189 everyone knows i love the riddick character and im always working on it

7670196 we had two choices to try to do something or to do nothing
7670197 we had a set of standards it was a crime to let them sit on a shelf
7670198 of no value if your concern is security against insider threats
7670199 as just the epitome of how government money goes down a rat hole
7670200 were not going to sacrifice any of our stringent requirements to satisfy election administrators or manufacturers
7670201 i think were looking forward to working with the board and constituency all across west virginia university as we all come together work together and pick the best president for west virginia university for the upcoming years ahead i think it will go very well

7670213 we got mouths to feed though gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
7670214 they gotta put your face on a 5 000 bill
7670215 we need more transparency particularly with regard to hedge funds and private equity funds they are the ones that are causing this thing to go under and theres no transparency no accountability we dont know how deep this problem is
7670216 from the financial perspective however these funds could be an important source of capital in our global economy wealth funds can bring benefits to our economy theyve helped keep our banks afloat in the midst of the subprime mortgage crisis and ensuing credit crunch they could offer a fresh infusion of capital fuel employment and stimulate the u s industry
7670217 punitive defensive regulation could be self defeating depriving us of potential benefits out of the fear of potential harm
7670218 the thing im most unsure about is how you rationalize competition and trade policy i think thats the single most difficult challenge that i will have as president
7670219 almost as deep in terms of dollars not liability as the savings and loan crisis
7670220 everyone who works for a living will face higher taxes under the democrats

7670226 i felt a wave of hot air sweeping all over me and a terrible smell of burning
7670227 i immediately unfastened the safety belt and fell to the floor the air was cooler there and we could breathe
7670228 theyre stirring up a little hate and discontent with that deal
7670229 it was freer before but we live in a different world now
7670230 this may have been mayberry before but its not anymore
7670231 i have one brother hes american he was born on the u s side i was born on the canadian side
7670232 it hasnt been an easy issue for either side to digest
7670233 but we understand that border patrol and homeland security have a job to do

7670235 im just gonna speak to simon the way i speak to everybody
7670236 im just gonna have my opinion be honest and i dont foresee any problems im really excited about this and up for the challenge
7670237 its really flattering too you know to think that idol even thought about me

7670239 im maybe not a household name but people know of me in the industry
7670240 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7670241 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7670242 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7670243 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7670244 id say i believe in what i believe in and im willing to fight for it and im pretty feisty

7670247 we are very pleased that judge fogel has put content owners on notice ignore fair use at your peril
7670248 in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorised by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
7670249 the dmca already requires copyright owners to make an initial review of the potentially infringing material prior to sending a takedown notice
7670250 indeed it would be impossible to meet any of the requirements of section 512 c without doing so
7670251 in connection with the incident the intruder was able to get a small number of openssh packages relating only to red hat enterprise linux 4 i386 and x86 64 architectures only and red hat enterprise linux 5 x86 64 architecture only signed
7670252 as a precautionary measure we are releasing an updated version of these packages and have published a list of the tampered packages and how to detect them to reiterate our processes and efforts to date indicate that packages obtained by red hat enterprise linux subscribers via red hat network are not at risk
7670253 while there is no definitive evidence that the fedora key has been compromised because fedora packages are distributed via multiple third party mirrors and repositories we have decided to convert to new fedora signing keys
7670254 this may require affirmative steps from every fedora system owner or administrator
7670255 political speech has been threatened repeatedly by claims that controversial material violates a sites terms of use or infringes copyrights or trademark rights
7670256 its really important right now that intermediaries take care not to take down speech improperly
7670257 worrisome because its not clear what the real basis for content removal may be at the end of the day
7670258 when thousands of peoples is riled up to see you that could arouse your ego
7670259 we got mouths to feed though gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
7670260 they gotta put your face on a 5 000 bill
7670261 the environment agency has no staff to oversee those who knowingly flout the weee directive he said
7670262 peace it does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise trouble or hard work it means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart
7670263 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7670264 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7670265 this response ad is more smoke and mirrors from a candidate desperate to obscure his long standing relationship with admitted domestic terrorist william ayers
7670266 senator obama is pretending to barely know the man who hosted the launch of his political career and with whom he has worked for years to advance a liberal agenda
7670267 were being treated by the city of denver and the secret service like political prisoners like pariahs

7670277 one of the things i really like about dr jindrich as a mentor
7670278 is that he takes the time to meet with me regularly to explain concepts and keep me on track
7670279 brian is an excellent student with a very positive attitude and willingness to tackle many different challenges
7670280 we are selectively blocking six different neurotransmitters and investigating the impacts these blockers have on the motor evoked potentials meps
7670281 this project is significant because measuring meps is a safe method for assessing the severity of spinal cord injury sci and evaluating recovery due to emerging treatments for sci
7670282 we seek to test a hypothesis that i developed in the form of a simple mathematical model
7670283 that relates the forces required for maneuvers to a limited set of morphological i e body shape and behavioral parameters
7670284 we will also be measuring velocity and acceleration deceleration using a video system
7670285 we are also considering using emgs to visualize which leg muscles are used in straight line running compared to turns
7670286 i think something that is interesting about me is that i have a wide range of interests

7670297 both india and bangladesh finally exchanged genetic information of its h5n1 strains we have found that both the strains are related however we cant say that bangladesh was the cause of the outbreak in west bengal because we dont have documented proof to show that infected poultry was smuggled into india
7670298 we now know that both the viruses was of clade 2 2 variety which is a sub lineage of the highly pathogenic qinghai strain the strain however is different to the one that caused the manipur and maharashtra outbreaks
7670299 some fear that the partys base was getting eroded by remaining in power considering that the elections are a few months away they feel the party should strengthen itself by resurrecting the hindutva agenda
7670300 christians murdered swamiji but government is lying and giving it a maoist colour naveen as an individual and police in particular are responsible for this attack orchestrated by the church on hindu dharma
7670301 we do not get authentic information from investigating agencies on time whatever action we have taken so far against militant outfits like huji and let along the border were based on media reports
7670302 bdr has maintained that there was no base of any indian insurgent group in its country this time they have however offered to jointly verify the list of camps that we gave them
7670303 the parliament is sovereign and one has to look at the future of pakistans democracy as more important than individuals as such
7670304 we have fought this war for democracy and all the powers that musharraf enjoyed were obviously non democratic we need to have a debate in the parliament and see how strong we want the future president to be and how strong we want to make our prime minister i think the president should not have the power to dissolve the assembly
7670305 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could and the fact that hes launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will
7670306 theres a very serious landmine issue now because there are landmines being laid as we speak theres a whole bunch of things going on right now and as we begin to move refugees from point a to point b or try to feed refugees who are stuck in pockets around the country were now running into the issue of the blowing up of humanitarian vehicles that are trying to get to the refugees so its a whole morass of problems now
7670307 as soon as he saw what was happening he and i we connect on many levels i mean he knew immediately that she would want to go ive been to georgia with him i know the country
7670308 shes on the phone with the world food program hes on the phone with sakaashvili its like this great picture of what theyll be like in the white house
7670309 how did she do it how did she stop dieting
7670310 really the choice of joe biden in my opinion is tantamount to an admission barack obama himself lacks the necessary experience to be president
7670311 but we can confirm that all resident local families with young children are eligible for certain benefits
7670312 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7670313 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7670314 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7670315 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7670316 my agent called me and he said you are on a short list to be the
7670317 but you know i guess they saw something about me that they thought was good and they wanted to put somebody who was from the industry on the show and so i got the job
7670318 today people expect more content and more detail about events as they happen through the it infrastructure that atos origin has designed built and operated during the beijing 2008 olympic games the competition results have been viewed and read by more people and on more channels web mobile phone and tv than ever before
7670319 the squeaking wheel doesnt always get the grease sometimes it gets replaced
7670320 i really dont want to say what the situation is
7670321 there is some situation some things that are going on
7670322 i thought it was about time to let you in on what has been going on with
7670323 on thursday morning august 28 we will all leave sweden for five days in belarus and ukraine together with a reporter from a well known swedish rock magazine hes travelling with us to document everything we do and everything that happens what ever happens dont know if this is a good idea but we already sense that this journey will be something special there for we will revive our old road book that youll find at www mobilblogg nu pain so that you easily can follow our trial and errors nevertheless what you dont find out in the road book you can easily read in next months issue of close up magazine
7670324 eleven gems offering a vast variety of styles and influences which are even new for pain
7670325 political speech has been threatened repeatedly by claims that controversial material violates a sites terms of use or infringes copyrights or trademark rights
7670326 its really important right now that intermediaries take care not to take down speech improperly
7670327 worrisome because its not clear what the real basis for content removal may be at the end of the day
7670328 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7670329 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7670330 i am surrounded by friends and family and feel safe and secure
7670331 i blame myself for not saving mohammed but where i come from we are not used to this kind of thing happening at home we never need to defend ourselves like that
7670332 after i asked them to leave i noticed a police car pull up outside so i went over and spoke to the officers i asked them to keep an eye on the boys and they said they would then left less than an hour later mohammed who was like a brother to everyone here had been beaten the attack was completely unprovoked and without reason
7670333 this incident will be disastrous for britains relationship with the united arab emirates what parent will want to send their children here for the summer when they know things like this are happening
7670334 we are all deeply shocked at whats happened mohammed was everyones friend we cannot believe something like this could happen we will never come back here
7670335 the young man was a visitor to hastings and his death is tragic our thoughts are with his family
7670336 were here to tell people dont put all your hopes in obama
7670337 theres one candidate about change and the other ones not
7670338 in no way appropriate to either calming or defusing tensions
7670339 if they choose to break off this relationship even the whole of it nothing terrible will happen
7670340 my guess is that this vote is a means to achieve better conditions for international negotiations
7670341 if it does this russia will further isolate itself from the entire world and will force the international community to seek more active ways to restore the territorial integrity of georgia
7670342 the fact that there are nine western warships in the black sea cannot but be a cause for concern
7670343 aq is not the only extremist ideology of interest or concern domestically or overseas but countering the aq threat is a counterterrorism priority and requires aq centric communications efforts
7670344 it the narrative combines fact fiction emotion and religion and manipulates discontent about local and international issues the narrative is simple flexible and infinitely accommodating it can be adapted to suit local conditions and may have a disproportionate influence on understanding and interpretation of local or global events
7670345 the objective is not to dismiss grievances but undermine aqs position as their champion and violent extremism as the solution
7670346 our first tailored product with key arguments exposing the theme aq is losing support
7670347 this series of guidance alone will not fatally undermine the aq narrative but it can increase our impact against the narrative while we develop a bespoke and hard hitting campaign using private sector resources
7670348 we are in negotiations with several major communications companies to design and deliver high impact campaigns across media and non media channels
7670349 push these message themes to a wide range of contacts
7670350 if it looks too much like government propaganda then i dont think people are going to listen nor should they
7670351 mr speaker sir this is a truly historic event and i would like on behalf of the president our party and this side of this august house to congratulate you
7670352 my father was a shift worker a worker for the city all his life
7670353 no silver spoons no magic just parents who tried their best to leave the next generation just a little bit better off
7670354 the values that drive him experiences that shaped him and why i believe he will be an extraordinary president ill also share stories about my life and my background with the country
7670355 youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids and i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7670356 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7670357 while there is not a stable government in islamabad then the law and order situation in nwfp and the federally administered tribal areas fata will not be solved
7670358 saving lives should be the first issue then we can look at the judges
7670359 are we now a laughing stock for those who didnt want democracy in pakistan for them its a victory but were both losers
7670360 i think it recognises the importance of her race of 18 million people voting for her
7670361 he is going to have to reinforce his capacity for leadership
7670362 we will be looking for cues in what she says
7670363 the last few times she expressed support for obama people picked up that she still wants delegates to fight for her
7670364 my sense is that we will lose hundreds of delegates
7670365 i think after the election many of her supporters female and male were in mourning
7670366 you will see many women in the barack administration i know they are reaching out and compiling lists of competent women
7670367 im not very keen im not going to raise funds im not going to phone bank for him but i will vote
7670368 today people expect more content and more detail about events as they happen through the it infrastructure that atos origin has designed built and operated during the beijing 2008 olympic games the competition results have been viewed and read by more people and on more channels web mobile phone and tv than ever before
7670369 the squeaking wheel doesnt always get the grease sometimes it gets replaced
7670370 the main reason given for lifting the ban is that the general public is much more outspoken and broadminded than it was and that to ventilate vice and its tragedies would be to the general social advantage
7670371 the subject will be very distasteful and embarrassing in mixed company of all ages and also that the introduction in plays of new vices might start an unfortunate train of thought in the previously innocent
7670372 for some time the subject of homosexuality has been so widely debated written about that it is no longer justifiable to continue the strict exclusion of this subject from the stage
7670373 we would not pass a play that was violently pro homosexual
7670374 we would not allow funny innuendo or jokes on the subject
7670375 we will not allow embraces between males of practical demonstrations of love
7670376 we will allow the word pansy but not the word bugger
7670377 in terms of censorship of representations of homosexuality it became almost a mania it was as much about latching on to one example of the new permissiveness that developed in the postwar years and seeing in it all the ills of a new world that the retired air force colonels found it hard to understand and instinctively opposed
7670378 it was a time of change but often incremental change and of compromises between old and new guard the old guard was more tenacious than might have been supposed and the new guard was prepared to work within existing systems as well as blazing new ground
7670379 as requested the line worn out but still a few good pumps in her will be omitted
7670380 ive read it and i think its revolting quite apart from the homosexual bits to me it has no saving grace whatsoever if we pass muck like this it does underlined give our critics something to go on
7670381 throughout there runs a rare vitality and with experience and greater conciseness one feels mr pinter may well make some impact as a dramatist
7670382 cannot understand why the younger generation instead of knocking on the door should bash the fuck out of it
7670383 it was as if the theatre were being censored by disgusted of tunbridge wells
7670384 he was born prematurely at less than eight months he wasnt very strong so we spent all our money seeking treatment for him
7670385 we had so many hopes and expectations for him he was the source of all our mental strength we didnt expect him to be a great man but we hoped he would be a good one now we hope the government can give us a satisfactory explanation and justice
7670386 now they do not even allow us to gather together
7670387 the officials asked us to be patient they told us we need to support the olympics and after the olympics they will sort this out but we have been waiting for such a long time i guess they hope that if the time is long enough we will just forget this
7670388 they dont see the point of speaking to the foreign media they dont think its helped
7670389 the public security bureau were waiting for our representatives when they went to buy tickets at the station i think they must have a list of us all because they knew who they were and told them not to go they have told us not to make trouble
7670390 we dont want compensation we just want someone held accountable we dont want this to happen again
7670391 we are not pursuing wealth we just need justice we want the people who deserve it to be punished
7670392 but they were extremely eager that we would sign they forced and deceived us the officials stayed in our rooms until 11pm or 12pm and they told us that others all signed this and if you did not sign you would be the only person who got nothing
7670393 so we signed and the next day we found that they told everybody this we found out that we had been cheated they got rid of the evidence the wreckage of the school which they levelled they said they had to do it to prevent infectious diseases but it was just because it showed that the building was dangerous my child should not have died
7670394 i thought the government would give us justice but it now seems that is impossible
7670395 some people still tell us that the government will solve this but most of us think that theyve been bought by officials i havent cried in the last three months but i do now before i thought the government would help us and if we had any trouble we could go to them but when we went to them there was no one there
7670396 there was no one person clearly responsible for the incident you would need to overhaul the whole system
7670397 the government gives signs that its serious and transparent and more accountable but then these efforts fade away
7670398 is the absence of a free press to keep the issue in the headlines the incentive for finding out things that are going to embarrass you is just not there a second is local inertia once central government officials have left and the issue is not in their minds the provincial bureaucracy reasserts itself in the old ways its a problem we have with a lot of positive steps the government takes
7670399 extremely safe and solid structures the public can feel reassured about
7670400 please tell me where i can buy a split or 2 chamber crock pot do you know the name brand of one youve seen in a store
7670401 bacteria feed off of sweat and skin cells and that is what creates some of the body odor
7670402 secara historis selalu sulit bagi kami setiap bermain di fratton park tahun lalu kami hanya bermain seri setahun sebelumnya kami malah kalah maka kemenangan ini adalah sebuah bonus
7670403 saya kira kami bermain cukup bagus kami banyak bergantung kepada anderson setelah perjalanan jauh dia menyatakan ingin tampil dan saya kira dia membuktikan kemampuannya
7670404 kami berusaha membuat sistem permainan di mana setiap pemain bisa tampil dengan nyaman di posisinya anderson di tengah dekat carlos tevez paul scholes yang mengatur permainan dan dia sukses kemudian john oshea dan darren fletcher menunjukkan kualitas terbaiknya
7670405 dia selalu berlari mengejar bola di babak kedua dia lebih hebat dia merusak permainan lawan juga membuka peluang buat wayne rooney dia memang punya energi yang fantastis saya sangat senang dengannya dan dia berhak menjadi bagian dari mu
7670406 kalau biasanya mau makan seafood orang pasti ke muara karang atau kepikirnya muara karang sekarang kita ingin pluit juga jadi ikon untuk seafood
7670407 having committed to obama it struck me that i might as well be vigorous in that commitment
7670408 i have no doubt that this is a very awkward thing for me
7670409 but as a private citizen now not an office holder my only obligation is to do whats in the best interest of public policy
7670410 i am simply going to lay out a historical and philosophical framework for why i think there should be a new approach to the issues of the day and why i think barack obama fits the challenges of the moment
7670411 respects very much the contributions to our society that john mccain has made
7670412 i thought he was hired as a decoy or something
7670413 we send him onto the streets and people follow him around
7670414 instructed in all things it is in my thought to give you some advice this writing for i have heard you say several times that you remember my words better than those of any one else
7670415 isnt getting dirty and fucking a mechanic right there in the garage every womans secret fantasy
7670416 what was i thinking about while i was taking these pictures
7670417 i think men are really scared when they dont know me
7670418 i also wondered how you choose what type of yarn to match with the color
7670419 which is your favorite of the base yarns to dye
7670420 will you be repeating any of the favorite most popular colorways from the past
7670421 and a bit more personal what do you think is the most valuable life lesson you have learned
7670422 what content yarn is your favorite to dye cashmere angora any particular type of wool bfl
7670423 i love that pic of the sunflower is that in your yard
7670424 how is your new studio working out for you can we see it
7670425 what does mr plucky think of us crazy yarn ladies
7670426 how is your new dyeing area working out everything you hoped for
7670427 have you ever created a colorway and then really disliked it
7670428 why are you keeping two plucky shops one on etsy and the other by iself
7670429 i know you listen to books driving and or dyeing whats your most recent enjoyable listen read
7670430 im clueless as to what would be best for a project for example if i were to make fingerless gloves which yarn would you recommend i use i like super soft stuff
7670431 the yarn always smells so nice and feels so soft do you use a special rinse
7670432 my boyfriend is always telling me im beautiful and sexy and stuff like that but hed better seeing as i give him sex
7670433 saya memiliki impian suatu hari bangsa ini akan bangkit dan mewujudkan arti sebenarnya dari kredo yang dipegang
7670434 the point of departure for the exchange of ideas opinions and passions that are the fundamental criteria of useful civic conversation the function of interpretation was understood as both a cultural duty and a cultural right the play was one part of a larger learning operation in which the audiences collective and individual reception would invariably shape the ascribed meaning
7670435 theater provides the most effective way to communicate the ideas and principles of society and the most immediate way to challenge and experience what is considered funny important horrifying and so on theater is a way for an audience to find out what feelings are shared or not shared with most people

7670438 it is clear the m d c are on top of the situation after winning the speakers post

7670440 google looks as if its on top of the world right now holding an ever increasing lions share of the search market the way it treats its employees writes preston gralla another example google employees such as sergey solyanik have started deserting the company and its share price is down double that of the dow or nasdaq since november 2007 even if google has lost its mojo why should you care it wont make your searches any less effective will it nope but google has its eyes on bigger things than search notably your it department its looking to displace microsoft with hosted services like google apps gmail and google docs solyanik warns that googles engineers care more about the coolness of a service than about the services effectiveness
7670441 omg war is not solo casual friendly zomg its a wow clone here we go again

7670445 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
7670446 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
7670447 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
7670448 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
7670449 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
7670450 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
7670451 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
7670452 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
7670453 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
7670454 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
7670455 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
7670456 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
7670457 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
7670458 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
7670459 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
7670460 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
7670461 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question

7670530 on june 19 2008 the supreme court of the u s issued a decision in which it held that a higher standard must be used to determine defendants competence to represent themselves in criminal cases than the test used to determine the accuseds competence to stand trial plainly speaking this means that while a mentally ill defendant can be found competent to stand trial it does not necessarily follow that they can competently represent themselves as their own counsel fundamentally this could be viewed as a negative decision for the mentally ill one of our constitutional rights is self representation in court we are allowed to tell our story the way we want it told and to plead our case in a manner that we believe is in our own best interest now most of us would do a pretty terrible job of maneuvering ourselves through a court case but sometimes taking your lawyers advice doesnt turn out as youd hoped i have heard defendants ask why didnt my lawyer do this or why didnt they say that sometimes juries will express why didnt we hear from the defendant i want to hear his version of the story not speaking for yourself is not always the right decision it becomes very complicated in a case where the defendant is floridly psychotic hearing voices speaking in gibberish nothing useful will come from that defendant trying to conduct his own trial the court process becomes derailed and nothing good is accomplished for either the defense or the prosecution often the defendant by his very mental state convicts himself with little effort by the prosecution but does it make sense to allow someone to be competent to stand trial and yet too ill to represent themselves most courtrooms are all too ready to allow a mentally ill defendant to be tried recently the supreme court of the united states said yes in the indiana v edwards decision in july 1999 ahmad edwards was discovered trying to steal a pair of shoes from an indiana department store after being discovered he fired a gun at a store security officer and wounded a bystander he was charged with attempted murder battery with a deadly weapon criminal recklessness and theft he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and subsequently found incompetent to stand trial and was committed to a state psychiatric hospital for further evaluation and treatment his competency and mental status fluctuated over the course of five years and he was not found competent to proceed to trial until july 2004 in june 2005 edwards stood trial he asked to represent himself but the trial court rejected this request and the jury found him guilty of criminal recklessness and theft but failed to reach a verdict on the charges of attempted murder and battery the state decided to retry him on the attempted murder and battery charges and he was retried in december 2005 the trial court again found that he was competent to stand trial but not competent to represent himself despite being represented by counsel at his retrial the jury convicted him on both counts edwards appealed arguing that he had been wrongfully deprived of his constitutional right to represent himself the case eventually reached the supreme court which addressed the legal question of whether the standard for allowing defendants to represent themselves at trial should be higher than the standard for finding defendants competent to stand trial the court decided that there was a higher standard for representing yourself than the standard for competency to be found competent to stand trial you must be able to consult with your attorney with a reasonable degree of rational understanding this means in general that you are able to know what you have been charged with be able to consult in formulating your own defense and be able to explain the nature of the pleas involved in an interesting aside andrea yates was found competent to stand trial although she initially wanted to plead guilty so that she would be executed by the state which was the only entity who could kill satan inside of her she understood the plea but her psychosis was unable to initially allow her to follow her lawyers advice the edwards decision states that to be competent to represent yourself you must have the ability for organization of defense making motions arguing points of law questioning witnesses and addressing the court and jury the court is stating that those that are mentally ill may be well enough be found competent but still not be able to represent themselves while this may appear to be taking away the rights from persons with a disability it may be ultimately in their best legal defense the court also comments on the humaneness of the decision a right of self representation at trial will not affirm the dignity of a defendant who lacks the mental capacity to conduct his defense without the assistance of counsel justice stephen g breyer wrote to the contrary given that defendants uncertain mental state the spectacle that could well result from his self representation at trial is at least as likely to prove humiliating as ennobling the united states has long struggled with the treatment of the mentally ill from locking them up in sanitariums for years to locking them up in jails no one knows quite what to do with the mentally ill defendant who although it may be obvious that theyve committed a crime its also obvious that they are seriously disturbed in houston alone it is estimated that some 50 of the inmates in the juvenile justice system are seriously and chronically mentally ill jail is not a great treatment for a psychiatric disorder texas in particular has struggled with the death penalty and the mentally ill criminal we have had a history of executing those with known documented and profound psychotic illness this is an embarrassment for our state and a terrible example for respecting human rights this ruling by the united states supreme court is a very small step forward in assuring that those who commit crimes and are suffering from mental illness have both their rights protected and receive fair trails sic what to do with a mentally ill defendant after conviction is the topic of another blog i look forward to sharing my thoughts on a very complicated issue

7670546 solo l8 per cento nellultimo anno non si e ubriacato
7670547 but each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey i come here tonight as a sister blessed with a brother who is my mentor my protector and my lifelong friend i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion and her intelligence reflected in my own daughters
7670548 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7670549 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love

7670621 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

7670635 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7670636 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7670637 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7670638 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7670639 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7670640 clinton herself has suggested that the party needs a cathartic moment to cleanse any remaining bad blood between the two camps
7670641 if the obama can come out of denver with even a little more enthusiasm from clinton supporters it will be a victory
7670642 you watch your budget i used to run over here all the time for everything i watch it now
7670643 i look before i pull in there are a couple that i monitor
7670644 i wish it would stay but i think they are doing it for the election or something
7670645 any trader or investor who ignores the power of macroeconomics over the worlds financial markets will sooner or later lose more than they should and if they are trading on margin perhaps more than they have
7670646 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7670647 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7670648 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7670649 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7670650 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7670651 cher is nolans first choice to play catwoman he wants to her to portray her like a vamp in her twilight years
7670652 the new catwoman will be the absolute opposite of michelle pfeiffer and halle berrys purring creations
7670653 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7670654 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7670655 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7670656 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7670657 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7670658 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7670659 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7670660 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7670661 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7670662 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7670663 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7670664 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7670665 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7670666 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7670667 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

7670672 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7670673 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7670674 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7670675 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7670676 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7670677 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7670678 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7670679 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7670680 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7670681 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7670682 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7670683 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7670684 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7670685 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7670686 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7670687 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7670688 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7670689 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7670690 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7670691 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7670692 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7670693 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7670694 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7670695 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7670696 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7670697 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7670698 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

7670700 democrats have been are and will continue to be people of faith and this convention will demonstrate that in an unprecedented way
7670701 as convention ceo and a pastor myself i am incredibly proud that so many esteemed leaders from the faith community will be with us to celebrate this historic occasion and honor the diverse faith traditions inside the democratic party
7670702 faith in 2009 how an obama administration will engage people of faith
7670703 new faith voters what it means for this election and the country
7670704 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7670705 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7670706 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7670707 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7670708 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7670709 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7670710 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7670711 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7670712 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7670713 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7670714 who are open to doing something on the production side
7670715 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7670716 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7670717 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7670718 the council or its agents to make inquiries to corroborate this claim
7670719 councils will naturally wish to ensure council tax discounts and benefits are not wrongly claimed but i am concerned that innocent citizens will be spied on through heavy handed and disproportionate use of town hall snoopers
7670720 there are far less intrusive and more cost effective ways of vetting council tax than paying town hall officials to camp overnight outside peoples homes
7670721 the intrusiveness of the surveillance is kept to a minimum only doing the least amount necessary to obtain the information required
7670722 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
7670723 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
7670724 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7670725 its not a starvation its just a specific sort of remodeling of the cells metabolism in a way that also causes the organism to live longer
7670726 it is interesting that yeast on calorie restriction produce just as much atp as well fed ones
7670727 there is renewed interest in mitochondria as researchers discover their key role in mediating the effects of caloric restriction and resistance to diseases of aging such as diabetes and neurodegeneration
7670728 it protects the cells because it protects proteins from aggregating
7670729 if i give you my ball will i get it back or will you lose it
7670730 the agencys investment targets now include 40 percent fixed income 39 percent equities 10 percent real estate and private equity 6 percent alternative equities and 5 percent alternative fixed income
7670731 it seems like you dont get it if the sample was untestable or if their wasnt enough argon to be tested they would have said so apparently their was enough apparently the test dosent work plus if they lost argon as you stated that would make the rock even younger and it was crushed into smaller rocks per their instructions why not go to there site and look at their rules for submitting samples also i emailed the office manager so hopefully we can get this sorted out as soon as he responds i called earlier but they didnt open untill noon ill try again later

7670738 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7670739 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7670740 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7670741 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7670742 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7670743 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7670744 how many berries can we stuff in our faces before we throw up
7670745 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7670746 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7670747 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7670748 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7670749 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7670750 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
7670751 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7670752 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7670753 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7670754 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7670755 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7670756 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7670757 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7670758 rightly or mistakenly theres a suspicion that selected banks will announce another round of write offs
7670759 second banks are coming to grips with the reality of the global slowdown the slowdown suggests reduced revenue for banks which would further injured already strained balance sheets and make banks more reluctant to lend
7670760 only after banks become confident in those theyre lending to so long as banks believe some in their sector may be hiding losses the bias will be toward pulling back lending activity and thats reflected in higher rates

7670778 chairman genuino possesses managerial acumen and experience qualities that informed voters want from their leaders
7670779 proof of such acumen is his unparalleled success at the helm of pagcor and his vision of an entertainment city that is to rise on prime reclaimed land in pasay city and make the country a major tourist and entertainment destination in asia

7670783 studies consistently confirm that many sick children do not reach health facilities and children from poorer families are even less likely to obtain care
7670784 many children never make it to the treatment stage often because their caregivers are not aware of the symptoms of pneumonia

7670788 global trading conditions for wine continue to be competitive but the category remains in solid growth
7670789 we have not been immune from industry wide pressures including an economic slowdown in key markets and higher grape prices
7670790 foreign exchange movements in the 12 months to 30 june 2008 cut wine earnings by approximately 70 million and wine growth by 14 6 percentage points

7670799 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognise these separatist regions
7670800 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7670801 the united states will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7670802 recognition would also be inconsistent with unanimously approved united nations security council resolutions that russia has consistently voted for in the past
7670803 will be delivering the word of americas support and also consulting on how these leaders in the region see the future playing out

7670820 bull or bear call it what you will the fate of precious metals seems to rest with the u s and european economies and the extent to which the monetary base will have to be inflated to prevent a deflationary spiral the rally off the july 15 lows in stocks has shown the market tends to overreact in these situations and in this case the cause for the selloff is rather tenuous at best and based on some uncertain assumptions

7670822 if we see banks becoming very dependent on central banks then we must push them to tap other sources of funding
7670823 nobody dares pinpoint the country involved because as soon as we do it will cause a market reaction and lead to a meltdown for the banks
7670824 the trade against oil and the euro is looking overdone at least in the short term and the equity versus commodities trade next week bears some careful monitoring
7670825 the banks think that they have established the principle that if they over borrow enough if they are reckless enough if they expand enough they become
7670826 cycles in capital flows to emerging markets have now been with us for two hundred years
7670827 i was a high class muscleman for big business for wall street and for the bankers
7670828 in short i was a racketeer a gangster for capitalism
7670829 i helped make mexico especially tampico safe for american oil interests in 1914 i helped make haiti and cuba a decent place for the national city bank boys to collect revenues in i helped in the raping of half a dozen central american republics for the benefit of wall street the record of racketeering is long i helped purify nicaragua for the international banking house of brown brothers in 1909 1912 i brought light to the dominican republic for american sugar interests in 1916 in china i helped to see to it that standard oil went its way unmolested
7670830 i was contacted by a woman named claudine who became my trainer as an economic hit man
7670831 she said she was sent to help me and to train me
7670832 she is extremely beautiful sensual seductive intelligent her job was to convince me to become an economic hit man holding out these three drugs sex drugs and money and then she wanted to let me know that i was getting into a dirty business and i shouldnt go off on my first assignment which was going to be indonesia and start doing this unless i knew that i was going to continue doing it and once i was in i was in for life
7670833 the system is set up such that the countries are so deep in debt that they cant repay their debt
7670834 when the u s government wants favors from them like votes in the united nations or troops in iraq or in many many cases their resources their oil their canal in the case of panama we go to them and say look you cant pay off your debts therefore sell your oil at a very low price to our oil companies today tremendous pressure is being put on ecuador for example to sell off its amazonian rainforest very precious very fragile places inhabited by indigenous people whose cultures are being destroyed by the oil companies
7670835 at that first meeting the president of the company mentioned some of the books that i had written about indigenous people and said thats nice thats fine keep doing your non profit work
7670836 we approve of that but you certainly would never write about this industry would you and i assured him that i wouldnt
7670837 how to survive the crisis and profit in the process
7670838 weve laid out our principles quite clearly in relation to the use of private sector capital for roading projects and for investment in infrastucture
7670839 look isnt it romantic i can see that youre hurting why did you mess with mothers grave
7670840 i thought you and your mother would like othello to rest there with her
7670841 he was just a pet its not like losing mother
7670842 oh willow no one would have left you to do that alone
7670843 you did you did it alone why is it ok for you and not for me
7670844 willow part of what youre experiencing is culture shock you and your mother had your own culture her death plunged you into another culture theyre closely related but whereas you and your mother valued grit and independence we like to serve others especially when they are hurting

7670847 los dos son grandes jugadores a messi le falta la experiencia y ganar lo que gan diego pero va en camino
7670848 lionel se sinti de la mejor manera como lo demostr en el campeonato y bienvenido que sea argentino

7670850 me siento muy contento de estar aqu en pumas el tuca
7670851 all no nos fue bien pero ahora esperamos sacar un buen resultado que es a lo que vamos y a levantar la mano para ser tomados en cuenta
7670852 siempre es importante el primer paso pero lo m s dif cil ahora viene y es seguir compitiendo con la gente de experiencia con los titulares pero siempre con la disposici n de seguir trabajando y ayudar al equipo
7670853 pana in prezent s au inscris cateva sute de oameni daca sa zicem s ar inscrie undeva la 3 000 am putea spune ca ajungem undeva la break even dar nu cred ca acest lucru se va intampla la acest meci
7670854 en un principio estos juegos fueron creados para promover la educaci n en torno al paciente asm tico adem s de que se aprovechaba la oportunidad de promover la pr ctica del deporte
7670855 y el ejemplo m s grande lo tenemos con mark spitz quien a pesar de sus condiciones logr ganar siete medallas de oro en los juegos ol mpicos de munich 72
7670856 ahora es mucho m s f cil tratar y controlar esta enfermedad que hasta hace unos a os hac a que en ocasiones quien la padec a o pasaba por una crisis estuviera hospitalizado varias semanas
7670857 creo que los dos torneos son muy valiosos y son importantes y el premio por ganar el de la concacaf es interesante y ello le ha dado un plus
7670858 conseguir el boleto al mundial de clubes en donde se puede enfrentar a los mejores equipos del mundo es un sue o que todos tenemos hoy este torneo es una vitrina muy importante y lo vamos a tomar con seriedad
7670859 sabemos que estamos en un repechaje y hay que superarlo despu s de aqu a diciembre en el torneo local debemos quedar entre los mejores cuatro y hacer todo por dar el paso que no pudimos en la final pasada
7670860 yo no hablo de golear hablo de jugar bien y de tratar de hacer lo mejor si se da una goleada eso es extra no s si ser dif cil el duelo de ma ana como les digo no conocemos nada del rival ni sus condiciones futbol sticas
7670861 pital a es un peleador muy duro por eso me estoy preparando al m ximo para esta pelea estoy agradecido porque me dan la oportunidad de este combate y voy a dar el m ximo porque s que en esta pelea puede quedar santa cruz
7670862 esta pelea puede ser mi fin y no quiero eso voy a prepararme muy bien vengo a morir en el ring ah se determinar si sigo o no
7670863 no quiero desaprovechar esta oportunidad porque ser a la ltima para m por la edad que tengo 38 a os es el ltimo tren y no lo voy a dejar pasar
7670864 mi sue o desde que sal de colombia fue el de regresar como campe n del mundo y sta es la oportunidad para ir por un t tulo entonces la voy a aprovechar al m ximo
7670865 se est reuniendo casi a diario para tener el mejor equipo posible
7670866 hay que esperar pero realmente estamos en tiempo y forma para las cuestiones administrativas
7670867 lo que hacemos ahora es tratar a todo mundo como disponible para que el t cnico pueda determinar la lista final y hasta entonces movernos para saber si es dosificado o no eso es algo que se platica internamente
7670868 s por supuesto que es una ventaja que siempre debemos considerar y juega a favor
7670869 es parte de unas ventajas que podemos tener es parte de nuestra disyuntiva el saber en qu momento y en qu partido poder salir del estadio azteca porque sabemos que hay ventajas
7670870 el estadio azteca por la magnitud es un tema a favor y suma entonces as lo tratamos de manejar las ventajas que tenemos en el distrito federal todo mundo las puede ver pero hay otras ventajas en otras plazas que tambi n pesan
7670871 the only limits you have are the ones you place on yourself
7670872 in todays world its great to have athlete that can be the role model we need not only for his physical prowess but also for how he thinks and acts its truly a breath of fresh air
7670873 quisiera agradecer a quienes han cre do en este proyecto y nos han acompa ado desde el principio pues sin ellos no ser a posible el creciente inter s que hay en el futbol femenino
7670874 si una ni a juega bien en el mundial sub 20 no digan juega como hombre
7670875 estar n listos y dejar n sin palabras a los m s pesimistas
7670876 cuando me han preguntado qu pienso de los chilenos destaco su trabajo orden y respeto por las normas

7670883 escuchaba que hab a pesimismo por el 0 0 pero nosotros lo vemos de una manera diferente sabemos que el gol visitante cuenta mucho y nosotros no jugamos mal de visitante por lo general fuera de casa hacemos gol y eso nos da la ilusi n de que podemos avanzar
7670884 sabemos a que equipo nos vamos a enfrentar pero lo haremos sin ning n tipo de miedo o de temor
7670885 por lo que le pas a lafita desgraciadamente se abri una oportunidad para m y la estoy afrontando con la ilusi n de ganarme la titularidad poco a poco todos somos conscientes de que la competencia est m s fuerte este a o que el pasado y nadie se quiere quedar fuera
7670886 en la copa sudamericana es distinto es a muerte como se dice y es ida y vuelta y hay que saber jugar el partido de ida y hacerlo de la mejor manera para poder culminar ac
7670887 aparte de que aprendimos del arsenal ya no hay rivales a modo ser a tonto pensar que es as una cosa es que no se tenga conocimiento del rival y que a lo mejor el nombre no te diga mucho pero lo respetamos y vamos a tratar de buscar un resultado
7670888 espero un partido muy fuerte ser fuerte porque todo mundo ha crecido en el futbol venezuela as ha sido entonces va a ser complicado como todos los partidos
7670889 me falta recuperar confianza para volver a mi mejor juego
7670890 me falta coger confianza para volver a mi mejor juego ltimamente estoy jugando pocos partidos y no termino de coger la confianza y el ritmo necesario pero voy a entrenar a full para recuperarme lo antes posible

7670893 ya estamos en la etapa final de la preparaci n pura rapidez para dar el peso el viernes y ya pasando el peso para m no hay ning n problema estamos preparados f sica y mentalmente para ganar
7670894 me siento motivad simo estamos cerca de la laguna viene bastante gente para apoyarme ese d a juega santos contra monterrey en partido de futbol va a haber muchos laguneros y regiomontanos entonces creo que va a ir gente a apoyarme gracias a dios
7670895 en su momento se tomaron decisiones que pudieron ofender a unos y beneficiar a otros pero se hizo por el bien de todos
7670896 ahora s lo quiero ayudar al equipo y ganar t tulos con el bar a y no cambiar a por nada del mundo mi situaci n
7670897 tengo 27 a os y llevo mucho tiempo jugando al f tbol de la misma manera ahora no voy a cambiar ya que mi forma de jugar me llev al bar a y a conseguir muchos xitos
7670898 cada partido es un mundo pero en el bar a se nos exige ganar y si es posible jugando bien por respeto al rival a la gente que asistir al campo y a nuestra afici n nuestra obligaci n es salir a por la victoria personalmente me ilusiona en cada partido defender la camiseta del bar a

7670915 strippy pauls letter to the thessalonians is really for a greek audience
7670916 someone in this congregation has spread a rumor that i belong to the ku klux klan this is a horrible lie and one which a christian community cannot tolerate i am embarrassed and do not intend to accept this now i want the party who did this to stand and ask forgiveness from god and this christian family
7670917 do you have the nerve to face me and admit this is a falsehood remember you will be forgiven and in your heart you will feel glory now stand and confess your transgression
7670918 reverend there has been a terrible misunderstanding i never said you were a member of the ku klux klan i simply told a couple of my friends that you were a wizard under the sheets
7670919 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7670920 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7670921 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7670922 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7670923 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7670924 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7670925 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7670926 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7670927 the air force has increased the sheer volume of pilots put through the training pipeline and shipped them off to war with the bare minimum training required
7670928 have come directly from basic training as their first exposure to the professional workforce
7670929 this is stuff we can correct through training stuff that happens between the ears
7670930 flight safety is of paramount importance to the air force and every mishap is carefully studied in order to mitigate future risk

7670939 while metallica are over there singing about the horned one this is a song about wakefield
7670940 we must embrace the new reality which is that lebanon is a separate and sovereign country they dont want us
7670941 in our view this data is a strong indicator that performance of the mobile carriers network is affecting the iphone 3g more than the handset itself
7670942 altogether this furthers our thesis that its highly unlikely that apple is going to wave a magic wand and say 3g problems be gone with a software update
7670943 it should come as no surprise that a large majority of americans perceive senator obama as receiving more favorable media treatment compared to senator mccain obama is a fresh young and charismatic political figure any politician who is routinely compared to john f kennedy and bobby kennedy as obama has been will surely cultivate support among journalists this will change however once the nominating conventions are over and the general election campaign begins the euphoria will subside and we are likely to see more balanced coverage
7670944 when just 6 3 of those surveyed were unsure about the balance of media coverage for the candidates its a good indication it is obvious to americans but maybe not to the national media
7670945 more than two fifths 44 8 told our researchers that they would be very or somewhat likely to support a strong third party candidate if one emerged this has to be unsettling to both candidates
7670946 with respect to the poll concerning support for third parties it is not at all unusual to find a substantial portion of the electorate indicating displeasure with the nominees of the two major parties and a willingness to vote for a third party candidate this is a fairly typical finding
7670947 however when given the opportunity to actually vote for a third party candidate the vast majority of these disenchanted respondents will balk at the opportunity and cast their vote for either the democratic or republican candidate a good number of those persons polled who supported none of the above will also vote for one of the two major party candidates the united states has been a two party system since the beginning of the republic and this will not change any time soon
7670948 the mental illness called paranoid schizophrenia or paranoia for short is essentially an exaggerated form of ego

7670951 it should be emphasised that the mood of irish consumers still remains very gloomy but this months results suggest that although confidence is fragile consumers are at least capable of taking comfort in a number of slightly encouraging developments
7670952 the fact that consumers noted a couple of encouraging developments in the past month suggests they havent entirely given up hope this openness to good news while encouraging also raises the question as to where more positive noises might come from
7670953 this increases the pressure on the irish government to come up with a credible response to current problems before long
7670954 the small improvement in consumer sentiment while welcome shouldnt be thought of as signalling a turnaround
7670955 current readings remain consistent with extremely weak levels of household spending however the fact that irish consumers remain capable of discerning good news in the shape of heavy price discounts by retailers lower oil prices or more favourable news on interest rates is a welcome development
7670956 it is probably premature to conclude that the worst news on inflation is behind us
7670957 it is a close strategic fit with our core areas of expertise in whey and sports nutrition and brings us up the value chain into consumer markets
7670958 optimum also fits very well with the groups stated growth strategy and ambition to continue to internationalise our business the transaction is expected to be earnings enhancing from this year
7670959 the company has strong brands and a broad distribution network in an attractive market segment we have a long standing relationship with optimum and its leadership team and are delighted to welcome them
7670960 we need to find out who this second suspect is to try to figure out what the story really is it all appears on its face that driscoll and another suspect were breaking into this boat we dont know why
7670961 we knew who he was he had no need for money or anything so it wasnt just breaking in there was more to it

7670966 older australians in aged care deserve good care and any home failing will be dealt with
7670967 the welfare of the residents was the governments primary concern and that is why the aged care standards and accreditation agency and department of health and ageing are monitoring the facility

7670971 most of my clients have those black american express cards the ones made out of titanium
7670972 they dont worry about their mortgages they dont worry about recession they just want to buy
7670973 its obvious that the mccain campaign and the rnc have decided to go after barack obama as a flip flopper whats equally obvious though that republicans couldnt have chosen a worse narrative
7670974 the irony of course is that the mccain campaign couldnt have picked a more hypocritical line of attack below youll find a comprehensive list of reversals from the republican nominee numbered and organized by category for easier reference
7670975 i should note that theres nothing offensive about a political figure changing his or her mind once in a while
7670976 i dont think it is a coincidence that with tomorrow being ten weeks from election day senator coleman now suddenly cares about energy policy and energy independence
7670977 but instead of moving our country towards energy independence norm coleman was too busy raking in nearly 250 000 in campaign contributions from big oil more than any other politician in minnesota history all while supporting the bush cheney energy plan
7670978 make no mistake we find ourselves in the midst of an energy crisis because politicians like norm coleman care more about the profits of big oil that line his campaign coffers than becoming truly energy independent
7670979 if you look at the 2005 energy bill that dick cheney and george bush helped promote president bush and vice president cheney barack obama voted against it because it in his view gave away too many additional tax breaks to oil companies and traditional energy and didnt emphasize renewable and clean energy enough
7670980 senate finance chairman charles e grassley r iowa said the tax breaks were expanded to satisfy demands from congressional backers of the oil and gas industry he said the final version of the bill includes 11 9 billion in tax breaks for the industry
7670981 citizens should remember the energy bill fiasco say when filling the tank in the family van
7670982 the federal energy bill a greased pig waddling to the finish line stinks it is too much to hope that it wont pass at least the senate should retain its good sense and say no to drilling in anwr and ordinary citizens should remember the energy bill fiasco say when filling the tank in the family van or paying the heating bills
7670983 the projections in the ocs access case indicate that access to the pacific
7670984 would not be enough to make a significant dent in the price of gas
7670985 while there are strong arguments that can be made in favor of offshore drilling reducing the cost of gas here and now isnt one of them according to oil experts and economists many of whom support the plan for starters the lead time for oil exploration takes years even if offshore drilling areas opened up tomorrow experts say it would take at least 10 years to realize any significant production and even then they say the contribution to the overall global oil market would not be enough to make a significant dent in the price of gas
7670986 even if congress does lift the ban on drilling on the continental shelf and states go along energy experts say its at least a five to seven year process before new drilling could begin and that could be optimistic
7670987 it will not be in the term of the next president that we will see much significant increase in production even if we were to change the moratorium say on jan 20 2009
7670988 the truth about americas energy big oil stockpiles supplies and pockets profits
7670989 the 68 million acres of leased but currently inactive federal land and waters could produce an additional 4 8 million barrels of oil and 44 7 billion cubic feet of natural gas each day
7670990 that would nearly double total oil production and increase natural gas production by 75 it would also cut oil imports by more than a third and be more than six times the estimated peak production from the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr
7670991 senate passes deficit reduction act of 2005 renewable energy programs cut
7670992 i have no idea tomorrows like the first day at preschool for me i am just happy to be on the panel and ill sit wherever they put me
7670993 anything to do with the show in terms of the format and the sitting and all those things i really am not privy to
7670994 i just know that im on the judging panel and that im supposed to have my makeup done by 11 a m tomorrow thats pretty much all i know beyond that i leave it to the brains behind the show to answer those questions
7670995 of course but its really flattering too to think that theyd even thought about me
7670996 when i got the call i thought they were calling the wrong person so im the new kid on the block and im hoping everyones going to go easy on me and that i bring a lot to the table
7670997 i think my insight might be different just because i have different opinions and my approach will be different id say im going to be a straight shooter and say it like i see it and just maintain that philosophy and also try to help the contestants
7670998 im just somebody whos really honest and gives my opinion and if i feel i need to be hard with someone in order to get that across i will be and if i feel i need to be softer or more nurturing with some of the contestants ill be that it really depends on the situation
7670999 anybody with the right brain would say something like that shes on a big big show and shes just probably pondering what could happen like anybody would
7671000 i think that people are on the show as part of their journey whether theyre going to be huge artists or not theyre there to learn something and no matter what the experience is going to help them learn so criticism can also be constructive im not going to be on the show to just nail people im also going to be on there to also help them
7671001 for me im really looking for someone who is unique who has a great style an incredible stage presence and a great voice im looking for the next big thing thats what im looking for
7671002 i thought i was evil stupid unfit i thought everyone i knew at work thought so too
7671003 october 2007 i was seriously depressed i had screwed up at work my first professional position in a profession i thought i was born for i had screwed up and i still had to do my job what would i do if it didnt work out for me little by little i began to recover from my error still i was plagued by doubt and despair then as winter began to approach i compared my current mood with my feelings the previous year i had been hopeful then i was almost finished with my graduate degree and knew that a position was opening that i was planning on applying for at the staff christmas party there was nothing but joy and hope and for me a buzzy sense of rightness and anticipation well i applied got the promotion and screwed it right up i thought i was evil stupid unfit i thought everyone i knew at work thought so too but as i began to climb out of the pit of despair it dawned on me that i needed to do something to act grad school had been full of goals my current job could have them but i was stuck in just hanging on i was letting the day to day work rule me and grind me down i needed to do something desperate november was coming i had always wanted to do nanowrimo i felt this time i would try to accomplish this simple goal that would affect no one but myself i would try to write a novel 50 000 words knowing they didnt have to be excellent words in 30 days i did and it restored my confidence in my abilities to accomplish something even if it was anything i cant begin to tell you even if i had 50 million words and unlimited time how much better i felt for accomplishing the writing of my little novel im happier at my job now because of something i did totally unrelated to it ill do it again in a heartbeat 30 days worth of heartbeats
7671004 at the very heart of my motivation for supporting barack is my girls and the kind of world that i want to hand over to them and the kind of people i want to lead the world
7671005 i think joe briden brings a lot to the ticket were excited ive helped joe biden a lot hillary clinton best friends with joe biden i think its a great pick it helps us with the national security issues he was born in scranton obviously the delaware market goes into the pennsylvania media market in philadelphia so politically it helps us in pennsylvania but theres nobody better
7671006 david twowy right now is writing the scripts the only question is whether we take a page from the lord of the rings guys and try to shoot the two chapters at the same time there are two more in mind
7671007 the chronicles of riddick was presented as a three part trilogy that would answer pitch black in the same way that lord of the rings answered the hobbit
7671008 this is a targeted enforcement operation that is part of an ongoing ice investigation that has revealed that illegal aliens are employed at howard industries
7671009 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7671010 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7671011 neither one of them can win but both of them can make the other lose
7671012 i just dont see how theres going to be any stand down by either one of them thats going to turn the campaign in another direction
7671013 when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember
7671014 now hes a convicted felon facing jail thats a housing problem
7671015 were not going to shy away from making the contrast people are making a choice we need to make clear what that choice is
7671016 were going to do it in a constructive way but were going to lay it out very very clearly
7671017 and if i dont play ill be ready for kansas city
7671018 yeah i sure do ive been playing a lot of football so whether you play or dont play in the preseason id be ready no matter what its up to coach i was hoping i could play last week
7671019 i was wishing i could play last week and it didnt happen and itll be the same thing this week im hoping im out there and if im not im not im trying to get better as fast as i can in the ways i know how its been making improvement theres no doubt about it
7671020 we will not rest until all of the prisoners are freed there will not be peace without the release of all the prisoners
7671021 it can also be inferred that kevin fischer has a distaste for pro life wisconsin types on yesterdays show he referred to people who objected to abortion for rape and incest victims as
7671022 and if being pro life means that kevin calls me a
7671023 we hope that arab countries made efforts to extinguish their debts overdue iraq because it can not be held accountable for the mistakes of the iraqi people the previous regime and should follow the example of kuwait and other emirates in extinguishing debt
7671024 let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless in facing them let me not beg for the stilling of my pain but for the heart to conquer it
7671025 concentrate put all your eggs in one basket and watch that basket
7671026 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7671027 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7671028 im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
7671029 people know that i can give the kind of speech that i gave four years ago thats not the question on voters mind i think theyre much more interested in what am i going to do to help them in their lives
7671030 and so in that sense this is going to be a more workman like speech
7671031 it never crossed the smallest part of my mind that i could go to harvard law school
7671032 ase were men who had been sentenced amp found guilty by a supreme court walking around freely
7671033 a comm amp ers a war criminals still have armed groups
7671034 ayre in a government karzai a americans a british sit down with am ay have impunity ayve become very courageous amp can do whatever crimes ay like

7671038 meeting of the vulcan mind meld with turoczy thanks so much for your input the chicken piri piri sandwich at clyde common was good too
7671039 i could take this rainy overcast weather for a few more days nice and cool for a change
7671040 i have been working on my off ice training this summer
7671041 i was a little rusty because i havent been on the ice in a while but by the end of the camp i was feeling good and my cardio was strong
7671042 from looking at where he was last year in august to this year in this camp it was a marked improvement
7671043 in the second scrimmage he was the most physical defenseman on the ice
7671044 i have never had training like i did at api
7671045 they taught me how to focus off the ice and prepare for the game along with how to eat right
7671046 since not getting drafted last year i am trying to prove to people i belong here
7671047 i thought colin was certainly one of the most skilled forwards there
7671048 i was encouraged he really did well for his first experience in the usa camp he needs to build on last season he is so smart with the puck i can see how points come his way we need to find a way to get him stronger
7671049 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7671050 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7671051 would come up from the mines after 12 hours and play football
7671052 who told all the jews to stay home that day
7671053 worf could hang onto it with one hand and swing it pretty hard
7671054 personally i am very angry its just not right its something you never expect
7671055 being a police officer i was always worried and afraid of him being lost in the line of duty and for him to have someone take his life that needlessly hurts all of us
7671056 i know everybody will remember john as he was because he never met a stranger he always wanted to be a friend to help when he could and i will miss him more than anybody i think
7671057 he was very likeable everybody loved john and john loved everybody i just love and ill always be in our thoughts and prayers forever
7671058 biofuels are a real solution to a real problem to retreat from biofuels is wrong

7671060 i would estimate that the damage in the moorhouse ave lincoln rd area in the past few weeks would be in excess of 50 000 woodbury said
7671061 these offences are serious and are of great concern to local business owners
7671062 aj muy bien hicieron lo que ten an que hacer ganar

7671064 if the democratic party was going to honestly acknowledge how it came to the point in its history that it was about to nominate a black american for president no speech would not mention lyndon johnson
7671065 i am writing right now about how he won for black americans the right to vote i am turning from what happened forty three years ago to what i am reading in my daily newspaper and the thrill that goes up and down my spine when i realize the historical significance of this moment is only equaled by my anger that they are not giving johnson credit for it
7671066 for me as a christian it is a sacred union god is in the mix
7671067 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce unwanted pregnancies
7671068 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
7671069 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
7671070 as a nation we are all better off for having had a forum like this
7671071 its a great service to the public square i think to see the candidates reaction to questions that many people want to have asked and are interested in hearing but so many of the media and political gatekeepers arent interested in communicating
7671072 i think this group has a little chip on their shoulder
7671073 we have approached that in a constructive way rather than a divisive thing there will be plenty off blame to go around what we have to find out is who will dig deep when it gets tough
7671074 these guys are taking heat every single day every single practice where someone has something to say negatively about them
7671075 honestly if anyone pays attention and actually watches practice they can see that theyre doing just fine
7671076 probably one of the best defenses we will face all year probably one of the best defenses ive faced in my career
7671077 theyve got some good corners and safeties who arent scared to come up and hit
7671078 its not overly complicated guys look open but they are not for very long you feel you can run reverses all of a sudden a defender peels off and instead of a huge gain you get two or three yards and are left wondering why you spent time on that play
7671079 my mom and i spent 8 5 months planning the wedding for my husband and i and i have to say that i cant think of one thing that i would change its so hard to try and visualize how you think your wedding day will turn out but i cant complain about anything
7671080 would come up from the mines after 12 hours and play football
7671081 who told all the jews to stay home that day
7671082 this is the first time studio pierrot has created an original opening sequence featuring naruto for the u s video game audience
7671083 the movie is a great introduction to our exclusive storyline that expands upon the anbu a special covert operation group from the hidden leaf village and their role within the naruto world
7671084 fight the stereotype that they are all old and dour
7671085 miss sister 2008 contest will start in september on a blog run by the rev
7671086 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7671087 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7671088 io vorrei di quegli abbracci che sanno di braccia attorno
7671089 io ti ho amato andr e non saprei neanche immaginare come si possa amare di pi
7671090 i hate london i hate england im glad we had a revolution

7671092 io vorrei di quegli abbracci che sanno di braccia attorno
7671093 io ti ho amato andr e non saprei neanche immaginare come si possa amare di pi
7671094 overall from day one to now i think weve seen progress and were better equipped
7671095 im a lot more optimistic when we get into the attacking third were not running out of ideas we have a distinct way of playing were going to get opportunities now its just tightening up our midfield
7671096 im sure when we sit down as a coaching staff and watch the body of work over this entire preseason i think well be relatively happy with it
7671097 theres definitely a set lineup that could vary two or three players right now
7671098 right now with all of our injuries we may only be 13 or 14 deep the hope is the guys that are injured get healthy and you hope in the meantime a few guys step it up a bit how long it takes them to do it well have to see
7671099 we need the kind of supporter that through rain or shine thick and thin win loss or tie theyre going to be there
7671100 porque los comandantes del alba hemos decidido donarle al gobierno de honduras 100 tractores con sus implementos agr colas
7671101 vamos a ver lo que es la revoluci n qu es la revoluci n qui n es pitiyanqui no queremos vivir en comunismo nosotros rechazamos ese comunismo estamos acostumbrados a vivir en democracia y libertad
7671102 si contra algo atenta esas leyes es contra el sector privado que es sin nimo de desarrollo y estas son leyes que le dan una discreci n total al ejecutivo nacional y sobre todo que van en contra de la libertad econ mica libre iniciativa y de la libre empresa
7671103 a recent study conducted out of the university of wisconsin madison found that out of 1 015 adult americans polled only 29 5 agreed that nanotechnology was morally acceptable in stark contrast 54 1 of brits 62 7 of germans and 72 1 of french survey participants found the technology acceptable
7671104 rather than just measure the test score of a particular day the value added measures the movement of the student in the time the teacher has with him
7671105 they need to have a certain percent pass reading and math tests and if they dont reach that percentage you are not considered meeting ayp so the growth model helped us to meet ayp by showing these students made growth
7671106 the 4x100 metre relay holds a special place in my heart so to gear up with the team was very exciting once we saw our lane draw for the semifinal lane two against the jamaicans and brits everyone initially gulped but after some reflection and study of our previous races both individually and as a team we knew that we were capable of making the final waiting for the first semifinal to finish was nerve wracking to say the least not to mention having to watch four of the eight teams either be disqualified or drop the baton either way we knew that regardless of what happened in that section we had a plan and a goal and a little rain bad karma and 91 000 fans screaming in your ear wouldnt get in the way of accomplishing those goals once our first runner was called to the blocks was when i began to actually feel butterflies in my stomach truthfully for the first time since being at the olympics i felt no nervousness before the 200 metres runs the gun fired and the race was off after that everything is a blur once i handed it off to pierre our anchor leg i knew we were in the final and a tremendous wave of relief passed over me and a strong sense of belonging really set in after the race we went through the normal media mix zone where the press asked us all what our chances would be in the final and essentially we all answered the same way a medal
7671107 we saw the lane draw early that morning and instantly were excited lane six outside trinidad and jamaica and inside japan a perfect opportunity to get in the mix for a medal
7671108 guten morgen le puedo ayudar with something sil vous pla t
7671109 it would be like alcohol regulation but without the gross commercial aspects
7671110 cannabis law reform is the lynch pin issue in nz
7671111 there would be no chance for mr heim to take control of his fathers money as long as there is no hint or proof for mr heims demise there is no legal basis for german authorities to declare him dead
7671112 i do not see any way the kids can inherit the bank account of their father
7671113 as long as we dont know he is dead we have to assume hes still alive
7671114 we are staying tuned to his case as we are talking about very cruel crimes
7671115 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7671116 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying
7671117 i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here instead of taking the motorway we took the road up through the brecon beacons i feel at home here
7671118 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
7671119 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show
7671120 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7671121 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the screen would be amazing
7671122 it would take dr who to the next level so should be very successful
7671123 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too
7671124 we cant make torchwood toys we cant market to children because its an adult show maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it
7671125 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7671126 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7671127 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7671128 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7671129 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7671130 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up
7671131 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7671132 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7671133 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7671134 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7671135 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster
7671136 what is satisfying is the fact that adult fiction gets a lot more attention in the media and whether were conscious of it or not childrens fiction gets dismissed as less important and less sophisticated and it requires less talent
7671137 i am a person who just doesnt see the division so clearly
7671138 for anyone who has seen or heard the new wendys comercial the person who came up with the term
7671139 land rovers are present in small numbers in mumbai currently our colleagues at jlr jaguar land rover have chalked out plans for expansion in the country within a one year timeframe which will be followed by the entry of jaguar
7671140 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 20 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
7671141 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7671142 those basic principles have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
7671143 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs
7671144 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
7671145 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
7671146 we have every expectation that the president will move forward on protecting these places sometime in the fall
7671147 today we put the champagne on ice and we will pop it open
7671148 these vast pacific areas are nearly three times the size of texas
7671149 countless seabirds dolphins fishes corals and tiny things as yet undiscovered could survive as a result free of the threats that are eliminating them elsewhere
7671150 now then young sir you must be too old to be expecting a tip eh
7671151 you must be too old to be expecting tips from people thats for the young uns
7671152 it is indeed and i only tip youngsters who need a little extra pocket money old pros like you dont need any extra
7671153 blogging has allowed us as bahrainis to breathe some fresh air as a blogger you feel that you are helping your country
7671154 i wanted to create a website where people inside and outside bahrain could communicate and exchange information
7671155 people are seeing the mistakes of the government and they want to freely discuss them
7671156 blogs are very effective because the society is highly politicized and a lot of people are internet users

7671161 did we find it absolutely not we did not find that listeria
7671162 did we let people down yes but we were doing the right things
7671163 were inspected regularly by the canadian food inspection agency all of our plants are federally registered the highest level of food safety in canada and they have full time inspectors on site
7671164 i am constantly troubled by the lack of surveillance information on food borne and water borne illnesses in canada
7671165 theyre very straightforward they are highly blunt they say exactly what theyre thinking in terms of their public image versus the reality at home i dont think there is that much of a divide
7671166 as a girl ivanka spent much of her time in a lilac painted room on the top floor of the trump tower at fifth avenue and 56th street
7671167 the way my father praises me is that he increasingly gives me more to do says ivanka
7671168 they just made me a floor whip and sent me to give the florida delegation their seats
7671169 ask yourself whether your message can be processed effectively within three seconds
7671170 my friends tell me that i have a tendency to point out problems without offering solutions but they never tell me what i should do about it
7671171 what about the rights of victims and law abiding citizens

7671176 within our testing phase we already saved more than 15 000 square yards of rainforest
7671177 this is the only person the only democrat that has been re elected since fdr and he is somebody who is equally adept at talking about domestic issues and foreign policy issues
7671178 wednesday night most of the focus is going to be about foreign policy but bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank an economy out of the doldrums and trying to help middle class families
7671179 it wouldnt make much sense for me to want to edit his remarks to prevent him from making a strong case about why we need fundamental economic change in this country
7671180 one of the things i dont want to do is start getting into all the details about my vice presidential process
7671181 ive said publicly and i will repeat again that senator clinton would have been on anybodys short list and so i took her very seriously
7671182 be active parts of our campaign for the remaining 70 days
7671183 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7671184 small minds talk about people mediocre minds talk about events great minds talk about ideas
7671185 one of the themes is about the responsibilities you face when being away from home reflected by sam witwicky played by shia labeouf going to college and by the fact that the transformers themselves are of course far from cybertron
7671186 and its true hes chairman of the senate foreign relations committee he knows world leaders he can be a wonderful counselor and adviser people talk about all the experience he has in washington and thats true hes been chairman of the judiciary committee he helped pass the violence against women act he helped pass the 1994 crime bill that put 100 000 more cops on the streets he knows how to get things done in washington
7671187 but you know the most important thing about joe biden
7671188 hes never forgotten where he came from hes from a working class family that he still takes the train back every night to delaware to spend it with his family
7671189 gone through the tragedy of losing his first wife and his infant daughter in a car accident
7671190 this is planetary destabilization and its already begun the question is how do we arrest this before it gets to the point of catastrophe
7671191 the earth could be free of arctic summer ice within our lifetime
7671192 this has not happened as far as we know in 130 000 years as long as human beings have existed on the planet
7671193 if you had a gauge in your car reading in the red zone how long would you feel comfortable driving down the highway like that thats where we are now
7671194 he said you dont understand were going to ban the sale of new automobiles in this country
7671195 if we were to move to the most efficient lighting technologies available today we could reduce electricity demand nationwide by 12 percent
7671196 on coal fired energy kutscher says energy efficiency alone can reduce u s energy use by 57 percent and beyond efficiency carbon emissions can be drastically reduced by generating vastly more energy from cleaner sources like the wind sun and earths heat we see 40 percent of the worlds electricity coming from wind
7671197 that would require building roughly a million and a half over the next dozen years now a million and a half may sound like a lot but we make 65 million cars a year
7671198 i mention that just to give a sense of how much renewable energy there is out there three states in the u s texas have enough energy capacity to power the whole country
7671199 from being a nation of energy consumers to being a nation of energy producers
7671200 wouldnt it be nice if you put solar panels on your house you got a check in the mail farmers in germany now have a new revenue stream
7671201 we have the solutions we just need to come up with the political will to get those technologies out there even faster
7671202 we believe in using nonviolent civil disobedience at times when its necessary to incite change it takes me to jail sometimes
7671203 as i look around the room i see some of the people ive been to jail with here today
7671204 we cant have half measures we dont have time to lose we have to hit the ground running
7671205 now is the time to speak the truth and bring new people into the political process well only do this from the bottom up if people way beyond
7671206 are we going to have the biggest political failure in the history of the world
7671207 are we going to create a human wave that knocks down the doors of congress and knocks down the doors of the
7671208 i really dont want to say what the situation is
7671209 there is some situation some things that are going on
7671210 we are very excited about having three players represent oklahoma state in the world amateur
7671211 the girls have all worked very hard for this and i am extremely proud of each of them i know from my own experiences that it is something they will never forget

7671224 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7671225 driving down burnley road past the quarry and where the townley arms used to be located you get a great view of burnley my son noticed them first about 15 to 20 lights in the sky just above the town i stopped the car and got out for a better look
7671226 they were single lights glowing and were moving slowly upwards towards the clouds some appeared to be moving in formation and one rose up from the ground and joined the others they seemed to circle for a few minutes then rose up slowly through the clouds and out of sight
7671227 the whole experience lasted about five minutes at the most from spotting them to the last light disappearing
7671228 the lights seemed to be quite large but its difficult to say really the only explanation i could give would be someone setting helium balloons off with lights inside although that sounds a bit ridiculous itself
7671229 whatever they were i havent seen anything like them and my son and i got a birds eye view right over the town where they were i am usually a bit sceptical about these things but i cant explain what i saw adequately
7671230 they appeared in the sky over the rooftop facing our house moving slowly but purposely in a south westerly to north easterly direction there seemed to be 12 or more bright white lights in formation with a few stragglers
7671231 we often see the lights of aircraft flying over at night but there were far too many of these lights close together to be aircraft planes usually have flashing lights and these lights didnt flash
7671232 my wife and i went outside to watch and i tried to get a closer look with my binoculars but couldnt see them any clearer we watched for a couple of minutes until they went out of sight behind clouds
7671233 it was a very unusual sight and unlike anything ive ever seen before
7671234 the bridge is a symbol of a much larger issue it symbolizes the need for renewal
7671235 ive never had someone make this kind of claim the facts are clear the congress street bridge has never been a priority of the city in the end its the citys decision
7671236 didnt make it federal priority they made it a state priority
7671237 i believe that the other two should be a priority and its not that the bridge is not important
7671238 if we dont have a good intermodal system then steel point will be a waste
7671239 he actually has had conversations with congressman shays bill definitely brought it up to him
7671240 it would probably be easier to take the bridge down
7671241 we met with shays personally he stated that it was a waste of money
7671242 tu ne te feras pas dimage taill e ni aucune figure de ce qui est en haut dans le ciel ou de ce qui est en bas sur la terre ou de ce qui est dans les eaux au dessous de la terre

7671245 a gestural musical controller designed and built by joseph malloch the t stick can sense where and how much of it is touched tapping twisting tilting squeezing and shaking
7671246 i recommend playing all the videos at once personally the sound is
7671247 when the numbers were high i would get stopped in the street maybe once a week
7671248 now that the viewing figures are lower on the tv everywhere i go someone will come up to me and say what a huge fan they are that just tells me that people watch the show in a more modern way and that it has reached its sort of critical mass
7671249 tivo had just sort of taken off this was four or five seasons ago and because we were on friday nights most people most fans dont watch it on first run they tivo it and watch it a zillion times
7671250 in fact i dont think we ever go into space
7671251 its really about big business the machinations and the subterfuge that go on inside of it when you have something that is groundbreaking and could change the nature of life and the future
7671252 im just gonna speak to simon the way i speak to everybody
7671253 im just gonna have my opinion be honest and i dont foresee any problems im really excited about this and up for the challenge
7671254 its really flattering too you know to think that idol even thought about me
7671255 i mean when i got the call i thought they were calling the wrong person so im the new kid on the block and im hoping everyones gonna go easy on me and that i bring a lot to the table
7671256 im maybe not a household name but people know of me in the industry
7671257 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7671258 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7671259 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7671260 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7671261 id say i believe in what i believe in and im willing to fight for it and im pretty feisty
7671262 that when their song comes on the radio i know exactly who it is its not about vocal acrobatics
7671263 thats one of the big reasons why i was an early supporter of senator obama
7671264 it looks new its stacked nicely very clean it doesnt look like scrap material
7671265 the overall quality of customer experience is largely defined by personalized online interactions companies that consistently deliver these positive customer experiences across all touch points maintain consumer loyalty build stronger brands and are better able to avoid competition on price alone therefore they grow faster and earn healthier profits than companies that dont consider consumer experience a priority
7671266 with more access to information more sensitivity to price and less sensitivity to advertising customers are getting harder to win and keep organizations try to woo these empowered consumers with mediocre experiences but it wont work firms need to dramatically raise the bar on the customer experience they provide
7671267 the online gaming market by its very nature requires us to be much more highly engaged with our online customers than is needed for the typical offline game customer rightnow enables us to cost efficiently deliver the premium quality customer experience that differentiates our brand

7671269 oh no we respect the fan if you wear your gear you will be respected
7671270 they are an obvious attempt to smear the senators character
7671271 shame on all of us for not helping with the project
7671272 after all he has done for us every man woman and child should have chipped in to build our greatest alaskan ever a home the size of the white house
7671273 most importantly however disclosure of the things of value and the negative repercussions flowing from that disclosure would have threatened the defendants future stream of things of value from veco bill allen and others
7671274 i am concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see
7671275 after working in the clinton administration in the department of commerce on internet privacy and online commerce issues hunter consulted for five years as an expert on these very same issues at a time of enormous expansion in online banking
7671276 he was not a lobbyist for mbna and his work had absolutely nothing to do with the bankruptcy bill zero nothing
7671277 took plenty of knocks from the largest employer in his state because he demanded changes
7671278 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill

7671298 el reto es sobrevivir al gobierno que desprecia a los m dicos
7671299 han pasado cuatro meses desde que el pa s esta siendo encabezado por un gobierno renunciado el cual carece de legitimidad para abordar los problemas
7671300 pusimos en marcha una serie de protestas en abril porque el precio del arroz y de otros productos alimenticios estaban muy altos pero desde entonces los precios se han duplicado
7671301 y el presidente ren preval y los pol ticos en el parlamento no est n haciendo nada para solucionar los problemas
7671302 el reto es sobrevivir al gobierno que desprecia a los m dicos
7671303 there is blood everywhere in the unit we have told the police it was you how do you feel about that
7671304 the club does not want to prejudge greg until we have had an opportunity to meet with him and his legal counsel face to face
7671305 however we are mindful that the allegations made by police prosecution at this point in time are extremely serious
7671306 the accused person is actively trying to deceive police by inferring other people are involved in the matter and not being entirely honest
7671307 this places considerable doubt on the version of mr bird
7671308 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7671309 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7671310 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7671311 the most visible element is obviously venue construction and the progress made on the olympic park in particular is truly astounding in all the areas of preparation we have been able to see marked progress by the london 2012 team and this puts locog on track to deliver great games in 2012 and a great legacy beyond
7671312 he looked around that big stadium and stopped dead in his tracks i could feel his heart beating against my legs
7671313 i dont think that this is bad news at all actually the fact weve got 350 000 more jobs than we had when we were elected 1999 to lead the government should be very good news for new zealand
7671314 it can also be inferred that kevin fischer has a distaste for pro life wisconsin types on yesterdays show he referred to people who objected to abortion for rape and incest victims as
7671315 and if being pro life means that kevin calls me a

7671320 the police a jetblue rep and a tsa official all looked at the video and agreed that it was too dark to really see who was on it and that it clearly had been shot from my seat so i had not interfered with anything that was going on
7671321 he informed me that if i didnt immediately delete it i could never fly on jetblue again
7671322 he said that he would be filing a report that would be shared with other airlines and i might have a hard time getting any airline to let me fly
7671323 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
7671324 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7671325 i can also say that if theres any way we can reward the community well go there
7671326 i thought everything from communication between your group and attendees to the diversity of professional presentations was outstanding

7671349 it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for the indian courts decision
7671350 mattels action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary
7671351 its beyond censorship it is killing the biggest ecosystem of free expression and freedom of speech that has ever existed
7671352 we had inside sources from bigger companies who gave us the information on how exclusivity deals are being made at this moment between isps and big content providers like tv production studios and major video game publishers to decide which web sites will be in the standard package offered to their customers leaving all the rest of the internet unreachable unless you pay extra subscription fees per every non standard site you visit
7671353 we knew the source to be 100 reliable but we also knew the story would be highly controversial if we released the information we did it because we knew that wed get more official confirmations once wed come forward with it and indeed that is what happened dylan pattyn who is writing the soon to be published article for time magazine received confirmation from sources within bell canada and telus after we released the information
7671354 the internet will become a playground for billion dollar content providers just like television is
7671355 it wont be possible for a few teenagers in their parents basement to start a small site like e bay that then grows out to be the next big thing anymore right now the internet belongs to those with the greatest ideas in the future itll belong to those with the biggest budgets
7671356 by 2012 isps all over the globe will reduce internet access to a tv like subscription model only offering access to a small standard amount of commercial sites and require extra fees for every other site you visit these other sites would then lose all their exposure and eventually shut down resulting in what could be seen as the end of the internet
7671357 this new subscription model is commercially far more beneficial to them than how it is now
7671358 if fox wants to launch a new television show online theyll have to pay big money to all major isps to ensure that their new show will be offered and pushed in the standard package of sites services channels that people will get through their internet access plus isps will also gain extra revenue out of people trying to access the rest of the internet as theyll pay extra subscription fees for every web site they visit
7671359 marketing and big budget content pushing just doesnt seem to work on the internet and this is something that several industries want fixed isps know this and will benefit greatly by fixing this for the marketing and entertainment industry

7671374 i think the box office effect has been the major issue at this years festival i think it has caused a great deal of upset with the public and it has impacted on a proportion of the audience who will have been put off

7671418 aq is not the only extremist ideology of interest or concern domestically or overseas but countering the aq threat is a counterterrorism priority and requires aq centric communications efforts
7671419 it the narrative combines fact fiction emotion and religion and manipulates discontent about local and international issues the narrative is simple flexible and infinitely accommodating it can be adapted to suit local conditions and may have a disproportionate influence on understanding and interpretation of local or global events
7671420 the objective is not to dismiss grievances but undermine aqs position as their champion and violent extremism as the solution
7671421 our first tailored product with key arguments exposing the theme aq is losing support
7671422 this series of guidance alone will not fatally undermine the aq narrative but it can increase our impact against the narrative while we develop a bespoke and hard hitting campaign using private sector resources

7671431 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7671432 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7671433 cre a que ganar a unos 60 mil d lares anuales en un trabajo cualificado
7671434 para saber lo que se gana en uno y en otro
7671435 todo tiene que ver con la demanda si hay escasez de trabajadores en un rea el empleador va a ofrecer salarios m s altos que en aquellos puestos para los que hay m s solicitantes
7671436 graduados de un colegio o universidad reconocida con una licenciatura que incluya al menos 12 unidades en administraci n computaci n contabilidad finanzas econom a y estad sticas
7671437 cuando hay muchas personas tituladas para un tipo de trabajo que es muy general entonces el sueldo va a ser menor
7671438 pongamos el ejemplo de que hay muchos egresados en derecho pero no hay demanda de abogados entonces estos ganar n menos que alguien que instale paneles solares o sistemas de aire acondicionado porque falta quien llene esos puestos aunque s lo hayan conseguido un certificado especializado
7671439 no menos de 500 600 d lares por semana en un taller o m s si trabaja para un concesionario o es un t cnico de revisi n de da os
7671440 para inscribirse a las clases no hace falta ser residente legal ni haber terminado la secundaria
7671441 a los que manejan los camiones de basura les pagan 27 d lares la hora y no han terminado la secundaria
7671442 muchos me preguntan si est s preparado qu haces aqu y te sientes m s est pido todav a
7671443 bien pagado sin tener estudios es cuesti n de suerte
7671444 en estados unidos el puesto m s pesado es siempre el mejor pagado y en todo eso se incluye la plomer a construcci n ingenier a
7671445 a la hora de crear un puesto nuevo la comisi n de personal somete las recomendaciones de cu l deber a ser el pago para trabajos ya existentes se hace una investigaci n sobre lo que se est pagando en el mercado tanto p blico como privado aunque muchas veces tienen que ser negociados con los sindicatos
7671446 sabemos que si pagamos menos no vamos a reclutar a candidatos y este es el caso concreto de los polic as aunque s lo se necesite tener un diploma de secundaria
7671447 necesitamos m s agentes de polic a en el distrito pero es dif cil reclutarlos porque la gente ve que en el lapd o el sheriff ganan m s dinero porque tienen m s presupuesto
7671448 le habr servido como una buena base personal adem s de la profesional
7671449 need to improve on the feeling of sluggishness of the gcd
7671450 while the net code for combat is currently very responsive the visual feedback for the player is somewhat out of sync even though both the client and server are quick to register and process your actions players still feel that the combat is sluggish due to the slower on screen feedback
7671451 we also need to figure out where were going to get salt and how much it will cost
7671452 im going to ask the attorney general to look into this because i believe its a blatant attempt at price fixing
7671453 there are a lot of questions i have as a public official as to how the state handled this
7671454 the pipeline was empty in march of last year all year the mines have been running flat out
7671455 i cant tell you if theres going to be enough for everybody to have what theyve bid
7671456 i have never pretended to political correctness so i can happily abhor the sanctimonious politically correct bullshit that made the british contribution to the olympic closing ceremony so appalling
7671457 hes from a working class family that he still takes the train back every night to delaware to spend it with his family
7671458 joe biden understands what youre going through because hes gone through it
7671459 it was only six years ago when michelle and i were still living in a small overcrowded condo without a garage so we had to scrape the ice off the car windows and were still in debt for our student loans and hadnt really figured out how we were gonna pay for our two daughters college educations
7671460 thats how we grew up we went to school on scholarships
7671461 most people dont really think john mccains gonna shake things up the real argument the republicans are making is obama is risky
7671462 what im going to work my heart out to do over the next 70 days is to say to people the biggest risk is just doing the same old things and thinking somehow were going to get a different result thinking were going to get this country back on track
7671463 if their stock tanks thats not my problem they were making money on the up side they should take a hit on the down side
7671464 ceos i have no sympathy for them so i dont want them still taking out bonuses the heads of these two companies took out 30 million in salaries and bonuses last year at a time when theyre losing money and theyre expecting taxpayers to bail them out thats unacceptable
7671465 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7671466 como un hito que ayuda a guardar la memoria de los hechos m s dolorosos de nuestro pa s
7671467 esa informaci n no es exacta pues al final del contrato el equipo pasa a ser del cliente lo que ocurre es que debido al lanzamiento se produjo cierta confusi n en nuestros puntos de venta lo que nos ha generado peque os inconvenientes
7671468 si un cliente desea adquirir el modelo de ocho gigabytes que cuesta 60 mil pesos la activaci n debe pagar 322 mil al momento de la compra esa cifra resulta de restar el costo de la activaci n a 382 mil pesos un monto estipulado por nosotros
7671469 el cliente paga unos 19 500 pesos al mes al final el monto equivale a lo que pagan los clientes del modelo est ndar
7671470 tenemos nuestros centros de ventas llenos lo que nos tiene bastante contentos al final de esta semana vamos a hacer un balance
7671471 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7671472 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
7671473 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7671474 let the market work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
7671475 if you talk to warren hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
7671476 that way your not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
7671477 i do think that what the argument may miss is the sense of control that we want individuals to have in determining their own career paths making their own life choices and so forth and i also think you want to instill that sense of self reliance and that what you do will help determine outcomes
7671478 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7671479 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
7671480 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
7671481 our broadband package promotes the best fit between the best available technology and the needs of users in the region concerned
7671482 the broadband fund will maximise competition assist investor certainty and give the best possible leverage for the taxpayers dollar
7671483 el equipo se est preparando bastante fuerte para el duelo ante brasil
7671484 what a blessing it is when the night has been too long to know that at last its morning
7671485 my attitude is that if you have relations with mr bashir sudanese president omar hassan al bashir in darfur
7671486 still the end result has been the loss of many japanese speaking opportunities potential japanese friends and communication in japanese i am reminded that
7671487 the joke involves current chinese president and mao he showed me story on his phone and tried to forward it to my phone strange thing happened
7671488 then came yesterdays closing ceremony and britains eight minute window of opportunity to invite the world to london 2012 as the breathless bbc commentators put it and guess what we blew it spectacularly
7671489 i like my democratic candidate so much that im willing to belittle the other democratic candidate from my own party
7671490 i swear by my life and by my love of it that i will never live for the sake of another man nor ask another man to live for mine
7671491 juro por mi vida y por mi amor por ella que nunca vivir para otro hombre ni pedir a otro hombre que viva para m

7671495 these people are considered dangerous and could possibly be armed so we are asking the public please do not approach them
7671496 drivers have always had some broad discretion so discretion is put the darn stuff underneath until we implement or change or improve on the policy
7671497 as far as not being allowed to carry on bags thats not something that greyhound has initiated
7671498 it should come as no surprise that a large majority of americans perceive senator obama as receiving more favorable media treatment compared to senator mccain obama is a fresh young and charismatic political figure any politician who is routinely compared to john f kennedy and bobby kennedy as obama has been will surely cultivate support among journalists this will change however once the nominating conventions are over and the general election campaign begins the euphoria will subside and we are likely to see more balanced coverage
7671499 when just 6 3 of those surveyed were unsure about the balance of media coverage for the candidates its a good indication it is obvious to americans but maybe not to the national media
7671500 more than two fifths 44 8 told our researchers that they would be very or somewhat likely to support a strong third party candidate if one emerged this has to be unsettling to both candidates
7671501 with respect to the poll concerning support for third parties it is not at all unusual to find a substantial portion of the electorate indicating displeasure with the nominees of the two major parties and a willingness to vote for a third party candidate this is a fairly typical finding
7671502 however when given the opportunity to actually vote for a third party candidate the vast majority of these disenchanted respondents will balk at the opportunity and cast their vote for either the democratic or republican candidate a good number of those persons polled who supported none of the above will also vote for one of the two major party candidates the united states has been a two party system since the beginning of the republic and this will not change any time soon
7671503 no entiendo c mo se re nen los secretarios jur dico y de prensa de palacio con un reconocido paramilitar antonio l pez alias job en donde todo el pa s sabe que pertenece a esa organizaci n al margen de la ley no s como el presidente lvaro uribe pide que se capturen a los miembros de la oficina de envigado y su jefe de jur dica est recibiendo a miembros de esa oficina para recepcionar pruebas en contra de los magistrados de la corte
7671504 ste es a mi juicio de lo m s grave ocurrido dentro de todas las manifestaciones que se han hecho contra la corte yo no entiendo c mo en la casa de nari o se recibe a un paramilitar para que entregue unas supuestas pruebas contra los magistrados de la corte suprema de justicia
7671505 i am thrilled that my work was recognized by the judges and to have two pieces selected is a real honor
7671506 it is exciting because it gives non members a chance to show their work in this gorgeous historic building
7671507 its the one time of year when we reach beyond our four walls and very small prestigious membership
7671508 whats more important your goal or others opinions of your goal
7671509 i think im well off but really im just swimming in loans up to my eyeballsl but as long as i dont think about it im happy
7671510 we are most pleased this is a landmark case in canadian history
7671511 the court has acknowledged that there are serious issues that need to be examined we maintain that the residents of long term care facilities have been subsidizing health care costs that are insured under the canada health act
7671512 in one instance a lady who has no shower in her room she has her clothes hanging near the toilet will be paying in november 1 683 38
7671513 these are frail people who suffer from chronic disabilities who can no longer care for themselves these are the seniors who built the wealth of this province
7671514 i think the first thing to remember is that this is not a decision on the lawsuit itself
7671515 it simply says that the lawsuit can proceed through the courts
7671516 so its essential that minister of public safety stockwell day persuade his u s counterpart the secretary of homeland security to shut down the illegal operations on the u s side of akwesasne
7671517 these are not licensed as required by u s federal law and theyre the prime source of cigarettes that are smuggled into canada and if the reverse was occurring and there was widespread contraband in the u s originating from canada the u s government would insist that the canadian government take action
7671518 were very concerned that the decline in smoking rates has now stopped
7671519 and the reason for that in our view is the widespread contraband problem that is providing access to inexpensive cigarettes and that is impeding governments from increasing tobacco taxes
7671520 policing has evolved over the last 15 years but not far enough
7671521 the next phase has to be the acceptance of people from other backgrounds
7671522 the police are moving but they need to move to the next step
7671523 the messages are interpreted as an emphasis of police getting tough on people of colour instead of tough on crime
7671524 people just dont feel they have an equal opportunity there and they dont want to be part of an institution that will crack down on their community
7671525 youth have a tendency to move away from the police police have to change their image and their approach
7671526 are the standards of entrance the standards that will promote diversity
7671527 we have increased the funding across the board when it comes to supporting police across the country
7671528 were always looking at what more needs to be done
7671529 i could see already that their presence is already recognized theyre having an effect
7671530 causing street gangs to be less aggressive and more restrained in their activities
7671531 thats a municipal and provincial responsibility and theyre handling it at that level
7671532 as the initial shock wore off five main responses to the google threat emerged from nations around the world negotiations with google banning google products developing a similar product taking evasive measures and nonchalance
7671533 blurred out 51 things you arent allowed to see on google maps
7671534 the biggest difference for me from last year to this year has been learning to save my strength maintaining consistency in each round and being careful not to push so hard that you get sloppy and crash
7671535 when i saw brian lopes go down early i knew it was open for everyone in the field this win is definitely among the best in my career and im happy to be going home with some good money
7671536 i didnt come here with the intention of winning but im really proud of myself for earning this title
7671537 im really sorry that melissa fell but im glad i had a chance to go up against her in the final we have all had our falls and thats the way it is sometimes she is my buddy and my first reaction was to stop but i reminded myself that there was 5 000 waiting for me at the bottom of the hill this is my biggest achievement to date and now i want to take this momentum to the world cup circuit and see what i can do
7671538 dion is essentially refusing to meet and not only refusing to meet refusing to speak by phone
7671539 this is a sign that hes for all intents and purposes broken off communication with the prime minister
7671540 sending canadians into a 400 million federal election wont be decided over the phone or a text message the issues facing canadians are too important
7671541 hes certainly not going to give harper a blank cheque
7671542 in the age of modern communication if somebodys saying they cant find a way to talk to you with cell phones and telephones and the fact that they live in the same city only a handful of blocks apart etc i think youre getting an answer
7671543 i dont like the business stay away from the stock
7671544 beware the stock since it has some presence in the financial
7671545 we dont know right now because thats what goldman isdoing
7671546 instead of protecting the siv and its investors aspromised defendants exposed the siv to significant undisclosedrisks
7671547 defendants knew the assets purchasedand held by the siv were risky and of poor quality theyfurther knew the models used to generate the high rates wereflawed
7671548 the timeframe really isnt theirs it belongs more to the canadian food inspection agency
7671549 its fucking eerie true to life and death there are many subtle clues regarding the content of the cd
7671550 it was a mutual agreement you need to follow your heart in this business and if you are not into it 100 then it is time to move on we all felt it was the best thing for all parties involved there are no hard feelings im sure eric wagner will continue making music and we wish him the best
7671551 we are very excited to have kory step in and take over the vocals for trouble hes been one of my favorite frontmen in this industry for many years he will add a new dimension that we can use its not like we just picked out some guy to fill in this is one of rocks most dynamic and creative frontmen in the industry i know that when trouble fans get a taste of what kory does they will not be disappointed at all anyone who has seen kory with warrior soul already knows what to expect and its awesome
7671552 this is truly a new low for the republican attack machine and especially disappointing leonard lance would stoop to such levels to avoid talking about the real issues that matter in this election
7671553 how dare they pursue personal attacks on my mother and sister who are trying to get by in the face of horrific economic conditions thanks to the failed policies of president bush and republicans like leonard lance who support him leonard lance owes my mother an apology and should tell the republican party in new jersey to end these disgusting attacks
7671554 are you united i mean come on come on yes
7671555 and you know as extraordinary as barack is i am just as excited about joe biden being on the ticket
7671556 youre hearing a lot about unity today because we as a democratic party need to be united to unite the country
7671557 you look like a groundhog cute and fuzzy you should have invented the pet rock
7671558 el rasgo de la mano izquierda es realmente impresionante para lo fluido seguro y preciso que es
7671559 pese a toda la perplejidad que ello pueda ocasionar tambi n respecto a la falta de informaci n sobre su procedencia la obra es por lo menos por ahora el hallazgo m s importante desde la identificaci n de la dama del armi o
7671560 one day i will look back on this and laugh

7671562 im sorry maam but there are no other kids on this bus
7671563 mom the bus i was on on the first day of school goes here
7671564 however the supply in china is not adequate and this is the reason the company decided to manufacture this cable in the sri lankan plant
7671565 all memory manufactured products are iso 9001 certified and ta memory is fast becoming one of the largest manufacturers of memory modules in the world such volume production reflects the ongoing demand it experiences for product from various retail and oem customers ta has built memory products since 1998 the company has developed proprietary test software which assures the overall quality and functional versatility of the memory product
7671566 im still turning the pedals over so i guess ill keep going
7671567 ma perch non mi hai detto come stavano le cose avrei apprezzato di pi preferisco che me le si dicano le cose
7671568 tiene que ver con la infiltraci n que realizan los narcoparamilitares desde colombia que est n incrementando su nivel de influencia en las frontera colombo venezolana
7671569 la frontera es una frontera viva que est en juego la soberan a y la defensa de la patria
7671570 que rechacen cualquier injerencia que se intenta hacer desde fuera para debilitar su lucha
7671571 lo que est en juego es la soberan a de nuestra patria
7671572 vamos a laborar duro para que en este estado llegue la salud como manda la revoluci n
7671573 existe una necesidad inmediata de intervenir este hospital pero no nada m s con una mesa t cnica sino con todas las soluciones que pueda aportar el gobierno nacional las cuales permitir n acomodar el desastre que dej la actual gobernaci n de acosta carlez
7671574 hern ndez lanz es el responsable directo porque es el secretario de salud de la actual administraci n deber a renunciar si es que le queda algo de verg enza esta gente lo que hizo fue robar todos estos a os y es por ello que se tiene que rescatar el estado carabobo
7671575 se equivoca manuitt si cree que nos va a amedrentar con amenazas
7671576 its more information than youll find almost anywhere else which is why medical identity theft is increasing faster than retail or banking thefts
7671577 also in health care that information is shared with other doctors insurance companies other health care facilities and theres a risk of those other systems not being as secure as they should be
7671578 that infects the computer the employee is working from and it can launch attacks on information on the server
7671579 a growing number of uninsured are using other means of to get their health care
7671580 rather than use their own name theyll use someone elses information like a relative or friend
7671581 so as long as its good who really cares how many there are besides most of those good fps are on the ps3 too like cod4 and that doesnt take away from my enjoyment of it
7671582 that seems to be trend these days isnt it mate
7671583 if it was me obviously id like every game to be on all platforms so id only have to buy one perhaps that could happened in the future but right now it doesnt
7671584 i see where you misunderstood me here im not advocating one platform there could be multiple platforms with all these unique features but games in generation would work or even just be released on all of them as an example say i wanted to buy the wii for its control and price id buy that and be able to get the whole library of games on it obviously the problem would be hardware but if there was a standard much like with the dvd i think it could work out fine i dont know could happened probably wont id like it to because i own the 360 and the ps3 and i desperately want to get rid of one but there are like three exclusives on each that pull me towards keeping them
7671585 so as long as its good who really cares how many there are besides most of those good fps are on the ps3 too like cod4 and that doesnt take away from my enjoyment of it
7671586 so as long as its good who really cares how many there are besides most of those good fps are on the ps3 too like cod4 and that doesnt take away from my enjoyment of it
7671587 snake in my ass literally right now theres a snake in my ass
7671588 earlier we could not understand who could have murdered sohail but later ruby reminded us about the money that shaikh had taken for her admission we suspect that shaikh was not willing not return the money and so decided to kill sohail
7671589 shaikh earlier said that he had attacked sohail after they had a heated argument over a girl but now the admission issue has come up we are still investigating and are verifying all the evidences
7671590 the very idea of the independence rock festival is to provide a platform for talented local rock bands that have the potential to make it big
7671591 thanks to marks outstanding leadership through three decades with our company the mortgage loan with checking investments and insurance became one of our companys four core products and part of the foundation of our companys vision to satisfy all our customers financial needs and help them succeed financially
7671592 his significant role in building one of americas largest and most respected mortgage companies i believe is one of the great success stories in u s financial services hes also built an effective group of major businesses with 47 000 team members that strive to satisfy all the financial needs of our 28 million customers smoothly and efficiently by being there when they need their next financial product
7671593 if theres one word that describes mark for me its integrity
7671594 integrity in the numbers integrity in the process integrity in building the business and doing whats right for the customer and integrity in building a high performing team that collaborates unselfishly as one wells fargo were very fortunate that mark will stay in his current leadership role to ensure a smooth transition our commitment to the des moines area as a major employment center for our company remains as strong as ever
7671595 at this point we believe the consensus opinion among industry professionals is that the next significant hardware refresh is unlikely to occur before 2011 and more likely in 2012
7671596 one possible exception to console timing may be nintendo which could opt to upgrade the wii with faster processing power dvd capability and or greater storage
7671597 this is the most callous attitude of the forest department on the contrary the forest ministry should have come forward to protect the officer
7671598 semindia has sought another 2 3 weeks for financial closure the promoters seem confident of meeting the deadline
7671599 yes we did issue a notice to them now the company has explained to us the reasons for the delay and promised to take the project forward in the next three weeks
7671600 though we warned them on the delays we dont want them to go away we are more interested in the project coming up than taking action against them
7671601 are also not paying the applicable income tax for which they do not have immunity
7671602 indians have become big art collectors until now they have shown interest in art from their own culture
7671603 if hirst can sell to indian art lovers then other non indian artists can also try their luck
7671604 we see no slowdown in handset business on the network side however deals have become more complex there has been some slowdown and deals are taking longer to close we see low to moderate growth in semiconductor business
7671605 globally the network business has become more complex and deals have also become larger but these have binary outcome and hence it is difficult to get predictably of this business
7671606 we decided to reduce the cycle in may 2008 it was communicated to the customers in june so it has been effective from the july cycle there is no particular reason for reducing it the market has a cycle of 46 52 days and we have decided to keep it at 48 days
7671607 the couple however asked rani to do daily chores like washing the tiffins cleaning the kitchen and the house washing clothes and other things
7671608 she was deprived of food whenever she did not complete the jobs assigned to her
7671609 recently she was beaten up badly and her hands were swollen it was only because she dropped a bowl and broke it
7671610 i want to go to school but jahnvi maushi aunty gets angry and slaps me
7671611 initially it was difficult for us to organise grand celebrations for hindu festivals in the christian dominated area

7671615 it is a proud occasion for the laboratory because its work has been appreciated not only by the state and central governments but also internationally
7671616 the officer told the trial court that since the narco analysis is contrary to the prosecution case they have not relied upon it which was accepted the prosecution conducted the test for the benefit of investigation and certain facts were revealed which were regarded as truth is the prosecution not supposed to investigate can an officer himself sit in judgment and say he cannot use it

7671618 he however left the auto rickshaw when he saw that rahul had reached a considerable distance and then went to rahuls residence he opened the door with duplicate keys broke open the cupboard lock using a screw driver and fled with cash worth rs16 25 lakh which he had spotted in the cupboard during the party
7671619 when his friend saw the cupboard ransacked the next day he immediately approached the police and also informed rahul

7671624 i thought he was a really cool person and this was way before he was even a presidential candidate and i liked him a lot
7671625 he invited me to washington and i went we talked about boxing were both boxing fanatics the cool thing about mccain is that the same guy that was senator is the same guy who is running for president now when i talked to him i never felt beneath him he looks directly at me when hes speaking to me and we have the same level of respect for each other
7671626 he said yankee i was a soldier and i saw people die next to me latinos who never got their citizenship but who were willing to die for this country i saw a hernandez i saw a rodriguez how they killed them and that broke my heart hearing that and i went man this guy lived it hes not just going hey i want your vote he lived it
7671627 i was surprised i have to say at how willing to listen he is people who havent met him might get the wrong perception of him but hes totally different
7671628 google hat sein budget f r das kulinarische programm drastisch gek rzt

7671630 not a nasty dirty wet hole filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell nor yet a dry bare sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat it was a hobbit hole and that means comfort
7671631 em termos de organiza o o benfica uma merda comparado com o fc porto

7671694 the debate on when and how to treat early parkinsons disease patients has been ongoing currently treatment would typically be initiated when symptoms have caused disability however providing the medical evidence for a treatment to retard or prevent the progression of pd is a major therapeutic priority and the proud study aims to shed more light into this question pramipexole was considered an optimal candidate for this study due to evidence suggesting possible benefits to pd patients beyond treating the well known core symptoms based on the unique technique used in this study proud may provide a major breakthrough in our understanding of early pd treatment which would offer hope to the ever increasing number of patients diagnosed with parkinsons disease

7672066 its almost as if obama wants to repeat the mistakes of herbert hoover during the great depression hoover raised the top marginal rate to 63 from 25 and hiked corporate taxes too says michael aronstein chief investment strategist at oscar gruss amp son in new york the moves siphoned needed investment capital out of the markets and into the hands of bureaucrats delaying the turnaround
7672067 our companys substantial net asset value is not reflected in our stock price

7672081 biden has a real connect to south jersey there are parts of south jersey that are closer to delaware than they are to new york and north jersey
7672082 if he does not or for whatever reason in the future i do have interest in it ive never hidden that but my focus right now has to be on the office for which i was elected

7672091 as to the timing cti was advised by financial experts that this was the right step at the right time since we have significant milestone opportunities in the near future

7672093 our armies do not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies but as liberators your wealth has been stripped of you by unjust men the government of iraq and the future of your country will soon belong to you we will end a brutal regime so that the iraqis can live in security
7672094 honduras se incorpora a la gran familia del alba el alba de oro el alba de los pueblos a pesar de los ataques de los eternos enemigos de los pobres de los eternos enemigos de los pueblos que han tenido la oportunidad de gobernar durante siglos y como resultado han dejado hambre desempleo y pobreza
7672095 no comunican el contenido de los mismos ni a sus pueblos ni a los medios internacionales de prensa
7672096 la que ha tenido apoyo del alba en el campo energ tico sin embargo en el pa s no se saborea cu ll es la diferencia que podr a haber si no tuvi ramos en la alternativa bolivariana para las am ricas
7672097 nicaragua ya no sigue sufriendo los racionamientos de energ a hasta de 8 horas que nos recetaba el gobierno de enrique bola os pero hasta este momento no hemos escuchado con detalles que es lo que nos ha beneficiado cu l es el cambio c mo podemos comparar la nicaragua con alba y la nicaragua sin alba
7672098 creo que quienes coordinan el alba pierden una oportunidad enorme porque no saben comunicar y no se sabe cu l es la importancia de estar dentro de ese acuerdo y esto no solo para el caso de nicaragua sino que ahora para honduras porque si uno le pregunta a los ciudadanos hondure os que importancia tiene que su pa s se adhiera a ese tratado ni siquiera idea tienen
7672099 te abre nuevos mercados y si lo que habr que valorar porque no existe informaci n ni datos es que tan importante es invertir y vender en el marco del alba invertir o vender del cafta o de otros tratados bilaterales o multilaterales que puedan tener los pa ses de la regi n
7672100 por la falta de comunicaci n porque si las cosas son a como aparentemente han dicho en algunos discursos como los presidente hugo ch vez y evo morales pareciera ser que el alba es exitosa y que se desarrolla en un marco muy sostenible
7672101 la que la noto muy sostenible pero muy ligada al mercado caribe o y por eso es que es necesario de quienes dirigen el alba deben dar informaci n m s sostenible y no informaci n de discursos sino informaci n t cnica
7672102 i wanted to make it for everybody not just urban but every race every color every creed whatever
7672103 im only human i might just tell a lie im only human im an angel in disguise
7672104 ill be ready no matter what i was hoping i could play last week against philadelphia coach made the decision not to have me play well see what the plan is for this week im not sure
7672105 if i dont play ill be ready for kansas city
7672106 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7672107 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7672108 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7672109 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7672110 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7672111 this is planetary destabilization and its already begun the question is how do we arrest this before it gets to the point of catastrophe
7672112 the earth could be free of arctic summer ice within our lifetime
7672113 this has not happened as far as we know in 130 000 years as long as human beings have existed on the planet
7672114 if you had a gauge in your car reading in the red zone how long would you feel comfortable driving down the highway like that thats where we are now
7672115 he said you dont understand were going to ban the sale of new automobiles in this country
7672116 if we were to move to the most efficient lighting technologies available today we could reduce electricity demand by 12 percent
7672117 in the new energy economy we see 40 percent of the worlds electricity coming from wind
7672118 that would require building roughly a million and a half wind turbines over the next dozen years now a million and a half may sound like a lot but we make 65 million cars a year
7672119 i mention that just to give a sense of how much renewable energy there is out there three states in the u s kansas north dakota and texas have enough energy capacity to power the whole country
7672120 from being a nation of energy consumers to being a nation of energy producers
7672121 wouldnt it be nice if you put solar panels on your house you got a check in the mail farmers in germany now have a new revenue stream
7672122 we have the solutions we just need to come up with the political will to get those technologies out there even faster
7672123 we believe in using nonviolent civil disobedience at times when its necessary to incite change it takes me to jail sometimes
7672124 as i look around the room i see some of the people ive been to jail with here today
7672125 we cant have half measures we dont have time to lose we have to hit the ground running
7672126 now is the time to speak the truth and bring new people into the political process
7672127 are we going to have the biggest political failure in the history of the world
7672128 jag r inte r dd f r tandl karen s drop the act
7672129 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7672130 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7672131 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7672132 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7672133 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7672134 for proof denies faith and without faith i am nothing
7672135 oh good so i dont have to apologize for being the same way
7672136 for the love of money is the root of all evil
7672137 we continue to believe the gses are best equipped to provide needed mortgage market stability
7672138 however recent market pressures make it more difficult for them to execute their mission potentially forcing management and policymakers to take extraordinary actions
7672139 for the love of money is the root of all evil
7672140 youve got more of the concerns weve seen about credit and the financials lehmans down because of the speculation that the bid is not happening and theres a negative report on aig
7672141 the credit crisis is more than a year old and still there are lots and lots of issues
7672142 investor psychology is certainly suffering from credit crisis fatigue people are disappointed that the situation is not visibly improving
7672143 clearly there is no light at the end of the housing tunnel yet
7672144 the supply of unsold homes is still very high suggesting theres going to be downward pressure on prices well into 2009

7672146 this just furthers the economic development we can bring to kansas and adds to our motor sports portfolio by allowing other forms of racing
7672147 we can cater to a whole new demographic with car clubs
7672148 we are trying to provide the best opportunity for kansas
7672149 we are going to continue creating wealth for the state
7672150 if we arent awarded the contract we just cant make it work
7672151 i dont know how to throw it in the mix at this point
7672152 these and other issues will come up and we will be asking them about that
7672153 i was holding the medal for three days to make sure its not a dream its real
7672154 its a disappointing and vulgar attack on john mccain who has devoted his life to the cause of freedom and the fight against tyranny
7672155 but its not surprising that barack obama and his fellow celebrities stick together
7672156 estaba muy agradecida por el inter s y los pedidos del papa durante su tiempo como prisionera por eso cuando fue liberada pidi la oportunidad de reunirse con l y agradecerle
7672157 it was just a matter of making the schedules mesh

7672162 weaved through traffic in a construction zone creating a gap between himself and the trooper
7672163 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7672164 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7672165 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7672166 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7672167 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7672168 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7672169 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7672170 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7672171 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7672172 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7672173 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7672174 we believe prosocial behaviour is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7672175 mr dion is essentially refusing to meet and not only refusing to meet refusing to speak by phone
7672176 this is a sign that hes for all intents and purposes broken off communication with the prime minister
7672177 sending canadians into a 400 million federal election wont be decided over the phone or a text message the issues facing canadians are too important
7672178 hes certainly not going to give harper a blank cheque
7672179 in the age of modern communication if somebodys saying they cant find a way to talk to you with cell phones and telephones and the fact that they live in the same city only a handful of blocks apart etc i think youre getting an answer
7672180 its not a statesman were dealing with here its a quitter
7672181 the red ink is rising around virginia s budget politicians are scrambling for items to trim and pare while others are clucking their tongues in self satisfaction
7672182 they have no right to do so behind every budget crisis including this one there is a bipartisan gaggle of pols who gleefully voted to increase spending even when prudence and common sense dictated that a bit of restraint was in order
7672183 tels generally work around a couple of principles spending increases are limited to some combination of inflation and population growth and any excess revenues are rebated to the taxpayers these are tough laws designed to keep politicians on a very short budgetary leash because they tend to take a lot of the fun out of being a legislator politicians generally oppose them as do the numerous interest groups and associations dedicated to milking the public purse
7672184 it is historically undeniable that as a group politicians cannot be trusted with taxpayers money given the opportunity they will spend it all and then pawn whatever they can lay their hands on to spend even more
7672185 literally dozens of studies show that there is an inverse relationship between the overall tax burden and economic growth higher taxes lower growth this relationship holds for different areas time periods and ways of measuring growth
7672186 adjusting for the effects of inflation and population growth the budget increased by 38 percent and average annual increase of 3 7 percent
7672187 saskatchewan has the lowest employment rate among its off reserve aboriginal population of the western provinces
7672188 many of the youth we were dealing with if they were not gang members going into jail they certainly were coming out

7672193 as of 10 am on august 22 the number of confirmed data breaches stood at 449 the actual number of breaches is most likely higher due to under reporting and the fact that some of the breaches reported which affect multiple businesses are listed as single events the group said
7672194 linda foley itrc founder attributes part of the growth of the itrcs breach list to the ability to access state attorney general notification lists that contain breaches that were not reported via media or other sources
7672195 as we near what we originally expected to be the full length of the mission we are all thrilled with how well the mission is going

7672197 the appeal of stone soup is that this deep area may collect and concentrate different kinds of materials
7672198 the trough between polygons is sort of a trap where things can accumulate
7672199 over a long timescale there may even be circulation of material sinking at the margins and rising at the center
7672200 we had a shootout between stone soup and white stuff in a trench called upper cupboard
7672201 if we had been able to confirm that the white material was a salt rich deposit we would have analyzed that but we were unable to confirm that with various methods

7672214 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill

7672220 it is completely different in japan they do not have heat with the middle east over there
7672221 it is more like an athletic contest in japan you know who leads and who follows
7672222 i thought it was a great way for me to get in the door at tna
7672223 i am really happy with what they have planned for me
7672224 they are super receptive to my ideas 99 of the time i hit the key points but i make it my own
7672225 going off the ropes can be a little more difficult
7672226 i feel he was one of the best supporting characters in wrestling history
7672227 take advice from everyone and use what applies to you
7672228 this is our tragic geopolitical fate but this is not 1921 they could not invade tbilisi they could not subjugate all georgia and nobody could make legal the annexation of our territory
7672229 i think western pressure already put on russia has had its effect
7672230 it works and it will work because russia depends on the west its not the soviet union that was self sufficient russia will have to somehow learn how to play by internationally recognized rules they cannot go unpunished
7672231 they dont have any right to do so they might attempt it testing the patience of the georgian government as well as the western allies
7672232 they will try to go as far as they are allowed i dont think its implementable but they might say something like that they might demand such stupid action
7672233 they want to strangle the georgian economy to make the georgian people as unhappy as possible in order for them to turn against their own government
7672234 its basically a subversion plan carried out by russian government against sovereign georgia
7672235 arkansas needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers
7672236 we need to publicly affirm the gold standard of rearing children whenever we can the state standard should be as close to that gold standard of married mom and dad homes as possible

7672263 theres a concern about the audience coming into this world i respect their need to draw in an audience and present this a certain way
7672264 thats why i hit myself on the head for this

7672295 we virgin group are keeping the remaining 20 percent because of our firm belief in nigeria and our desire to continue to invest in the nigerian economy
7672296 this is what is happening hopefully by september the board will meet and ratify what has been prepared and individual nigerians and institutional investors will then buy and own virgin nigeria

7672306 i think ive just found another way to keep the supplies coming and best of all they will come straight to me this is terrific in oh so many ways
7672307 i have never had such great service from an su demonstrator and i used to be one holy cow girl you rock
7672308 i love the fact that i can go to your site anytime you can bet ill be back and place an order
7672309 the clintons love this country and they love the democratic party
7672310 they are going to be active parts of our campaign for the remaining 70 days
7672311 could not be more clear about their support for my candidacy
7672312 there are going to be some of senator clintons supporters who were going to have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
7672313 but if you take a look this week i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7672314 i am confident that everything will be just fine on wednesday night
7672315 ive tried not to have long discussions about short lists long lists
7672316 but ive said publicly before and i will repeat again that senator clinton would be on anybodys short list so i took her very seriously
7672317 i said as much to him three or four days ago
7672318 bill clinton is a unique figure in our politics this is the only person the only democrat who has been re elected since f d r and he is somebody who is equally adept at talking about domestic issues and foreign policy issues
7672319 obama is cool and all but i fuck with mccain
7672320 these are genuine documents nobody can challenge you just give me your photographs and choose a name in four weeks youll have a new identity
7672321 because bulgarias in the european community you have full rights in this country you can live here legally take advantage of the free nhs everything and no one can stop you travelling
7672322 i was so furious i came straight to the news of the world not only is it against our religion to commit fraud these documents could be used by extremists
7672323 i can help we can make as many passports as you want
7672324 when i was five i was in the co op one day with my mum and we saw this man
7672325 i said whos that it turned out it was my dad since then ive seen him on sundays when he shows up my mums staying in b amp b in blackpool now but i just want to be with her i love my mum to bits and i miss her i just want her back
7672326 theres something quite fundamental about the culture and approach of an organisation like ours i think at the heart of it is a real focus on the idea of personalisation it strikes me it doesnt matter whether its a private voluntary or statutory entity i think what people are trying to reach for is a model of interacting with young people that operates at that personal level
7672327 i just used to stay in bed all day and get stoned
7672328 all i cared about was where my next joint was coming from
7672329 i was used to mixing with older people they were just like babies themselves i would sit in a classroom and someone would say something and then id say something back and start arguing and then id get emotional and walk out
7672330 prus are very good at getting the right destinations for young people but six months down the line if we check them out how many will still be there
7672331 these young people are more likely to have ongoing crises or critical incidents in their lives which need to be supported what they need is that little bit extra going the extra mile
7672332 for the first time we are being very very proactive about these young people so they can move smoothly into employment and more positive lives
7672333 i dont underestimate the scale of the challenge i know many of these young people come from chaotic lives but they will now be tracked we will know whats happening to them its never too late when there are wonderful voluntary organisations working in the community education is lifelong
7672334 i hate school i just dont like it i dont learn anything at school
7672335 here they dont talk to you like teachers they talk to you like friends
7672336 if i could turn back time i would do it all different
7672337 if i could do it again i wouldnt get stoned every day to be honest with you i didnt really care about my future until now
7672338 the economics department is small compared to some of its rivals
7672339 the people who have the most money have the most truth
7672340 a symbiosis of a certain kind of donor with a certain kind of institute
7672341 this is a big departure from the mission of the university
7672342 to set up an institute with no criticism from outside would be silly to us thats not our ambition
7672343 make the university safe for free markets the same way that the chicago boys made the world safe for free enterprise
7672344 following friedmans lead the design and evaluation of economic policy requires analyses that respect the incentives of individuals and the essential role of markets in allocating goods and services as friedman and others continually demonstrated design of public policy without regard to market alternatives has adverse social consequences
7672345 just what is it that you good thinking guys and gals have against human freedom
7672346 pretty explicitly as an economic research institute without a particular ideology
7672347 that shows the contempt with which these people treat those who dont share their orthodoxy
7672348 the centre contradicts the spirit of inquiry openness and give and take that a university ought to be devoted to
7672349 data from the youth cohort study shows that the gap in five a c attainment in gcses between highest and lowest social classes was 40 percentage points in 1989 rising to 49 in 1998 and down to 44 by 2004 so you could argue labour is just undoing the damage that the tories did
7672350 there is a good deal of other recently published data that shows that on key indicators the social class gap has reduced slightly since 2004 taken as a whole goves document shows extreme carelessness or disregard for truth and accuracy he is right that inequalities are too high but we need a proper debate about this and what to do about it if he wants to be taken seriously he should withdraw this document and re enter the debate when he has a better grasp of the evidence
7672351 the wrong data was published by the department for children schools and families dcsf and was provided to him in answer to a parliamentary question earlier this year however the data is clearly wrong because the totals differ from the figures given for girls and boys
7672352 millions of pupils have left school with little to show for their education during a decade of persistent failure
7672353 if we look at the percentage figures which take into account the size of cohort and the trend what the data actually shows is that between 1997 and 2007 there was a drop from 6 to 4 in the proportion of pupils not entered for any gcses a drop from 8 to 5 in the proportion not getting above a g in any subject and a drop from 30 to 23 in the proportion not getting above a c in any subject so there is no evidence for a decade of persistent failure
7672354 this is a skewed and partial analysis which reflects an ideological agenda
7672355 all the figures we used were drawn from parliamentary answers or the governments own publicly available statistics others can draw different interpretations from these figures but it is unarguable that the level of educational inequality in england is indefensible
7672356 virtually every initiative the government has taken in this area including london challenge excellence in cities education maintenance allowances aim higher and the reading recovery programmes has been positively evaluated
7672357 but they are only chipping away at the problem effecting real change takes a long time and a great deal of money
7672358 weve got to be prepared to be more radical in how we resource and run schools and in the curriculum we teach
7672359 until more than a few decide to stop pandering to the profitable establishment business that is modern schooling we are unlikely to see the changes required to our education system
7672360 if i want my children to have the education i think they deserve ill be teaching most of it to them
7672361 i had classmates of all kinds all types of people from all types of backgrounds not people chosen by my parents among a cosy group they considered suitable
7672362 its obvious that some children would benefit far more from being educated in a home real life context equally there are some children you wouldnt dream of educating in a home setting
7672363 how do home schooled children learn science without access to laboratories or supplies
7672364 if i remember rightly at my old school the bunsen burners were mainly used for setting fire to girls ponytails and the sulphuric acid was used to murder the tadpoles
7672365 the course has exceeded my expectations even we so called muslim experts need to expand our understanding instead of just accepting the subjective view from my background for instance one of my tutors has lent me books by mainstream non muslim academics on subjects like islamic family law
7672366 i feel that this course is the only one of its kind that deals with muslims in societies where theyre in a majority as well as a minority
7672367 ive known him since 1999 when we were both speaking at the oxford centre for islamic studies
7672368 but that doesnt stop him putting me through it when we meet at warwick
7672369 the chaplain at a top university like warwick tells me that there are at least 1 000 muslim students
7672370 in this study to design and develop socks that provide wearing comfort the way of preventing slipping down of socks top parts is investigated the subjects are 10 males who walk on a running machine with changing stitches of leg and heel parts partly in the socks pressure values of top parts of socks during walking experiment are measured and the slippage of the top are evaluated
7672371 the top part of socks becomes difficult to slip down with the purl stitches of leg part partly because of the decrease of extending down the leg part by the foot part the variation of pressure values is large in the front region and the variation of pressure values is small in the back region during walking because of the hardness of skin when the movement of an ankle is strong the slippage of top parts increases but using stitches that have big extension decreases the slippage effectively
7672372 i didnt sleep all night long i was so worried
7672373 i might go back to bed and get them posted
7672374 im just texting a couple of mates telling them how well zoe did in her exams
7672375 absolutely has no organizational links ties or associations with any of the islamic organizations in the u s
7672376 its not only or necessarily ahmadinejad who speaks to the imam
7672377 theres a whole new second generation elite of the revolutionary guard irgc who indoctrinate their troops with the belief in the need to hasten the advent of the imam this has also spread to hizballah in lebanon
7672378 barack obamas father was muslim and therefore according to islamic law so is the candidate in spite of the quranic verses explaining that there is no compulsion in religion a muslim child takes the religion of his or her father for muslims around the world non american muslims at any rate they can only ever see barack hussein obama as a muslim
7672379 he has to be good for arabs because he is a muslim
7672380 he cant be a christian his middle name is hussein
7672381 the symbolism of a major american presidential candidate with the middle name of hussein who went to elementary school in indonesia
7672382 dont really understand obamas family tree but what they do know is that if america despite being attacked by muslim militants on 9 11 were to elect as its president some guy with the middle name hussein it would mark a sea change in america muslim world relations
7672383 exploit his background to argue that an apostate is leading the global war on terror to galvanize sympathizers into action
7672384 i received my order today and everything is great ill be back you made the experience trouble free and fast
7672385 thank you for all you do for everyone but especially for taking the time out of your busy schedule to answer my question
7672386 my stampin up order came today just as you said it would and i love everything thanks for an outstanding experience purchasing from you
7672387 i was so happy buying through you thanks again for such great service i will be back
7672388 your beautiful work on your website is a real inspiration with great ideas and technique tips
7672389 i am sure i will be back to shop with you again in the near future
7672390 i wait with bated breath for your daily creation i am so impressed with your creative output
7672391 you have been so amazing working with me to maximize my savings and helping me out with my questions i would definitely order from you again in the future
7672392 i think ive just found another way to keep the supplies coming and best of all they will come straight to me this is terrific in oh so many ways
7672393 i have never had such great service from an su demonstrator and i used to be one holy cow girl you rock
7672394 i love the fact that i can go to your site anytime you can bet ill be back and place an order
7672395 to be part of the 2008 olympic team to play with the best players in the world and to be on this team its just amazing
7672396 it really meant a lot to me especially after the last two seasons that ive had injury wise and that the miami heat have had it can bring us back to life not just me but bring miami back i had a lot to prove going over there
7672397 for our team for myself individually to come out and have that kind of performance early in the first half to keep us afloat it really meant a lot to me personally after all the things that have been said and all the question marks about whether i was even going to make the team and i became a big part of the team
7672398 theres been a lot that went on in my life to get to this point
7672399 when i won a championship everything was going great as an adult nothing went wrong ive had a lot of things that went bad since then
7672400 you quiet people but you dont completely shut them up
7672401 i always wonder why people steal things but to reach the all time low level of stealing from your providers of safety i just dont know
7672402 certainly were gonna re evaluate our security measures around our stations
7672403 its just a shame that for years and years and years the fire stations have been places that were welcoming to the public the doors are always open you can come in if you need us
7672404 i do feel a lot more comfortable carrying a gun
7672405 the way the economy is and everything you never know who youre going to run into or what kind of person theyre going to be theres a lot of nuts out there
7672406 its just the fact that you never know what youre going to come in contact with
7672407 to protect me and my family and my grandkids and my kids great grandkids well i wanted to carry something like that to protect me in case
7672408 in a class of twelve those four or five folks who may be 50 60 plus 70 plus end up shootin better than the 20 25 30 year olds cause they take it serious its not a joke its not a game to them
7672409 i now understand what i can and cannot do here that i really didnt fully understand before
7672410 i love it because it is as glamorous as the foreign soap operas american and mexican we sometimes watch
7672411 but at the same time the family in noor is muslim and they have similar traditions and customs so we relate to them much more
7672412 i really like their belief in tradition and their loyalty to the family
7672413 in my opinion old men who want to marry girls at the age of their granddaughters are mentally sick and need psychological treatment
7672414 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
7672415 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
7672416 weve got our little one going off to kindergarten so i thought wed have one last hurrah as a family try it out
7672417 at one point we were a little concerned and a few spots in the maze we had to rethink our design because of the moisture
7672418 it actually was weeks and weeks because there werent many days in a row we could do it all at one time
7672419 ideally you cut it when its under knee high but we cut it when it was over our heads
7672420 i promise we wont rest until we bring about the release of all the prisoners
7672421 despite the great happiness we know that there is also sadness over those who were left behind 11 000 who have yet to be released
7672422 i was dead until the moment i met you i was a powerless corpse pretending to be alive living without power without the ability to change my course was akin to a slow death
7672423 i take a chip and i eat it just as planned
7672424 susah untuk kembali fokus dan menyiapkan diri untuk as terbuka kemarin saya mencoba tidur tapi tidak bisa karena saya menonton upacara penutupan dan pikiran saya masih di sana
7672425 di rusia kalau anda menghentikan seseorang di jalanan dan menanyakan apa itu grand slam saya pikir tidak banyak yang tahu tapi semua orang tahu olimpiade tak ada yang lebih besar dari itu untuk seorang atlet olahragawan tak ada yang lebih penting dibanding olimpiade
7672426 saya memegangnya terus selama tiga hari untuk memastikan bahwa ini bukanlah mimpi ini nyata
7672427 orang orang mendatangi saya dan berkata oh saya ikut senang untuk kamu kami selalu kalah di final akan luar biasa kalau akhirnya kita bisa memenangi sesuatu yang besar
7672428 because no one wants an angry african american in the white house

7672430 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7672431 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7672432 iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki said monday there will be no agreement on a u
7672433 yeah that girl i was gonna call for a date she was unlisted and now heres her number
7672434 its probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind
7672435 what am i doing im dating a woman who happens to be sponsoring one of these walkers
7672436 let me tell you something about that tag its no 31 and uh lets just leave it at that
7672437 yes yes before they went off the market i mean now ive got to re evaluate my whole screening process i cant afford to waste any of em
7672438 we had to manage with 237 and there was some worry when we used a fifth bowler but yuvraj bowled well
7672439 he turned the ball and that really worked for us the conditions are slow here and your part timers will have an effect but we dont have a virender sehwag or sachin tendulkar who turn the ball consistently we have to see who is bowling well on a particular day and use him hopefully there wont be a day when none of them work out

7672448 there are significant growth opportunities for australias international luxury travel market australia is a world class destination with a diverse range of experiences to offer the wealthy traveller including an increasing range of five star plus accommodation
7672449 staging the symposium in australia gives our industrys luxury suppliers an exceptional opportunity to showcase their products and services many of which the symposium delegates will be able to experience first hand
7672450 surprisingly robust in the first quarter but weakened sharply during the second quarter
7672451 i think there are still retailers out there who underestimate the importance of the internet
7672452 travel retailers who have an offline presence combined with an online presence are in a far better position
7672453 weve done a lot of research on this and certainly there is a big part of the market that will research online
7672454 but there is a big part of the market that want to have the reassurance and confidence and experience they get through a travel agent
7672455 basically baby boomers make up the majority of our customers and they are not as internet savvy as the younger generations they are more than happy to leave all the travel arrangements to us
7672456 i think the key thing is that it does vary for the type of travel people are doing
7672457 if you go for something more complex with multiple stops for example people are far more likely to go to travel agents
7672458 on the other hand if you are looking for a simple domestic point to point trip youd probably jump online and go through a booking engine
7672459 a lot of the attraction is that the travel agent has some insider knowledge on good deals or what is the best way to get there whats the most efficient route or where you should stay when you get there
7672460 personally i feel that the role of the travel agent will continue to exist and people will rely on their experience

7672486 tourism is too important to be left to the marketers it needs to be managed and owned by the community to insure that the benefits are realized
7672487 people keep looking for originality they dont want to recreate their experience in your town they want to enjoy what the town has to offer
7672488 cities have needs that visitors can financially support by balancing the tourism infrastructure with existing city services the year round resident has a higher quality of life

7672505 mr dion is essentially refusing to meet and not only refusing to meet refusing to speak by phone
7672506 this is a sign that hes for all intents and purposes broken off communication with the prime minister
7672507 sending canadians into a 400 million federal election wont be decided over the phone or a text message the issues facing canadians are too important
7672508 hes certainly not going to give harper a blank cheque
7672509 in the age of modern communication if somebodys saying they cant find a way to talk to you with cell phones and telephones and the fact that they live in the same city only a handful of blocks apart etc i think youre getting an answer

7672511 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7672512 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7672513 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7672514 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7672515 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7672516 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7672517 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7672518 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7672519 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7672520 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7672521 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7672522 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7672523 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7672524 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7672525 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7672526 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7672527 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7672528 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7672529 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7672530 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7672531 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7672532 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7672533 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7672534 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7672535 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7672536 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7672537 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7672538 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7672539 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7672540 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7672541 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7672542 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7672543 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7672544 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7672545 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7672546 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7672547 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7672548 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7672549 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7672550 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7672551 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7672552 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7672553 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7672554 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7672555 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7672556 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7672557 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7672558 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7672559 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7672560 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7672561 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7672562 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7672563 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7672564 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7672565 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7672566 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7672567 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7672568 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7672569 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7672570 mas por que gritar quando a outra pessoa est ao seu lado
7672571 bem gritamos porque desejamos que a outra pessoa nos ou a
7672572 ent o n o poss vel falar lhe em voz baixa
7672573 voc s sabem porque se grita com uma pessoa quando se est aborrecido
7672574 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7672575 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7672576 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7672577 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7672578 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7672579 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7672580 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7672581 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7672582 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7672583 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7672584 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7672585 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7672586 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7672587 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7672588 now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain
7672589 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7672590 vollee service requires high speed connections so you need to have a 3g or wifi enabled phone 3g hspa ev do umts we currently have players compatible with over 40 handsets and more are being added all the time should your phone not be in the list of the currently supported one register nonetheless and we will contact you when your phone is supported
7672591 we also need to figure out where were going to get salt and how much it will cost
7672592 im going to ask the attorney general to look into this because i believe its a blatant attempt at price fixing
7672593 there are a lot of questions i have as a public official as to how the state handled this
7672594 the pipeline was empty in march of last year all year the mines have been running flat out
7672595 i cant tell you if theres going to be enough for everybody to have what theyve bid
7672596 i was at three shows of mommas man this weekend and there was a lot of love for director azazel and his
7672597 ellen cotter at the angelika is really behind the film and is giving it every chance to continue to grow its audience
7672598 which averaged 10 531 on one screen and a bit behind its biggest 2008 hit
7672599 we had a really terrific team working on the film so our expectations were pretty high and i think high expectations have been fulfilled because the ifc gross was stupendous
7672600 up the yangtze has done really well and for this film i have higher expectations
7672601 we open our films in orange county we do it normally and it was requested so we assumed the theater owners would know whether their audience would like it but its probably a rather conservative audience and that this film is going to play at least initially better to a more open minded liberal audience
7672602 since the grosses at ifc was really so good the expansion will grow by leaps and bounds
7672603 weve already been called by a lot theaters today and we will continue to book theatres
7672604 the process that we are exploiting in the marketing publicity and distribution strategy of the film is one where we wanted to get the word of mouth from the ground
7672605 which is why a lot of people were surprised we went so wide and we know that word of mouth works and we know the playability of the film is strong so we took that approach and hoped that the total impact of that stategy would be a slightly better gross than we got from the weekend but at the same time feed into wednesdays expansion as well
7672606 i have to say the first one for me was the most memorable not for political but for personal reasons my first daughter was born nine months to the day after that one as she later remarked chicago in 68 wasnt all fighting in the streets
7672607 cbss schieffer shares how daughter was conceived at 68 convention
7672608 hillary has fought for universal health care for all her life the mccain plan is respectfully a joke sen obama has a real good plan to bring health care to every american
7672609 she cares about that if she didnt shed be a bad person and shes a very good person
7672610 i think that a lot of women when they think about moving towards government run system of health care which is really what sen obama is talking about theyre going to be a little bit cautious
7672611 they recognize that while free health care or however sen clinton and sen obama wants to bill it could be really expensive at the end of the day and create lower qualities of care and higher quality of care is really what most women are concerned about
7672612 he touches all the bases so he very definitely is targeting women and he needs to because without consulting hillary or even pursuing her for the vice president position hes lost ground with women and he obviously thinks his health care plan will be something that will get women on board
7672613 solving problems that are much more important to the entire world
7672614 its not unreasonable to say were inheriting a budget thats going to have substantial deficits into the future
7672615 said a democratic congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity so he could speak candidly
7672616 leaving some of the tax cuts in place would cost us a small fortune
7672617 i dont know that any blue dog has a good way to pay for that

7672651 pero no hay palabra de consuelo ante tanto dolor esta tragedia me ha endurecido y como mi hija ya no pienso tragar un sapo
7672652 all pasaron cosas pero una la que a m me parece grave es que de pronto algunas familias compet an con otras respecto al dolor que sent a cada cual en fin poco menos que si t tienes menos razones para sufrir que yo que he perdido dos hijos y cosas parecidas ins litas actitudes que daban verg enza y por eso no se constituy la asociaci n de afectados as de claro cuando t que llevas una pena tan grande encima escuchas esas cosas no quieres saber nada de nada sa es la realidad de lo que pas horroroso ese comportamiento en esa situaci n de tanta tristeza no s si porque est bamos agotados destrozados y doloridos no s pero asombra que en ocasiones como stas haya brotado en algunas familias lo peor del ser humano

7672685 there was nothing in the assignment and nothing in ms zlotnicks legal dilemma that should have caused mr aretakis to hijack her litigation for his own personal reasons
7672686 furthermore this decision serves as a written warning that the court will not tolerate sanctionable conduct by mr aretakis in any future litigation before this court
7672687 our country was founded on principles involving freedom of speech and the opportunity to criticize public officials
7672688 this decision should be read in its entirety by every lawyer or citizen who cherishes these fundamental rights it is a historical fact that over the decades that politicians law enforcement and the courts have helped the catholic church avoid our criminal and civil courts and responsibility for their priests having sex with our children
7672689 in my opinion this judge is attempting to punish me and attack my credibility for my extensive efforts as one of two lawyers in the state of new york who have effectively exposed these issues
7672690 congratulations why dont you run for the senate or president of the united states and do something about it
7672691 i t is absolutely improper for a trained lawyer to file a bogus federal law suit in an effort to vent about his personal dissatisfaction with government
7672692 the court has already recited the scurrilous allegations concerning sex abuse the identification of specific priests as sexual predators and other sundry allegations that have absolutely nothing to do with this lawsuit including an ad hominem attack on defense counsel
7672693 we try to treat it as its not much but you know with budget crises and gas crises were going to have to stop once for gas on the plane were taking its not going to be a real easy trip
7672694 i see you guys snickering in the back but i dont know rutgers when they come to california in a few years their budgets probably 15 16 million more than ours so they probably will have a plane that can make it all the way but if we stop we stop
7672695 systematically and deliberately commingled client money and appropriated it for his own purposes
7672696 in spite of mr mcintyres insistence that no client ever lost a dime this is not the standard
7672697 the supreme court has stated that the moment the lawyer succumbs to a temptation to appropriate for his own use any of his clients money entrusted to his safekeeping is the moment he shows his unfitness to be a practicing lawyer
7672698 want to go out of their way to shine and make themselves look terrific
7672699 when you go to input billing and you see somebody is 60 90 120 days delinquent you follow up with a phone call or you maybe dont take on a new matter thats going to require a lot of labor it helps significantly at least to know your attorneys and staff know what theyre dealing with that theyre not operating in the dark
7672700 law firms are notorious in terms of waiting until the end of the year to concentrate on collecting receivables
7672701 many law firms have gotten better at this in recent years its still a problem for many
7672702 lawyers train their clients as to when they want to be paid
7672703 if every year they delay collection efforts until october and november they are training their clients that they dont have to pay in the first half of the year and they dont have to pay promptly
7672704 clients tend to hoard their cash which means they delay payments to vendors which include lawyers the result being significant slowdowns in collections for law firms which can cause serious cash flow difficulties
7672705 we had to respond to that which we did and very effectively so that by the end of july that over 90 day amount had receded back to the lower end of our historical norm for 90 day account receivables which is 38 percent
7672706 you hope that attorneys will always be cognizant of what their clients owe
7672707 we had one of the partners meet personally with each of the attorneys to discuss their high accounts receivable and what plans they were making to call the clients and make arrangements to be sure it was paid
7672708 we have spent a lot of effort on client intake really reviewing the clients and screening them and i think you have to increase that vigilance and those efforts in these economic times
7672709 we dont let clients get behind and then try to round them up
7672710 we try to have periodic cleanup periods for clients that might be lagging a bit and i try to do it quarterly
7672711 if in fact theres someone where we have fallen off their payment radar screen we try and make sure that we touch base with them periodically and make sure there are no problems with their perception of our services and explain to them that we need to be paid like anybody else
7672712 theres no one size fits all we monitor it pretty much weekly we know where every dollar is outstanding and why
7672713 borrowing is up significantly which tells us two things firms are investing tremendously in new cases which we know isnt necessarily the case or collections arent coming in
7672714 as a lender you start to become concerned when your clients cant pay back their debt or when the pay down takes longer than it used to were in no place where were uncomfortable
7672715 its not that simple because we have a clientele of very sophisticated very strong real estate investors developers entrepreneurs who im not worried about at all
7672716 its just not as simple as saying youve got to worry about the real estate industry you really have to take it client by client
7672717 law firms are reluctant to do it because it may be difficult to get a lawsuit resolved in an expedited manner
7672718 i generally go along with it unless theres some other aspect to it that i might want to address with them
7672719 law firms dont want to antagonize the general counsel of a long term client with whom they have a long term relationship
7672720 i think that the rate increase in 2009 will be modest compared to the prior five years
7672721 por qu tenemos que seguir nosotros soportando la burocracia del estado nacional ineficiente que no llega a ning n lugar del pa s
7672722 wed follow you to hell sir but you damned sure didnt go that direction
7672723 i believe by pulling off literally about a third of the work of police officers nowadays its just like adding 30 percent more cops on the streets in terms of effectiveness
7672724 they are committing so many crimes that they may rack up three crimes before they even get to trial on the first one
7672725 and those are precisely the high volume offenders career criminals who do a crime a day
7672726 you have to believe that you can affect crime to the tune of 20 or 30 percent if not better twenty to 30 percent i think we can do it its been done we have to try it
7672727 las revisiones t cnicas vehiculares siguen siendo obligatorias en lima metropolitana por lo que el cronograma de revisiones t cnicas contin a siendo el mismo

7672730 las cr ticas que recibe la cvr se dan porque agarramos carne
7672731 el que se siga atacando a al cvr como se hace quiere decir que hemos tocado carne y que las conciencias no est n del todo tranquilas hay que leer el informe porque si se hiciera eso no se dir an las tremendas torpezas y estupideces que algunos de los cr ticos pronuncian es de personas muy poco inteligentes el fanatizarse y solo ver un lado del asunto lo que dijo la cvr forma parte de la historia del pa s y no se va a borrar a menos que borremos nuestro pasado nuestras cosas buenas y malas
7672732 la comisi n de la verdad fue la voz de aquellos que no la ten an
7672733 las cr ticas que recibe la cvr se dan porque agarramos carne
7672734 they have no knowledge who carry about their wooden idols and keep on praying to a god that cannot save
7672735 moses gave you circumcision not that it is from moses but from the fathers and you circumcise a man on the sabbath
7672736 just so i tell you there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety nine righteous persons who need no repentance
7672737 already you have all you want already you have become rich without us you have become kings and would that you did reign so that we might share the rule with you
7672738 15 and when he had come to the king the king said to him
7672739 go up and triumph the lord will give it into the hand of the king
7672740 men are perishing and if it be unpolite to tell them so it can only be so where the devil is the master of the ceremonies out upon your soul destroying politeness the lord give us a little honest love to souls and this superficial gentility will soon vanish i could with considerable refreshment to myself pour sarcasm after sarcasm upon religious cowardice i would cheerfully sharpen my knife and dash it into the heart of this mean vice there is nothing to be said in its favor it is not even humble it is only pride of too beggarly a sort to own itself
7672741 barack obamas selection of joe biden as his vice presidential running mate is an excellent choice
7672742 joe has been chairman of two major senate committees and has extensive foreign policy background he has a record of bipartisanship which is desperately needed in washington today and would work well with both parties in congress with his background and experience joe would be more than capable of fulfilling the duties of president
7672743 his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america

7672753 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
7672754 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves
7672755 la construction de colonies isra liennes est un probl me
7672756 i am proud to be associated with you i think you did better than anyone could have because of your standing your reputation and your integrity
7672757 i want to see the president of the united states succeed in iraq his success is americas success and his failure is americas failure
7672758 this disconnect i believe is fueling cynicism that is undermining the single most important weapon we need to give our troops to be able to do their job and that is the unyielding support of the american people that support is waning

7672761 biden has carved out a niche as the democratic presidential candidate most willing to publicly rebuke antiwar sentiment
7672762 that there is any possibility in the lifetime of anyone here of having the iraqis get together have a unity government in baghdad that pulls the country together that will not happen it will not happen in the lifetime of anyone here
7672763 acceptable perhaps even satisfying conclusion to the great veep search
7672764 when biden went after john mccain with a vigor and yes a venom that has been missing from obamas stump speaking it was a tonic for the troops who have been waiting for a campaign that is more prepared to throw punches than take them
7672765 the revolution may not be televised but it will be up loaded
7672766 i introduced the terrorism bill in 94 that had a lot of these things in it

7672771 insto a los l deres rusos a que cumplan sus compromisos y no reconozcan estas regiones separatistas
7672772 rusia tiene que respetar la independencia territorial y la soberan a de georgia
7672773 alarmados por las informaciones sobre los planes de rusia de reconocer a abjazia y osetia del sur
7672774 el estatus de esas dos regiones de georgia no es un asunto a decidir por ning n pa s es un asunto para la comunidad internacional mediante los mecanismo en naciones unidas
7672775 hoy es un d a hist rico para abjazia y osetia del sur
7672776 respalda plenamente la pol tica del presidente de rusia hacia osetia del sur y abjasia

7672778 but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances
7672779 hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7672780 we are led by a very talented person in brendan nelson who has my full support who i believe is doing a great job and will lead us to the next federal election
7672781 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7672782 anyone whos had a child knows that that first few days after birth can be very difficult imagine how hard it would be if you have to keep moving to avoid the police just to do what you think is best to protect your child

7672784 weve heard the criticism from across the country including representatives from the medical community that mr epps bill could be interpreted as instilling fetal right
7672785 this bill will be very clear and straightforward and the bill will not be misinterpreted
7672786 weve heard criticism from across the country including representatives of the medical community that mr epps bill as prese ntly drafted could be interpreted as instilling fetal rights let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion
7672787 we have been under the threat of an election for at least the last two years from mr dion
7672788 we are not going to give him a blank cheque
7672789 the conservatives have never said that what their agenda is what is that they want to do
7672790 im a registered democrat but i will be voting for mccain
7672791 hes an african american im a black american i came up through slavery he only read about my history he doesnt really know me
7672792 become a cluster of special interest groups and has now become a party of white elitists and african americans
7672793 several said they are scared i dont know what to do if i vote for hillary im going to get into trouble that is america
7672794 we are here to be a presence for every democrat in the united states so that democracy happens so that the rollcall occurs that it occurs in public
7672795 ive never heard him obama say we need to be one i have heard him say you have to come over here its an order you have to do this
7672796 its time for us to be heard if we have the leverage why take a pass
7672797 we have been working hard in this party we have every reason to claim this territory
7672798 joder macho os est is recorriendo toda la costa eh

7672802 it should come as no surprise that a large majority of americans perceive senator obama as receiving more favorable media treatment compared to senator mccain obama is a fresh young and charismatic political figure any politician who is routinely compared to john f kennedy and bobby kennedy as obama has been will surely cultivate support among journalists this will change however once the nominating conventions are over and the general election campaign begins the euphoria will subside and we are likely to see more balanced coverage
7672803 when just 6 3 of those surveyed were unsure about the balance of media coverage for the candidates its a good indication it is obvious to americans but maybe not to the national media
7672804 more than two fifths 44 8 told our researchers that they would be very or somewhat likely to support a strong third party candidate if one emerged this has to be unsettling to both candidates
7672805 with respect to the poll concerning support for third parties it is not at all unusual to find a substantial portion of the electorate indicating displeasure with the nominees of the two major parties and a willingness to vote for a third party candidate this is a fairly typical finding
7672806 however when given the opportunity to actually vote for a third party candidate the vast majority of these disenchanted respondents will balk at the opportunity and cast their vote for either the democratic or republican candidate a good number of those persons polled who supported none of the above will also vote for one of the two major party candidates the united states has been a two party system since the beginning of the republic and this will not change any time soon

7672820 i feel a hell of a lot better than i did
7672821 it is amazing how quickly you can turn things around
7672822 even though i apologised there were still people questioning me
7672823 that hurt quite a lot those things do not go away all my life i wanted to play cricket for england and it was getting to the point where i was going to lose my test place and something had to give
7672824 it was taking my test form away i never had massive ambitions for the one day captaincy but i thought it was a great time to take on a new challenge
7672825 i told my missus the night before that i was going and there was no way back after that
7672826 but the timing worked out wonderfully for me because i didnt have to front up on the sunday after we lost vaughany came up to me and said im off and i said s thats both of us then i swear it was 100 per cent coincidence

7672831 faraz was a year senior to me when i joined the islamia college peshawar in 1954 he was remarkably handsome full of life but very much into poetry he would gather students around him and read out his mostly romantic poems there was no open mixing of male and female students in those days but somehow his poems managed to reach girl students who felt greatly attracted to him he would receive dozens of hand written letters from them not only those at the university but from a womens college in the city as well the well to do ones would have their servants deliver their letters while others would drop them in front of faraz at bus stops at that time he loved to watch hockey and would lead slogans at the annual match between the two old rivals islamia college and edwards collge
7672832 i am against dictatorship and military rule the time has not yet arrived when i should escape from the country out of fear i will stay home and fight
7672833 what weve seen in the press about michelle has been a complete distortion of the michelle obama i know
7672834 now she has 15 20 minutes to really describe from her heart her family her roots desires how she was raised it will be a very revealing speech it gives the american people a chance to hear her story
7672835 one of the things i talk about when im out campaigning is that my story is not particularly special
7672836 i am a product of chicago public schools and a blue collar household where i was taught the value of hard work responsibility and staying focused on my dreams and goals even if it meant overcoming obstacles the same goes for barack
7672837 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
7672838 america has never considered the possibility of a young smart black woman as first lady
7672839 she needs to show that shes a real human being who shares all the hopes and aspirations of all americans that she wants to give something back to the nation she has to pour her heart out
7672840 if she showed up naked at my door with a pizza
7672841 our studies in mice showed that we could selectively kill the defective autoimmune cells that were destroying insulin producing islets
7672842 these results show that the same selective destruction can occur in human cells and connect what we saw in our animal studies with the protocol we are pursuing in our phase i clinical trial
7672843 evidence is still required as to how long this is effective as a treatment in humans and we look forward to seeing the next stage of trials
7672844 in ancient china doctors added gold flake to drinks for its reputed health benefits and it is still widely used in some aspects of indian ayurvedic medicine
7672845 intramuscular gold injections are sometimes used to treat patients because they can reduce swelling stiffness and pain
7672846 this improved accuracy allows for a more precise radiation dose and a more targeted area for radiotherapy
7672847 these very potent anti cancer drugs are being attached to gold particles which then preferentially locate to a tumour in the body
7672848 it is highly focused so whereas normal chemotherapy would kill healthy cells as well as the diseased ones this method targets just the cancerous cells
7672849 several types of frequently used chemotherapy drugs are derived from platinum
7672850 our scientists helped develop the platinum based drugs carboplatin and cisplatin two of the most successful anti cancer treatments for lung testicular ovarian and head and neck cancer
7672851 now it is being introduced to hundreds of uk hospitals including university college london hospital uclh birmingham hospital and the royal orthopaedic hospital
7672852 many hospitals are already using them so when you open a door or use a hand dryer it could well have reduced levels of bacteria and a lower risk of contamination
7672853 we have no need to consume it in the diet
7672854 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7672855 we think it is self rewarding in the sense that the animals get something positive out of doing this
7672856 the only way to explain why you would feel good about doing something for somebody else is if you have some sort of stake in their welfare and thats really what the empathy mechanism is all about
7672857 we ranked first in sales in the first quarter of 2008 but we couldnt get enough cars in the second quarter thats why we are second
7672858 how much did the clerk get fore rubber stamping this application
7672859 not everyone could get slated by the cook county democratic machine the way barack obama was on several occasions when he was an illinois politician
7672860 is sponsored by the political organization that epitomizes one party rule in this country the cook county democratic machine run by richard daley
7672861 doesnt allow people to run just because they feel like it
7672862 barack obama never took a position on the big box minimum wage bill because thats not something that would have pleased his political sponsor who is mayor daley
7672863 so far obama has outraised john mccain among employees of hedge funds 822 000 to 348 000 this although john mccain wants to leave the capital gains rate at 15 percent and opposes treating hedge fund partner income as personal income
7672864 just a few raindrops on a scorched earth of class bias

7672888 you sort of feel that at least you can then go and say to the family i was there i held his hand
7672889 it means a lot knowing that i had actually been part of that team from the very start to the very finish that we had done everything we possibly could to save him
7672890 but because were volunteers its not something were confronted with every day

7672895 its very very very difficult if not impossible to pinpoint a cause
7672896 i dont know how important that is to consumers i think our perspective is whats more important is we let them know whats going on and we take swift and conservative action to safeguard their health

7672906 any new owner had 28 days after that time to make application for a transfer for the licence and no one made that application
7672907 we advised that if they continued to trade theyd commit an offence every time they sold a beer
7672908 there has been a bit of a misunderstanding in that they believed that when taking over the business there has been a transfer of the licence
7672909 it is a wake up call to a lot of licensees to ensure that what they are doing is in line with the legislation

7672941 the man who walks with god always gets to his destination if you have a pulse you have a purpose the muslim religion is the fastest growing religion per capita in the united states especially in the minority races last month i attended my annual training session thats required for maintaining my state prison security clearance during the training session there was a presentation by three speakers representing the roman catholic protestant and muslim faiths who explained each of their beliefs i was particularly interested in what the islamic imam had to say the imam gave a great presentation of the basics of islam complete with a video after the presentations time was provided for questions and answers when it was my turn i directed my question to the imam and asked please correct me if im wrong but i understand that most imams and clerics of islam have declared a holy jihad holy war against the infidels of the world and that by killing an infidel which is a command to all muslims they are assured of a place in heaven if thats the case can you give me the definition of an infidel there was no disagreement with my statements and without hesitation he replied non believers i responded so let me make sure i have this straight all followers of allah have been commanded to kill everyone who is not of your faith so they can have a place in heaven is that correct the expression on his face changed from one of authority and command to that of a little boy who had just been caught with his hand in the cookie jar he sheepishly replied yes i then stated well sir i have a real problem trying to imagine pope john paul commanding all catholics to kill those of your faith or dr stanley ordering all protestants to do the same in order to guarantee them a place in heaven the imam was speechless i continued i also have problem with being your friend when you and your brother clerics are telling your followers to kill me let me ask you a question would you rather have your allah who tells you to kill me in order for you to go to heaven or my jesus who tells me to love you because i am going to heaven and he wants you to be there with me you could have heard a pin drop as the imam hung his head in shame needless to say the organizers and or promoters of the diversification training seminar were not happy with ricks way of dealing with the islamic imam and exposing the truth about the muslims beliefs in twenty years there will be enough muslim voters in the u s to elect the president i think everyone in the u s should be required to read this but with aclu there is no way this will be widely publicized unless each of us send it on
7672942 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border

7672947 the air force has increased the sheer volume of pilots put through the training pipeline and shipped them off to war with the bare minimum training required
7672948 have come directly from basic training as their first exposure to the professional workforce
7672949 this is stuff we can correct through training stuff that happens between the ears
7672950 flight safety is of paramount importance to the air force and every mishap is carefully studied in order to mitigate future risk
7672951 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7672952 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7672953 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7672954 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7672955 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7672956 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7672957 no i dont want it to slow down my labor again
7672958 no ive got to get her out no time to stop and feel her head
7672959 hes doing great and hes going to sell a lot of records
7672960 just to confirm because i know everyone probably heard and is concerned about him david was not feeling well at the concert last night in houston but you couldnt really tell during his songs we found out yesterday when we were at the buses because one of the handlers told people that david wouldnt be giving hugs because he was feeling sick to his stomach but through all of it david had his usual smile on his face and was as kind and gracious with the crowd as he always is i could tell david was not feeling well during his set his songs sounded wonderful as usual although not the best ive heard him between songs he seemed really exhausted and he was sweating pretty badly throughout the whole thing the amazing thing is that i dont think most people even picked up on it because he sang in his usual incredible way at the afterparty david was pleasant and charming and funny but he confirmed to us that he was indeed not feeling well again i dont think most people would have noticed because he didnt give any overt indication or hint of being under the weather im just hoping that the poor kid gets some much needed rest soon
7672961 im chatting with richard right now david has a cold thats it

7672966 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table

7672968 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7672969 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7672970 success isnt a result of spontaneous combustion you must set yourself on fire
7672971 i was told the thing i wanted to hear that nothing could really make it any worse which is why i wanted to try to pitch through it
7672972 it just hasnt gone away like i thought it would after all the stuff ive tried doing with it
7672973 its frustrating because i want to be here i want to help the team but i think me not being able to 100 percent go out there thats hurting the team a little bit
7672974 when i rested it the first time it did feel a little better
7672975 but once i started going at it pitching it kind of came back
7672976 even without his best stuff he pitched a pretty good game against pittsburgh
7672977 but the bottom line is we just cannot risk his long term health in the midst of this pennant race
7672978 i feel comfortable that well find a way internally to get it done
7672979 im very comfortable with our young prospects coming here and doing it
7672980 i dont like bringing kids up then sending them down for one start
7672981 this would not be for one start if we decided we would go with niese or if it was to be parnell he would be here through september callups
7672982 he has performed well and hopefully weve gotten through the period where he needs a day or so
7672983 hopefully hes at that part of the year where his second wind kicks in and boom
7672984 we dont have in my opinion the luxury or wiggle room to do all the different give you this give you that we are in the fight of our life and weve got to go with whats best

7672987 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
7672988 the oireachtas could ratify lisbon subject to a number of opt outs if necessary for example the charter of fundamental rights the solidarity clause transfer of certain matters to qualified majority voting and the inclusion of new competences such as energy security climate change and tourism
7672989 mep mary lou mcdonald has said if the irish government secures a better deal for ireland at european level only then is there an argument for a new referendum those of us on the no side want specific new additional points in the treaty and we want specific cast iron legal views on taxation she said
7672990 a succession of anti family anti life and other anti christian decisions by brussels has made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive support for europe in the lisbon referendum
7672991 concerns were expressed regarding abortion despite the specific assurances in terms of irelands legal arrangements in this regard
7672992 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
7672993 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
7672994 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
7672995 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
7672996 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
7672997 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
7672998 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
7672999 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
7673000 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt
7673001 as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business
7673002 the refusal is based upon his felony conviction as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business he does not get a waiver to entry despite his conviction as other convicted ira members have
7673003 he could apply again but the likelihood of his being able to enter the states is slim to none given both his record and the political climate
7673004 there is a famous story from seoul in 1988 that there were so many used condoms on the roof terrace of the british teams residential block the night after the swimming concluded that the british olympic association sent out an edict banning outdoor sex here in beijing organisers have realised that such prohibitions are about as useful as banning breathing and have instead handed out thousands of free condoms to the athletes if you cant stop em at least make it safe

7673010 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
7673011 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7673012 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
7673013 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
7673014 comments such as these are clearly part of the pathetic choreography surrounding the so called policing and justice saga members of mr caol ins own party are disenchanted not only by the failure of their leaders to secure the devolution of such powers to stormont but also by their cosy relationship with the dup

7673018 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7673019 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7673020 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7673021 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7673022 last saturday night there was a rocket attack in the middle of lisnaskea co fermanagh in which several police officers were nearly murdered there was no coordinated political response an emergency executive meeting was convened to address floods while the attempted murder of police went unmentioned if there was a rocket attack on garda in dublin city centre on saturday night brian cowen would call an emergency meeting of political and security figures to agree a strategy to deal with the threat while i dont want to over emphasise the dissident threat they are intent on killing police and there could be civilian deaths too
7673023 the psni as a political statement and thus they judge the psnis success not by its effectiveness but by its existence and that sad to say makes the psni the latest in a long line of political police forces here
7673024 i talked to mr blatter about how we could find a solution to this and i am confident fifa will give the assurances that the scottish welsh and irish associations want

7673028 how can you have a great britain football team which includes northern ireland would you therefore support changing the name to team uk
7673029 no country in its right mind would want this pervert at large on its soil
7673030 all we can hope is that wherever he ends up he will be locked away until he ceases to be a threat to children
7673031 you might think if you were attempting to define public service broadcasting for this modern competitive age that your very starting point would be what can we do to help ensure the continuing breadth of tvs appeal
7673032 with no money to spend they see tv as the primary form of entertainment
7673033 the research found one group of 12 people sharing a house who all congregate around the tv

7673107 stresses a personal almost mystical knowledge of god and the workings of the lords inner light within all people
7673108 i heard a voice which said that is the inner voice or
7673109 the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world

7673114 well honey you threw up on puppy and now it needs to go away
7673115 yes baby puppy has to go bye bye but mommy will get you a new puppy
7673116 bryan has been around a number of years now he has been a good defenseman for quite some time
7673117 im excited about bryans willingness to come here on a try out it will certainly pick up the competition level of what is going to take place in training camp anytime you can add a player like him this is kind of an out of the blue thing it just kind of popped up over the last week to 10 days we are looking forward to seeing how he does
7673118 basically my agent tommy laidlaw talked to paul holmgren and thought that this was something that we felt would be a good situation for me to show what i have
7673119 i thank the flyers for giving me this opportunity to try out i am really looking forward to this i have been around for a while training camps are nothing new for me i like to come in and compete at a high level i want to show them that i can play and hopefully make the team and to be able to contribute and help out in any way i can
7673120 bryan is player with a lot of experience and hes had some really good years in the league
7673121 anytime a player of that type of caliber who wants to come and try out it is a good thing i think we will have a competitive camp we have lots of preseason games so he will get the opportunity to play to see where he is at with our team
7673122 i just talked it over with my agent and kind of looked at the scenario that would have been best for me with a two year deal i think it worked out the best for myself and for the flyers
7673123 i think it does when anyone signs a contract the easiest thing to do is to get the deal and the hardest thing to do is to go out and prove that youre worth it and not only that but youre worth more than that thats what its going to take and im definitely excited and cant wait until training camp
7673124 i think weve got a very strong club i think we went out on a high note last year and with the job that homer has done in the last year or two years here has been remarkable thats really changed this organization and this team around and put us back in a competitive zone that philly is normally in i dont think theres anything less in expectations this year of going right to the conference finals and getting past that to the finals its very exciting to be a part of this team
7673125 im extremely excited obviously its an honor to be part of the philadelphia flyers organization for another three years and after coming off of last season were going to have a great team this upcoming season im just excited to be a part of it
7673126 i love philly i love the area i love the organization and i love everything about playing here it was almost like i was born to be a flyer ive been in the organization for four years now and im happy ill be here for at least another three and hopefully longer
7673127 im just as excited as everyone else coming off of a run like that going from 30th to fourth place in one year everyones excited im just training now and trying to improve myself
7673128 i think im ready to go now its up to coaches
7673129 i havent talked to john stevens yet but personally im ready to go tomorrow
7673130 i felt pretty good today and thats why im pretty confident to say im ready to go tomorrow
7673131 right now im just kind of dealing with some things with the eye and stuff like that
7673132 so every day its been getting better tomorrow were reevaluating it again
7673133 yeah i think theres a good chance everything felt pretty good it felt like ive been off the ice for a couple of days and wearing the visor is a little bit of an adjustment as well but its something im going to have to do right now
7673134 kimmo is an elite player in the league hes not just a great player hes one of our leaders to lose a guy like that theyre not easily replaced you need a lot extra from everybody in your lineup just to try to close the gap that was left behind when he was out
7673135 coburn is a big guy plays in all situations creates speed and is a good defender so to get one or both back would be a great lift for us in a lot of ways
7673136 were not going to put anybody back in the lineup if we dont feel theyre ready to play and clearly thats the case right now
7673137 hes a young kid that wants to play hes really kind of distraught right now that hes not able to play
7673138 were hopeful well win this game today and we have a couple of days before we play again and hopefully we can get him back
7673139 we had sami kapanen on the left side and we moved him back over to the right
7673140 now i think hes more comfortable on the right and patricks done some good things as well
7673141 we always try to get better every game that we play and were looking to have our best game of the playoffs tonight
7673142 everything checked out okay the only issue now is the swelling around his eye that is the concern we have right now moving forward everything in and around his eye is fine thats good news
7673143 he will still be listed as doubtful for the game tomorrow
7673144 were still waiting to hear word on how his eye actually is right now its swollen shut there are no fractures and hes doing better
7673145 we have no reason to think that theres anything wrong with the eye itself
7673146 last night our doctors who were at the game thought he was fine but we just wanted him to get checked out by an actual ophthalmologist assuming there are no issues there well just wait for the swelling to go down
7673147 i would say for the game tomorrow hes probably doubtful
7673148 he had no loss of consciousness at the time he was cognizant and aware when flyers trainer jim mccrossin got to him he did have some issues on the plane last night but i think everybody thinks it was due to loss of blood he lost a lot of blood from that injury
7673149 everything checks out were just waiting to hear from the ophthalmologist on the actual eye itself whether theres any issues there we dont suspect there is we just want to get it checked out
7673150 steve downie will play tonight and patrick thoresen will come out
7673151 our fourth line has been big contributors in the playoffs here i think all those guys including patrick have done a great job we just think downie gives us another right hand shot in the lineup hes a competitive guy and he can create a little bit offensively
7673152 there was an article there that i read i dont know who wrote it saying that its been like this for 20 some years now you hear the same thing all over again
7673153 if thats the style they want to play theres rules if they want to keep playing that way then they have to expect to be called i look at the tape from game 3 and they had penalties a lot more than we did but theres a lot of calls that the referee didnt call because i guess he gets tired of calling them
7673154 if i wasnt ready to handle everything i wouldnt be dressing
7673155 its just too important and there are too many guys that we have that are healthy and i wouldnt go out with any limitations on myself
7673156 our power play has been struggling and mikes been a big part of the success weve had
7673157 it was tough to see him go out of the lineup but hed certainly be a welcome addition back in
7673158 umby has been a good player wherever hes been i feel bad for r j because he doesnt have a home on a line but thats what makes him such a valuable player
7673159 whether he plays there or with richie i think youll see good things from him
7673160 theyre one team that shouldnt talk over 82 games they had the most suspensions in the league
7673161 after that goal they should not have been taunting our players
7673162 they should have been happy and went to the bench dont turn around and taunt our players timonen deserved it
7673163 kimmo timonen is as classy a guy as youre going to find in the game of hockey
7673164 i dont see it as taunting the play was dead i think something might have been said to timonen and he looked back over his shoulder and he got popped kimmos one of the quiet guys when he talks its usually to his own teammates timonen is probably the least likely guy thats involved in that part of the game and the thing you love about him is he never shows frustration he always shows composure in his game i think were talking about something that doesnt apply to kimmo timonen
7673165 i just heard kostopoulos yelling something to me and i turned around and the next thing i know i got punched in the face but like i said lets move on now im going to focus on game 3 and hopefully well win
7673166 weve had stretches where lines have worked really well together scottie hartnell has probably played his best hockey with vinny and danny its obviously something were going to look at again
7673167 we had some success in the past it was working pretty good for close to 20 games
7673168 when we were up 3 1 against washington and lost two games johnny juggled the lines and thats how it ended up for the first game in this series we lost last game and our line wasnt that productive
7673169 i dont know if thats the way were going to start game 2 but me scotty and vinny had a lot of success against washington so were hoping that we can reproduce that tonight against montreal
7673170 its no secret that i like to get in there and hit and that will free up some loose pucks for them to make some plays
7673171 im not going to change my game ill do the things i need to do to be effective out there and hopefully they put the puck in the net
7673172 either way we feel like we have good balance up front
7673173 were going to leave the danny briere line with vaclav prospal and scott hartnell the way it was and bring riley cote back in and put him back where he was on his line with jim dowd and sami kapanen
7673174 right now we have joffrey lupul with jeff carter and scottie upshall and patrick thoresen with mike richards and r j umberger
7673175 a couple lines have changed but overall its not an enormous amount of change these guys have all played together and played well during the year and we expect them to fit right in together
7673176 the crowds at home have been just terrific weve had good starts because of it and we come out with all kinds of energy from start to finish the crowd gives us all kinds of energy and thats when we play our best hockey were excited to come home and play in front of our home fans for big game tonight
7673177 there was about four minutes left in the second period mike green had the puck and he was kind of like setting up to shoot i went down maybe i was a little bit too anxious i dont know i changed my mind halfway through it i think my skate got caught and kind of came over my heel and basically my leg was completely straight bent forward and i pulled a hamstring
7673178 no i dont think it was a rut i just kind of caught my heel and went down awkwardly it was just an awkward moment i was just trying to do too much almost instead of just staying on my feet
7673179 individually speaking to go from the excitement of the game before to hurting yourself the next game where you are facing the fact that you might be done for the series thats pretty disheartening you feel bad as an individual and you feel bad as a teammate now you have to watch the guys go out and try and win and you cant do anything to help the way scottie upshall and jeff carter and i have been playing so hard and so well i guess hopefully it is a chance for somebody else to step up and seize the moment and step in with scott and jeff and help us finish up the series
7673180 yesterday morning the miracle happened and it was just unbelievable theres so much emotion and all that and you cant be thankful enough it was just a great moment
7673181 i feel real good its under my assumption that im playing
7673182 i know that the pace will be very fast and very high with a lot of intensity i just have to go out there and keep it simple
7673183 he skated yesterday for quite a length of time and felt good
7673184 it will be a game time decision with him but hell take warm ups and then well decide from that point if hes going to play or not
7673185 he was playing his best hockey at the end of the year so if we could get him back in that would be a big boost for us
7673186 i think his competitive nature would take over and hell step right in and be a good player
7673187 it felt pretty good today and it felt good sunday
7673188 its actually amazing im actually smiling after coming off the ice
7673189 i am glad that the testing went as it went it did not show anything on the ultrasound my groin area is sore and swollen i cant really walk properly right now it hurts
7673190 oh yes i consider myself very lucky the puck could have hit me worse in that midsection area or hit me in the face was lucky in an unlucky situation
7673191 the chance is there because there is nothing wrong right now its just a matter of pain right now it doesnt feel like i am ready to go because i am very sore but i will keep icing the area today and keep trying to get the swelling down and we will see how i feel tomorrow
7673192 yes he actually contacted jim mccrossin our medical trainer and left a nice message for me he wished me well and said he hoped everything will be okay with me that was very classy of him that is what the game is all about i really appreciated that
7673193 the ultrasound they did last night was actually good news
7673194 they did another ultrasound this morning and everything checked out okay hes now back at the hotel just resting up as far as his status its going to come down to how he feels but hes a possibility for the game tomorrow
7673195 obviously were all thankful its not more serious than it is
7673196 we expect smith and jonesy to play but those will be concrete decisions at game time
7673197 i felt good out there today and i actually felt good yesterday
7673198 i went out and skated on my own before anybody was here so it was just another day to recharge
7673199 it was a critical time we where at the point were we needed to play well get points and win games or our season probably would have been over
7673200 i think the last bunch of games we played more start to finish in every game thats what you need and its a great time to come together as a team
7673201 the good thing is we still have three more days to go before the first game right now i believe ill be in right from the get go
7673202 when you dont play and youre a healthy scratch you try and refocus
7673203 i told myself be ready to play when the opportunity comes again
7673204 danny briere is still day to day with the lower body injury jason smith is day to day with an upper body injury and sami kapanen is day to day with neck and sinus related issues
7673205 for the most part considering everything i feel good but right now its somewhat of a battle i havent been able to do a lot for the last three weeks and the last three or four weeks weve been doing a ton im just trying to get over some of the soreness and stiffness
7673206 i would love to get out there as soon as possible only time will tell its just how things respond here i think well see how i feel tomorrow and see if i skate with the team tomorrow or not i anticipate definitely skating with the team soon
7673207 we have done some things this morning we still dont know it is going to depend on how it goes this afternoon i will show up at the game and get ready and see if we can make it work for tonight we are just not sure yet
7673208 i am hoping i can go but a lot of it depends on what happens later today it is frustrating thats why i want to be out there i want to help out the team we all are aware of the situation but sometimes there is just nothing you can do i am hoping i will be on the ice tonight and be able to help my teammates
7673209 it is just a charlie horse kind of thing i tried to go inside and ruutu just stuck his leg there
7673210 id have to see the replay i dont know if that was a dirty play or not but hes known as a dirty player if i would have seen him or known it was him i probably would have protected myself better
7673211 there remains the further step of realizing our own individual participation in the unfolding story especially in its creative and sacred dimensions
7673212 mclaren is also associated with later in the same article dr coehlo futher illuminates us about this spiritual journey that began with her own quaker roots there was the small quaker meeting three miles from our farm attended by all three generations of my family we went every sunday to this day almost fifty years since i left home i could tell you the names of the regulars where they usually sat and whether or not they were among those who were often moved to speak miss rushmore spoke every sunday from near the front on the left i remember fondly too picnics on the meeting grounds and especially community picnics at the taylors farm on the delaware river the grade school run by the meeting provided a secure home for this vulnerable child the seed of god the indwelling christ within a dynamic center a creative life that presses to birth within us

7673223 it was just sad because we had some people who drove up from albany and from the state college area but everyone was very congenial
7673224 theyre the lifeblood of our tournament so we wanted to do whatever we could do to appease them today because it wasnt anyones fault

7673228 i have never experienced a situation like this being two months without kicking a ball i just want to be fully recovered
7673229 i am not used to being sidelined i feel sad but the worst moment has already gone and i recognise that i must patient
7673230 i feel well and the time of kicking a ball is coming playing football this is what makes me happy
7673231 ive met the girls on the team and i love them all
7673232 they laid it out how id develop over the four years
7673233 they talked about how much of a family penn state is
7673234 they all spoke highly of coach washington and that pretty much sealed the deal for me

7673297 ive talked to adam and i recognize the anger the notion that someone is getting preferential treatment because theyre an officeholder is an infuriating concept
7673298 he was a human being acting as a human being and he acted outside of the structure it was mistake he shouldnt have done it and he recognized that he apologized to me and to the citizens of this community
7673299 for you to come here and ask me if im abusing my power when my house is swimming in the water is crazy i am prepared to pay for any services i receive just like any other citizen
7673300 he made a mistake he erred on the side of being compassionate and caring we went outside of our structure as a result of that we had a conversation about it and im confident it will never happen again
7673301 i recognize that adam took that call from someone he knew personally a colleague of his and he was moved by it and hes a problem solver hes probably one of our top problem solvers he saw a person in desperate need of help and he responded outside the chain of command which he should not have done
7673302 the challenge is we had to assess the need versus the availability thats what chief marty senterfitt does as the leader of the eoc he takes all the info in they dont have a lot of time the system works well when you go through it and thats why were here because someone went outside the system and it was a mistake
7673303 i called the eoc talked to sherry hall our contact person
7673304 this just reeks of what they do in washington and she comes back here to jacksonville
7673305 they think theyre politicians they can ask for anything and they can get it where we ask and we dont get it
7673306 adam would do that for any call he received but not a lot of people have a way to call him directly some people did and the rest is history in the heat of battle when youre trying to save property and potentially lives i think he did the best he could at the time

7673400 ahora puedo decir que existe una esperanza para esta vituperada ciencia en argentina
7673401 but this wont dent my commitment to the sport i think i need to surround myself with some more motivated athletes and the marathon is always in the back of my mind but i just dont know if my body can handle that kind of training i cant just say im done with the track though
7673402 i know i spoke quite emotionally after the heats but i wasnt trying to point fingers
7673403 it shouldnt be a matter of finding a weakness in someone like derval orourke or david gillick it should be a matter of finding the strength to tell youngsters that this is what you can become i know david at 15 had no dream of coming to the olympics and yet he made it
7673404 i dont think were attracting enough youngsters to the sport they all want to play rugby or soccer the talent is there but the pool is shrunk all the time and thats part of my frustration because the more we get stripped apart the less appealing this sport becomes to youngsters and the more desperate people become for success the worse the stripping gets were just falling into a downhill spiral
7673405 each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey
7673406 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7673407 but each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey i come here tonight as a sister blessed with a brother who is my mentor my protector and my lifelong friend i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion and her intelligence reflected in my own daughters
7673408 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them

7673439 it just started raining and it didnt want to stop
7673440 weve lost 50 percent of the crop we knew we were going to get a little rain but we didnt know we were going to get all this wind and rain together
7673441 if we dont dry out the cotton is going to be impacted a lot more than it is right now
7673442 it will not end the drought it will make a dent
7673443 were monitoring the track of gustav and reviewing our destructive weather plans and procedures
7673444 im just going to stay in my house and watch out for it
7673445 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7673446 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7673447 any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position and continues to be our position
7673448 there is no agreement until there is an agreement signed
7673449 optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals
7673450 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7673451 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7673452 grey days and grey streets if this city had a name it would be defeat
7673453 tendency is to shoot first and to ask questions later
7673454 cheer led president george w bushs decision to take our eye off the ball and start a war in iraq that had nothing to do with 9 11
7673455 this is a record that belies anything approaching sound judgment
7673456 yes it hurts like fuck but you would be surprised how freeing it is to get punched in the face
7673457 we are honored nasa selected the lifepak 1000 defibrillator to protect the lives of crew members onboard the international space station
7673458 the 1000 is used by thousands of emergency responders worldwide and was designed for use in the harshest environments and situations its proven to be one of the most reliable products physio control has ever developed this space first is especially exciting for us as it underscores the many reasons customers choose lifepak defibrillators for emergency medical use
7673459 when we say the democratic government it caters for all the social ills and evils and it means that the prices of commodities will be justified equal opportunities will be offered to the masses without the differences of color creed and caste the democracy means the transparency in the governance and the participation of the populace it means the respect and regard for everyone and the rule of people by the people on the people
7673460 after this cut of date the horizon is opening for the nation though the time is tough and the path is bumpy but the country will start to progress in fields of rule of law economic growth reinstatement of judiciary stability of institution amp supremacy of parliament peace on western border equality of relationship with other countries and last but not the least fleeing of dictatorship
7673461 the picture seems crystal clear and a fish is out of water
7673462 the main reason given for lifting the ban is that the general public is much more outspoken and broadminded than it was and that to ventilate vice and its tragedies would be to the general social advantage
7673463 the subject will be very distasteful and embarrassing in mixed company of all ages and also that the introduction in plays of new vices might start an unfortunate train of thought in the previously innocent
7673464 for some time the subject of homosexuality has been so widely debated written about that it is no longer justifiable to continue the strict exclusion of this subject from the stage
7673465 we would not pass a play that was violently pro homosexual
7673466 we would not allow funny innuendo or jokes on the subject
7673467 we will not allow embraces between males of practical demonstrations of love
7673468 we will allow the word pansy but not the word bugger
7673469 in terms of censorship of representations of homosexuality it became almost a mania it was as much about latching on to one example of the new permissiveness that developed in the postwar years and seeing in it all the ills of a new world that the retired air force colonels found it hard to understand and instinctively opposed
7673470 it was a time of change but often incremental change and of compromises between old and new guard the old guard was more tenacious than might have been supposed and the new guard was prepared to work within existing systems as well as blazing new ground
7673471 as requested the line worn out but still a few good pumps in her will be omitted
7673472 ive read it and i think its revolting quite apart from the homosexual bits to me it has no saving grace whatsoever if we pass muck like this it does underlined give our critics something to go on
7673473 throughout there runs a rare vitality and with experience and greater conciseness one feels mr pinter may well make some impact as a dramatist
7673474 cannot understand why the younger generation instead of knocking on the door should bash the fuck out of it
7673475 it was as if the theatre were being censored by disgusted of tunbridge wells
7673476 the legendary song writer and producer desmond child introduced the idea to us we wanted to make a new album with the band that is more mature and not so much songs where girls are chasing boys or boys are chasing girls something deep this is a time to turn back around to find the road to humanity to find love and respect for each other in this world it is one thing to play rock you like a hurricane and to have fun theres nothing wrong with that but there is so much more to it so many parts of the world where we played we had the feeling that music can build bridges and make connections with people
7673477 when we watch the news every night on the tv that is reality in the world of music we live in the world of emotions music can create a feeling and so what we try to do is to send out positive vibes in the world we hope through music we can change but a song cannot change the world it is not a rock revolution anymore those days are over it is not the 60s anymore
7673478 obviously the technology is this advanced so you have to live with what there is once something is free people dont understand why they have to pay for it again which i can understand also but in the end you are destroying the basis for the artist to make music
7673479 as usual it took a year of adventures in life and relationships to put my innermost feelings into the shape of songs everything is straight from inside of my head compositions and lyrics are supposed to support each other as good as possible to express my innermost emotions
7673480 on one hand there is going to be some really melodic songs and on the other hand the heavy stuff is heavier than anything we have ever done before still you wont need to be afraid of dramatic changes itll be the typical
7673481 permanent joy for all of the little the democratic party that meets today in denver is one that many of its forebears would hardly recognize and might abhor
7673482 if you are a weak government and this government is now much weaker your ability to take unpopular decisions is further reduced
7673483 from the war on terror perspective this is a very bad development
7673484 i have decided to part ways with mr zardari to go out of the alliance
7673485 or rather i would say we have been forced to make this decision
7673486 under the new system no low skilled migrants will be allowed into the uk from outside the eu that is a large amount of people who are being written off but who add a huge amount to the diversity of an area and local economy
7673487 were also worried that the system is based on a short term economic analysis of what migrants bring to a country a migrant may be entrepreneurial once they have arrived in this country ie they create a skill we just dont know
7673488 migrant labour is by no means the only solution to our tight labour market the national skills strategy was launched to address the needs of our domestic labour force
7673489 our studies in mice showed that we could selectively kill the defective autoimmune cells that were destroying insulin producing islets
7673490 these results show that the same selective destruction can occur in human cells and connect what we saw in our animal studies with the protocol we are pursuing in our phase i clinical trial
7673491 evidence is still required as to how long this is effective as a treatment in humans and we look forward to seeing the next stage of trials
7673492 aq is not the only extremist ideology of interest or concern domestically or overseas but countering the aq threat is a counterterrorism priority and requires aq centric communications efforts
7673493 it the narrative combines fact fiction emotion and religion and manipulates discontent about local and international issues the narrative is simple flexible and infinitely accommodating it can be adapted to suit local conditions and may have a disproportionate influence on understanding and interpretation of local or global events
7673494 the objective is not to dismiss grievances but undermine aqs position as their champion and violent extremism as the solution
7673495 our first tailored product with key arguments exposing the theme aq is losing support
7673496 this series of guidance alone will not fatally undermine the aq narrative but it can increase our impact against the narrative while we develop a bespoke and hard hitting campaign using private sector resources
7673497 we are in negotiations with several major communications companies to design and deliver high impact campaigns across media and non media channels
7673498 push these message themes to a wide range of contacts
7673499 if it looks too much like government propaganda then i dont think people are going to listen nor should they
7673500 i blame myself for not saving mohammed but where i come from we are not used to this kind of thing happening at home we never need to defend ourselves like that
7673501 after i asked them to leave i noticed a police car pull up outside so i went over and spoke to the officers i asked them to keep an eye on the boys and they said they would then left less than an hour later mohammed who was like a brother to everyone here had been beaten the attack was completely unprovoked and without reason
7673502 this incident will be disastrous for britains relationship with the united arab emirates what parent will want to send their children here for the summer when they know things like this are happening
7673503 we are all deeply shocked at whats happened mohammed was everyones friend we cannot believe something like this could happen we will never come back here
7673504 the young man was a visitor to hastings and his death is tragic our thoughts are with his family
7673505 the commission does not take these actions if it does not intend to penalise the country concerned it could be the beginning of the end of these laws
7673506 they took almost 75 of our land and gave us some other land that was worthless
7673507 there is now a bathroom fittings shop where our house was
7673508 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq leadership and supporters and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
7673509 they are not heroes and dont have answers and that they harm you your country and your livelihood
7673510 it is aimed primarily but not exclusively at those working with overseas influencers and opinion formers
7673511 use advisedly avoid suggesting that aq is no longer a threat we are not claiming victory over aq we are stressing their declining support
7673512 on the defensive throughout much of the rest of the world
7673513 feed its new franchises with propaganda to keep the brand alive at all costs
7673514 on how best to tailor such material for media engagements presenting information to ministers or to other stakeholders it is in a separate unclassified format to make it the sort of product that a minister or a press officer could use before an interview or that could be given as a crib sheet for trusted contacts
7673515 mi5 has concluded that there is no easy way to identify those who become involved in terrorism in britain
7673516 a unique insight into current thinking within the security service about how a modern day terrorist is made
7673517 based on hundreds of case studies of those involved in or closely associated with terrorism
7673518 we should never overstate the menace we face from violent extremism
7673519 entirely acceptable and indeed necessary for academics to seek to understand and explain what motivates violent extremists
7673520 i just thought that the handprint was one of the most dignified images that i could find the most simple image of innocence absorbed in all that pain
7673521 have huge tv sets state of the art mobile phones cars and get drunk in pubs at the weekend
7673522 roast beef and yorkshire pudding is heaven provided you dont overcook the sprouts
7673523 foreign dishes out of little bits of nothing at all
7673524 so delicious so unconstipating so digestible so full of glorious garlic
7673525 superbly produced and unbelievably terrible but i feel i have to learn all about it i wish everyone else did then perhaps there would never be another war fat chance
7673526 the number of arrests is up on last year but that is predominantly because of proactive policing
7673527 the message is that there is no place for knives at the carnival
7673528 we share the concern of londoners over the recent spate of knife crime and we are doing all we can to combat that
7673529 hey lets ask the college activity director to give us the auditorium to play in for oh i dont know new years
7673530 hey let me build my base and see how well you do against my pretty defenses
7673531 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is the british government in london
7673532 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7673533 such language as has been used by this sinn f in representative begins to cast significant doubt on sinn f ins commitment to making progress in stormont
7673534 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7673535 it is fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7673536 some people have said it is as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal with in the 1970s
7673537 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities
7673538 it has been very much ebb and flow and the mood here is very much one of financial caution as regards next year we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7673539 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year
7673540 one would hope that the conditions in credit markets should gradually start to improve and those two factors will help to ensure growth will start to pick up as we go through next year
7673541 its a sad indictment of our broken society that so many are turning to things like drug and alcohol abuse at such a young age
7673542 its called gang war he wasnt in a gang himself but he got caught up in something that was going on he was in between something
7673543 he never started any trouble he wasnt a follower he was a leader and he always tried to tell everyone the right things to do he had just passed his college exams out of everyone i know he was doing well with his life
7673544 what has happened was completely unpredictable because he doesnt cause trouble and obviously the trouble has come to him he had loads of friends and he was really popular
7673545 thats all the bedrooms bathrooms living room kitchen and florida room area
7673546 i think its horrible i feel sorry for the families here on the beach a lot of them have put a lot of money into blockades right here you can see a home eaten away to the foundation
7673547 category three hurricane is in and out this tropical storm fay stayed here for what two two and a half three days
7673548 we had twenty foot seas waves breaking over the end of the pier so it stayed for a couple of days and it did its damage
7673549 the boards we knew they would pop up and blow away which is what theyre supposed to do
7673550 the boards are built designed so that we just slip em back in where they go
7673551 most amazing thing to me is that 6 000 pound piece of concrete got moved and damaged
7673552 its pretty sad id rather be out there points to piers end its a lot cooler and hopefully more fish out there
7673553 but the concrete getting moved thats amazing to me i cant fathom that but thats some strong water and some strong winds

7673555 each time i play a grand slam i always think that oh this could be my last time playing here
7673556 ive obviously learned that i have no idea what the future holds and what will happen and i dont make decisions for the future any more from this day that im living in
7673557 its really very hard not to think about the olympic games
7673558 its very difficult to refocus and just to get ready for the open
7673559 to some people who knew some things about his r sum
7673560 hes young he speaks well and hes a great performer
7673561 to some people who knew some things about his r sum
7673562 y ouve told me that a lot of the kids your age love barack obama they just dont know anything about barack obama
7673563 so as that fat increases the insulin in the body just isnt strong enough to work against it and the person gets diabetes
7673564 it had the most powerful anti diabetic effect id ever seen
7673565 while restrained eaters may be attracted to smaller foods in smaller packages initially presumably because these products are thought to help consumers with their diets our research shows that restrained eaters actually tend to consume more of these foods than they would of regular foods
7673566 really the safest thing you can do is make all your food at home from scratch period
7673567 sometimes we buy the product anyway and sometimes we dont
7673568 what does this really mean can i count on it as a consumer to really have any meaning
7673569 advisory labeling may not be protecting the health of allergic consumers
7673570 not suitable for consumption by persons with an allergy to x
7673571 maybe illustrates how difficult it can be when you have food allergies to stay on top of that information
7673572 what im most proud of in my entire career is the violence against women act
7673573 a survey by the institute of cancer research found that men knew more about breast cancer than about prostate cancer
7673574 if one is to accept the basic principles of equality that feminism advances then one must accept that women like men are capable of the entire range of human action and experience from the summits of artistic creativity and human compassion to the depths of debased violence and evil
7673575 the woman who falsely accused three duke university lacrosse players of raping her is coming out with a memoir in early october according to a news release on thursday the last dance for grace the crystal mangum story is the only definitive account of the life and struggles of the woman at the center of the duke lacrosse case the alleged accuser says a release from fire products inc the film studio that is representing her cooper never pursued a case against mangum saying she likely believed her allegations
7673576 magnum a divorced mother of three will donate 1 from the purchase of each book to help battered women
7673577 it seemed like a perfect example of our clubs theme this year
7673578 all ten rooms at the house were occupied each by a family with a desperate need being filled by the facility and its staff
7673579 even with weary smiles on their faces there was little doubt that our hard work was greatly appreciated by the families
7673580 each of us is looking forward to next months meal
7673581 a lot of people are with the wrong people for the wrong reasons
7673582 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
7673583 show the desperate level al qaida has reached with members of one family driving each other to death
7673584 i swear to allah that i do not know them they were strangers
7673585 no no they put it on me and told me to take it off at home
7673586 la primera tarea de la educaci n es agitar la vida pero dejarla libre para que se desarrolle
7673587 la educaci n es algo admirable sin embargo es bueno recordar que nada que valga la pena se puede ense ar
7673588 dead on par with where 95 of america would like it to be
7673589 we built a giant wishlist of features we wanted to add based on the opinions of our team and original samba players
7673590 we then worked with sega to determine which features would be the best for the game and came up with a list that felt good
7673591 we had people constantly playing the game from the moment it was up and running on the wii
7673592 to gauge the opinions about the wii version we created playtesting sessions that included folks who had played the original games only a few times alongside hardcore samba fans that had mastered the original using the data from these different types of players we were able to make sure the game felt rock solid for the new player and hardcore samba fan alike
7673593 its a sad indictment of our broken society that so many teenagers are turning to things like drugs and alcohol abuse at such a young age the government needs to take action now
7673594 the true toll on teenagers lives is far higher we must do more to tackle the wider causes of social breakdown that means we need to strengthen families radically reform the welfare system and provide more good school places
7673595 its been crazy for the last few days im just looking forward to sleeping in my own bed im certainly going to continue on to london in 2012 i want to focus on my sport its going to be exciting its going to be fun and i just need to get the balance right to make sure theres enough commitment to my sport anything else goes in around that
7673596 we were just sitting back chilling sipping the champers it was wicked
7673597 no one expected this level of reception but today the focus should be on the athletes for me its been a huge privilege to lead such a close knit motivated and successful team i hope that many of these athletes will be with us at the greatest moment in british sport when we host the games in london in 2012
7673598 its a historic day the best results for team gb for 100 years the whole team is very grateful to the british public who have been absolutely magnificent in their enthusiasm and commitment in supporting the team
7673599 obviously i had my expectations but it wasnt two gold medals at all its been fantastic
7673600 i just hope shes not overwhelmed by it all but i dont think she will be for one second i think shell just enjoy it
7673601 shes so focused so dedicated but more importantly she loves what she does i think shell get back in the pool as soon as she can
7673602 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct
7673603 technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced but more in terms of different
7673604 after many years of learning how to do it we did a number of analyses of efficiency and found that neanderthal tools are no less efficient and indeed in some respects were more efficient than the tools of homo sapiens
7673605 it was only by spending three years in the lab learning how to make these tools that we were able to finally replicate them accurately enough to come up with our findings
7673606 colonising a continent isnt easy colonising a continent during the ice age is even harder so for early homo sapiens colonising ice age europe a new shared and flashy looking technology might serve as one form of social glue by which larger social networks were bonded
7673607 the allegations concerned her too so its appropriate and she has always been very supportive
7673608 even leonard cohen lets us take a couple and if there is anyone in the world who doesnt need the publicity its got to be him they are being divas
7673609 what sort of sad idiot watches someone eat then phones a newspaper
7673610 people hate wearing them because they fit terribly and feel strange
7673611 you end up looking like an out of date parent
7673612 that marbling effect is the spores inside once a truffle is ripe it lets off a lovely smell
7673613 we sell as many as we can get out of the ground at the moment
7673614 we have now got about nine large plantations across the south of england
7673615 it takes a long time for a plantation to start producing once it has been infected with the fungi you usually have to wait for between eight and 10 years
7673616 the man and his van is always a bit of a fear
7673617 i guess once we start producing people will know who we are but id like to keep a low profile until then
7673618 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7673619 the worst thing you can be in this industry is a middle class white male if any middle class white male i come across says he wants to enter television i say give up all hope theyve no chance
7673620 i feel awfully sorry for white middle class men who went to oxbridge but im not sure they are the ones at the greatest disadvantage
7673621 obviously the people who really are facing the biggest struggle to make it into television are those from working class backgrounds and people from ethnic minorities if they are both working class and from an ethnic minority they really are up against it
7673622 do i think its a mans world in television that is the most ridiculous question i have been asked all week
7673623 mr paxman lists five women because he couldnt possibly name all the men in positions of power in tv because he would be there all bloody day
7673624 it seems to me that tv is a fantastic place for middle class white males they are very much judged to be the people imbued with a sort of gravitas that women are still struggling to achieve
7673625 when you look at whos making the editorial decisions we found only one out of 17 people was a woman if you look at the last series of have i got news for you out of 20 contestants they had four women there is a failure to represent women in terms of news and political content
7673626 the problems and issues they are involved in are very few in comparison to these large numbers
7673627 i would like to appeal for calm and if there is tension within the community people need to talk to the police we are aware of gang rivalries
7673628 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
7673629 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7673630 i hope the bank of england are doing more than cross their collective fingers
7673631 instead of suggesting and hinting that no bank would be allowed to fail they should do what they did in 1974 75 come out categorically and say no bank no creditors of any british bank will lose money full stop
7673632 some vulnerable citizens are going to need help for example when it comes to paying their fuel bills this winter
7673633 the worst way to approach this would be though an arbitrary and unfair tax raid that would jeopardise badly needed investment in our energy infrastructure in the years ahead
7673634 ministers need to focus their efforts on protecting those at greatest risk from the worsening economic situation that means greater support for people living under the threat of having their homes repossessed and helping the large number of vulnerable people who will be hit with huge energy bills this winter
7673635 its absolutely right that the corporations who are benefiting from that original investment and the later privatisation pay their fair share to society
7673636 the majority of my constituents would be very much in favour of this
7673637 its just nice to have her back ill grab her give her a big hug and a kiss and tell her how much i love her and how proud i am
7673638 weve got this open top bus tour going around mansfield tomorrow but she still thinks that the party is going to be in our living room
7673639 we have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported
7673640 and we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we dont have to worry about
7673641 black youths within this country have been left to die thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7673642 now were asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations
7673643 cutting funds to vital community groups at time when we are seeing so many young people involved in knife crimes would appear to go against all common sense
7673644 its not enough for ministers to talk tough on crime they also have to support projects that help stop people getting involved in crime in the first place
7673645 frankly what derrick says is an insult to black groups and other community groups up and down the country who are being funded by local and central government and work in this area on a daily and regular basis
7673646 i do need to knock down the notion that somehow there is a national conspiracy of at best indifference and at worst an active policy that says somehow the death of young black men on our streets doesnt matter it matters profoundly and it matters in every single instance whether the individual is black or white
7673647 the national curriculum for history gives pupils the opportunity to explore the social cultural religious and ethnic diversity of various societies
7673648 winston churchill is the towering figure of 20th century british history his fight against fascism was britains finest hour our national story cant be told without churchill at the centre
7673649 we envisaged these difficulties but now that we are actually in the process of putting the claims together the situation seems to have reached an impasse i hope temporary until jersey introduces changes to the law this kind of situation was never envisaged when laws involving personal injury were drawn up
7673650 in england and wales the law on time limits changed earlier this year in a house of lords landmark decision in a v hoare otherwise known as the lotto rapist case the law lords held that a court could exercise discretion when determining whether a claim brought after the cut off date should be allowed to go ahead this decision effectively swept away the absolute bar on claims for historic sexual abuse but it could take a long time if ever for this to filter through to the jersey legal system
7673651 the legal system has to accept the reality of the situation they are not trusted at all by the victims they are held in contempt by the vast majority of the victims
7673652 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7673653 he has still got to get to the meat and potato blue collar workers
7673654 some kind of roll call but not all the states
7673655 then in november i expect to vote for the democratic party nominee because i am a good democrat
7673656 i really only know one person in new mexico who has said he will not vote for obama
7673657 disappointed that obama didnt pick hillary as his running mate
7673658 i have been a friend of hillarys for a very long time i joined her fan club four years ago i will vote for hillary here this week and then i will support obama i dont want to but i will i dont think he has been very respectful to hillary
7673659 i think our flight is part of that new reality tv show celebair
7673660 youve been in there waiting for eight hours sorry nope ive got no idea not a clue
7673661 this is yet another crushing blow against tyranny and dictatorship in this country
7673662 the area is very exposed to the falling of seracs towers of ice
7673663 there is no reason to put the lives of rescuers at risk for the sake of recovering the bodies this is no longer an emergency situation
7673664 the expedition had been planned down to the smallest detail there was no negligence the avalanche descended on us and there was nothing we could do to avoid it
7673665 it was a terrible experience until that point the climb had gone beautifully the mountain was enchanting until the arrival of that executioner announced by a sort of creaking like the breaking of a beam then total darkness for several minutes i thought i had been buried in the snow but when it was all over i found i could still breathe im alive i told myself
7673666 every summer 30 000 people climb the mont blanc range
7673667 the refuges are at bursting point the one at gouter you literally cant get into
7673668 before taking their clients up mont blanc guides should find out whether there is room in the refuges
7673669 instead of making their clients sleep on the ice and under canvas at 4 000m they should postpone the expedition
7673670 icefall avalanches can happen any day in the summer and summer climbers need to be more tuned in to them they tend to be on the look out for other hazards like rock falls
7673671 which is not much different to being hit by a rock
7673672 the best way to avoid them is to choose a route that is not exposed to too many seracs in fact the traditional route up mont blanc du tacul was abandoned one reason being that it was far more exposed to icefalls than the one the climbers used on sunday
7673673 given that caligula is a film of historical interest we felt we could pass it uncut
7673674 im proud of the work i did in caligula theres no question about that but theres all the raunchy stuff the blatant modern day porn that bob introduced into the film after wed finished shooting that to me was an absolutely outrageous betrayal and quite unprecedented frankly it showed that bob had no class whatsoever
7673675 when gore told me it was bob guccione i asked isnt he a pornographer gore said malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques well of course that wasnt true
7673676 it went in where angels fear to tread in many scenes youre going oh my god i cant believe were actually going to shoot this it was sort of horrific but it was also wonderful
7673677 given that caligula is a film of historical interest we felt we could pass it uncut
7673678 but the prime minister has many other commitments so that may not be possible
7673679 i believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation
7673680 give me more than half of your honestly earned money or you will be arrested
7673681 give me more than half of your honestly earned money or gt you will be arrested
7673682 give me more than half of your honestly earned money or gt gt you will be arrested
7673683 the following is a list of beliefs that i hold nearly every one of them was a liberal position until the late 1960s
7673684 give me more than half of your honestly earned money or gt gt gt you will be arrested
7673685 give me more than half of your gt gt gt honestly earned money or you will be arrested
7673686 the coastline as it is now will be completely changed by the end of this century because the sea level is rising along the coast at around two centimetres every year
7673687 increasing salinity will make the ground water undrinkable and unsuitable for agricultural purposes the result will be food and water insecurity
7673688 it is all due to climate change the greenhouse gas emissions result in global warming and subsequent melting of the greenland ice cap
7673689 i think the best way out for the moment is devising simpler and more cost effective solutions such as how to preserve towns and villages under threat and preventing sea water intrusion
7673690 the sensible option is moving to higher ground which is a tough option especially for nigeria as it means giving up its economic centres in lagos and its oil installations in the delta
7673691 every solution to a problem must focus on the major cause of that problem and in this case greenhouse gas emissions by industrialised countries which are responsible for sea level rise must be effectively tackled
7673692 the industrialised countries should take proactive steps in curtailing their emissions responsible for climate change which will have a positive impact on sea level rise
7673693 everyone was saying what did i think about the rumours
7673694 being in beijing we did not hear it so it came as a bit of a shock to come back and hear it
7673695 i am looking forward to spending time with her as a friend and touring the country with her
7673696 we are determined to continue in kent the spirit and commitment of section 28
7673697 thanks to protective zoning laws plaka had become habitable again and was no longer just for night life
7673698 we thought it would be a wonderful place to bring up our baby son
7673699 im dead against any such move if anything laws should be more stringent in plaka
7673700 for 30 years successive governments from both the left and right have maintained a common front in protecting plaka and now we have a an environment minister who unbelievably appears to be giving in to certain interests
7673701 every day we see laws being flouted because of ineffective policing
7673702 were not against having tavernas or bars in the area we just want to keep the equilibrium that has allowed people and businesses in plaka to coexist otherwise residents will simply leave
7673703 this is a very serious breach of our building security we are urgently reviewing the security measures in place at all of our premises
7673704 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is the british government in london
7673705 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7673706 such language as has been used by this sinn f in representative begins to cast significant doubt on sinn f ins commitment to making progress in stormont
7673707 under the new system no low skilled migrants will be allowed into the uk from outside the eu that is a large amount of people who are being written off but who add a huge amount to the diversity of an area and local economy
7673708 were also worried that the system is based on a short term economic analysis of what migrants bring to a country a migrant may be entrepreneurial once they have arrived in this country ie they create a skill we just dont know
7673709 migrant labour is by no means the only solution to our tight labour market the national skills strategy was launched to address the needs of our domestic labour force
7673710 fowler lays out in detail all the mistakes the tories made and we are making them one by one
7673711 this is the first time in years writing about politics and political books that i have ever urged a tory tome on fellow labour mps and activists fowler provides the blueprint for defeating the tories it must be read by all labour ministers and mps everything he writes applies to labour today
7673712 the real truth about the conservative party at westminster in 1990s is that it did not have the will to fight to retain power
7673713 a party which appears disunited quarrelsome and frankly unpleasant will never win an election
7673714 another key bit of advice is do not slavishly woo the media as invitations for private dinners at chequers or no 10 never produce lasting benefits
7673715 its a sad indictment of our broken society that so many are turning to things like drug and alcohol abuse at such a young age
7673716 the objective was due to be met in 2005 but in recognition that nearly all member states are finding this very challenging the government intends to apply for this compliance flexibility
7673717 my officials wish to work with your officials we should not underestimate the scale of the task and we will also need to develop further national as well as local measures
7673718 the government has been aware of the problem since 1999 but has taken no action
7673719 these obligations can only be met if long overdue action is taken now
7673720 he is also working through transport for london to cut emissions from transport through a shift to walking and cycling and the use of new technology he has committed 1m for the development of less polluting taxis while by 2012 all new buses on the streets will have lower emission hybrid engines
7673721 moved ahead in the negotiations at a pace much faster than the african nations could handle
7673722 the nightmare scenario of crops being transported out of fortified farms as hungry locals look on
7673723 the investors hope to be able to bypass any potential trade restriction that the host country might impose during a crisis
7673724 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7673725 it is fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7673726 some people have said it is as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal with in the 1970s
7673727 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities
7673728 it has been very much ebb and flow and the mood here is very much one of financial caution as regards next year we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7673729 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year
7673730 one would hope that the conditions in credit markets should gradually start to improve and those two factors will help to ensure growth will start to pick up as we go through next year
7673731 history will show who is selling brazil and who is defending the nation
7673732 way of life and set a catastrophic precedent for indians all over the country
7673733 brazil wants to be a big power but this does not give it the right to steamroll over the rights of the indians
7673734 the development of our country cannot be achieved through the extinction of its indigenous people and by disrespecting their rights the big economic interests see aborigines as an obstacle
7673735 all christians have an important role to play in developing their own environmental awareness and encouraging it in others this will prove invaluable for those looking to find a deeper theological understanding of our christian concern for creation
7673736 this book offers us not just tips on energy saving but a reorientation
7673737 the intention is not to urge christians to get measured for a hair shirt but to rediscover how good and joyful a thing it is to dwell together in unity with everything else that lives
7673738 the objective was due to be met in 2005 but in recognition that nearly all member states are finding this very challenging the government intends to apply for this compliance flexibility
7673739 my officials wish to work with your officials we should not underestimate the scale of the task and we will also need to develop further national as well as local measures
7673740 the government has been aware of the problem since 1999 but has taken no action
7673741 these obligations can only be met if long overdue action is taken now
7673742 he is also working through transport for london to cut emissions from transport through a shift to walking and cycling and the use of new technology he has committed 1m for the development of less polluting taxis while by 2012 all new buses on the streets will have lower emission hybrid engines

7673744 the free market economy is the fairest way of rewarding people for their efforts
7673745 not only reading and analysing briefs but also virtually knowing them off by heart
7673746 under the new system no low skilled migrants will be allowed into the uk from outside the eu that is a large amount of people who are being written off but who add a huge amount to the diversity of an area and local economy
7673747 were also worried that the system is based on a short term economic analysis of what migrants bring to a country a migrant may be entrepreneurial once they have arrived in this country ie they create a skill we just dont know
7673748 migrant labour is by no means the only solution to our tight labour market the national skills strategy was launched to address the needs of our domestic labour force
7673749 this is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive it indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem
7673750 i dont think you could measure this by other non lethal means
7673751 lots of dead bodies will provide robust data so if you kill lots of whales then you will get some information the question is whether the benefits outweigh the number of whales killed and how they were killed scientific whaling is not about science and there is no pressing conservation need that requires it
7673752 when we left the camp they all gave us pieces of paper with a telephone number on them saying when you get back to france phone my friend phone my father phone my brother say we are here that their uncle is dead and that we are here and they have to help us that is how it began during the war in bosnia it was the same in the 45 times i went there every time we have come back from mostar or sarajevo and so on we had a list of people to call when we got home
7673753 every time we saw the same thing there is a need for victims to be able to communicate and all the non governmental organisations ngos also need telecommunications
7673754 part of the problem is that i have a big mouth
7673755 now i am more not relaxed but careful about what i say
7673756 we opened our little centre in a village school and a load of people came what was fantastic was that a few days later i remember seeing people arriving in cars to take away their family and we thought this idea is good
7673757 it was our first intervention for a natural disaster we stayed there for 10 days
7673758 the most dangerous thing we do is use the local equipment like cars and helicopters we go to poor countries and the cars are old and we drive very fast because we have to arrive very quickly the helicopters we have to use are sometimes helicopters that should not be made to fly but in an emergency you have no choice
7673759 with the threat of legislation looming bmw has shown that even premium carmakers can seriously reduce co2 but the slow response of most carmakers shows that the eu needs to keep up the pressure with challenging long term co2 targets
7673760 german carmakers want co2 targets to apply only to the cleanest cars in the early years its like demanding that smoking ban should apply initially only to non smokers
7673761 mi5 has concluded that there is no easy way to identify those who become involved in terrorism in britain

7673764 we should never overstate the menace we face from violent extremism
7673765 entirely acceptable and indeed necessary for academics to seek to understand and explain what motivates violent extremists

7673769 there is a lot of pre emptive demolition going on this is already having a visual impact cities are beginning to look like broken teeth
7673770 we are spending public money demolishing buildings to avoid this ill thought out stealth tax
7673771 swindon like many other towns across the country could suffer if regeneration projects are shelved as a result of this
7673772 reforms to empty property relief are aimed at ensuring there is a fairer balance between incentives to re let property and giving property managers a period of relief while they manage vacancies
7673773 its effecting me because im longing to visit other relatives but cant because of the expensive gas prices

7673775 with the threat of legislation looming bmw has shown that even premium carmakers can seriously reduce co2 but the slow response of most carmakers shows that the eu needs to keep up the pressure with challenging long term co2 targets

7673779 peoples perceptions are that when they rent larger vehicles the cost of filling up with gas is going to be a lot higher
7673780 they would have a few little cars and a huge field of beautiful suvs next to them
7673781 car rental people have not seen such an abrupt change in demand at the counter ever before
7673782 people used to be very happy when they were upgraded
7673783 all of a sudden people are getting very vocal about not wanting a larger car
7673784 we always said training was essential but they ask for more training for a man selling lettuce in the market because he has to use a machine than estate agents
7673785 companies who had always focused on web based activities without the massive overheads associated with a network of physical branch offices are the ones more likely to weather the storm
7673786 it is very important to us that people stay and make the whole thing work
7673787 we are doing this acquisition so we can leverage all the employees
7673788 everyone wants a deal but there are still details to be cleared
7673789 we are committed to googlers and providing them a great working environment but we dont comment on internal specifics

7673797 in this study to design and develop socks that provide wearing comfort the way of preventing slipping down of socks top parts is investigated the subjects are 10 males who walk on a running machine with changing stitches of leg and heel parts partly in the socks pressure values of top parts of socks during walking experiment are measured and the slippage of the top are evaluated
7673798 the top part of socks becomes difficult to slip down with the purl stitches of leg part partly because of the decrease of extending down the leg part by the foot part the variation of pressure values is large in the front region and the variation of pressure values is small in the back region during walking because of the hardness of skin when the movement of an ankle is strong the slippage of top parts increases but using stitches that have big extension decreases the slippage effectively

7673815 la claridad de la orden no puede soslayarse por un guardi n del inpec mucho menos por un director
7673816 al pretenderse la efectividad del mecanismo sustitutivo se encontr la sala con una respuesta descomedida e inaceptable por parte del entonces director del inpec en la cual abusivamente desde luego y demorando conscientemente el cumplimiento de la sentencia inquir a a la corte acerca de la improcedencia de la sustituci n alegando que ella no proced a por v a de la ley 750 de 2002 queriendo ignorar que precisamente la sala hab a descartado tal mecanismo aplicando en cambio por favorabilidad las normas de la ley 906 04 semejante actitud de una autoridad administrativa frente a una judicial que no tiene cabida en un estado de derecho

7673825 theres an enormous amount of things that can be learned here whether its about enrico fermi the history of nuclear energy or how a nuclear plant works
7673826 we want people to be able to stop in and spend some time here
7673827 we envisaged these difficulties but now that we are actually in the process of putting the claims together the situation seems to have reached an impasse i hope temporary until jersey introduces changes to the law this kind of situation was never envisaged when laws involving personal injury were drawn up
7673828 in england and wales the law on time limits changed earlier this year in a house of lords landmark decision in a v hoare otherwise known as the lotto rapist case the law lords held that a court could exercise discretion when determining whether a claim brought after the cut off date should be allowed to go ahead this decision effectively swept away the absolute bar on claims for historic sexual abuse but it could take a long time if ever for this to filter through to the jersey legal system
7673829 the legal system has to accept the reality of the situation they are not trusted at all by the victims they are held in contempt by the vast majority of the victims
7673830 we have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported
7673831 and we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we dont have to worry about
7673832 black youths within this country have been left to die thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7673833 now were asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations
7673834 cutting funds to vital community groups at time when we are seeing so many young people involved in knife crimes would appear to go against all common sense
7673835 its not enough for ministers to talk tough on crime they also have to support projects that help stop people getting involved in crime in the first place
7673836 frankly what derrick says is an insult to black groups and other community groups up and down the country who are being funded by local and central government and work in this area on a daily and regular basis
7673837 i do need to knock down the notion that somehow there is a national conspiracy of at best indifference and at worst an active policy that says somehow the death of young black men on our streets doesnt matter it matters profoundly and it matters in every single instance whether the individual is black or white
7673838 the problems and issues they are involved in are very few in comparison to these large numbers
7673839 i would like to appeal for calm and if there is tension within the community people need to talk to the police we are aware of gang rivalries
7673840 its a sad indictment of our broken society that so many teenagers are turning to things like drugs and alcohol abuse at such a young age the government needs to take action now
7673841 the true toll on teenagers lives is far higher we must do more to tackle the wider causes of social breakdown that means we need to strengthen families radically reform the welfare system and provide more good school places
7673842 i would like to appeal for calm in the sense that a life has been wasted and if there is tension within the community then people need to talk to the police
7673843 we are aware of gang rivalries when there is a shooting in birmingham tensions between gangs do arise and as part of keeping an open mind if this does end up being part of a gang dispute then we would appeal for calm
7673844 we are very much alive to the intelligence that comes from the community itself and we have put extra resources on the ground we have put on high visibility patrols and that does include armed patrols
7673845 this type of crime does remain rare in terms of gun crime in birmingham one murder is one murder too many and we will pull out all the stops to bring this case to a satisfactory conclusion
7673846 our thoughts have to be with his family he was a son a brother and dear friend
7673847 we are keeping an open mind the investigation is at an early stage we are aware there is tension between rival gangs i am not saying mr foskin was in gangs at all we have to enable young people to come together and resolve their differences
7673848 he was lovely funny and gentle i have no idea why somebody would want to do something like this
7673849 he was caring and laid back and he had a very close family he was a family boy the people who have done this can run but they cant hide and hopefully justice will be done
7673850 i just had the call early this morning to say what happened and were going to pay our respects to the family
7673851 theres just not enough policing in the area and we need more officers on the beat

7673925 the images of hundreds of thousands of people from around the world gathering in randwick racecourse to pray with pope benedict will become an enduring reminder of one of the most special events in sydneys history
7673926 the racecourse was a wonderful venue spacious close to the city and easily accessible for the hundreds of thousands of pilgrims and australians who took part we are grateful to the nsw government and the racing industry for making it available to world youth day
7673927 we know we have been good custodians all construction work on the racecourse was carried out strictly in line with measures approved by the project steering committee chaired by hugh martin and comprising representatives from the ajc the nsw government and wyd08
7673928 we expect to be able to hand back barangaroo to the nsw government by the end of this month
7673929 both sites provided spectacular settings for solemn yet joyous liturgical events watched by up to a billion people globally
7673930 every sydneysider no matter what their faith should be proud of the way in which the city hosted the youth of the world in july
7673931 houve desrespeito da parte dele em se recusar a ir para a concentra o e o resto do grupo que est trabalhando se esfor ando
7673932 fico feliz por ter contribu do mas tenho muito mais a dar pelo sport se me cobraram muito antes pelo que fiz nesse in cio de temporada e nos juniores
7673933 a parte f sica melhorou bastante e o que ainda pesa um pouco a falta de ritmo mas isso d para tirar de letra e evoluir a cada dia
7673934 we are a catholic church ministered by two catholic priests from a community which has many leaders in the catholic church
7673935 we do have a radical point of view in terms of christian prayer
7673936 and we have to confront the issues that the archbishop has raised
7673937 the information ive got is that this all happened because the statue was reported by an extremely conservative right wing member of the church
7673938 when people take notice of a person of that sort then these kinds of things happen as a reaction
7673939 i think a church that refuses homosexual people as part of the church is not catholic and not christian
7673940 if were going to be doing what we do in the tradition of jesus then theres no basis for refusing anyone
7673941 the archbishop hopes wisdom prevails in south brisbane and i do too
7673942 you have a style of writing i just cant do
7673943 committing yourself to one job for a life time is a different notion for this generation
7673944 the young generation is not as attracted to the church as in previous generations
7673945 there was a need for one parish not to have a resident priest for a six month period for six months the priest will not live there new arrangements will be made once we complete our dialogues
7673946 its a situation we are now finding we have to do more and more
7673947 our customers demand rugged solutions that perform in extreme environments core systems sales engineers and engineering staff work closely with our customer to bridge the hardware engineering gap which is somewhat unique in our industry
7673948 many of us are aware of the important role played by diocesan publications or the publications produced by various religious orders
7673949 but do we have a real idea of what other catholic groups or organisations are doing in the media field whether it be print television radio or the web
7673950 the australian catholic media council under the auspices of the bishops commission for mission and faith formation has developed a quick simple online survey which we hope will help us to fill in the gaps by identifying exactly which catholic organisations are engaged in media or communications and the ways in which they are engaged
7673951 with your help we can gather crucial information which it is hoped will form the basis of an online australian catholic media directory
7673952 i ask that you pass this survey link on to the appropriate person in your organisation and ask them to complete the survey and submit it by thursday august 28 it will take just a few minutes and is quick and easy to complete
7673953 i know that people are dying in hospitals through avoidable causes because this has been partly reported
7673954 but the extent of this is really shocking and i think reba meagher has got some answering to do today
7673955 how do we address the issue is the key lesson that we have to take away from these individual cases
7673956 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible
7673957 ive moved down to the beach with tito i love being by the beach
7673958 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
7673959 the story you are about to hear is true thisis sister wynona carr and i was called out on a case
7673960 carrs contralto vocals have a sensual husky quality quite unusual or even inappropriate for gospel singers in her day which made her eventual switch to r amp b and rock amp roll seem a logical choice in retrospect
7673961 i dont think any one of us would suggest that we want to live across the street where little kids walk to school literally across the street from the major indeed the only entry and exit point to whats going to be so intense a use youre going to have 1 000 people a day minimum
7673962 lightweight trailers such as the keystone passport show that a full size trailer can now be towed by a newer generation of crossover vehicles and lightweight trucks
7673963 we are trying to dispel the myths to consumers that a big engine or suv is needed to tow a full size rv
7673964 as we launched the new 2009 kia borrego we wanted to show its towing capabilities
7673965 the kia borrego serves a wide range of consumer needs from outdoor adventurers to those looking for a reliable economical safe and stylish everyday vehicle
7673966 look ill be doing everything i can to make this dream come true for south australians
7673967 it would be helped if mr rann sa premier came along with us in a bipartisan way
7673968 we havent set an exact closing date but it would probably be around the april may or june time frame and they would have to have a proposal to us at that stage that would be their final proposal
7673969 it can still be made we will actually be putting proposals to the commonwealth games association from opposition
7673970 a bid from an opposition group would be very difficult because they couldnt guarantee theyd be in power at that time
7673971 i think youve got to have vision athletes have vision and goals if you dont have goals and this is a big one but i really see this as an investment
7673972 tokyo is a shining star in the world of cuisine
7673973 we found the citys restaurants to be excellent featuring the best ingredients culinary talents and a tradition passed on from generation to generation and refined by todays chefs
7673974 there are a lot of great cities in the world
7673975 tokyo is an exciting place to eat but paris is an exciting place to eat so is rome
7673976 i dont think it is helpful to make that kind of statement
7673977 tokyo has the best japanese food in the world but it is nowhere near as diverse as other cities
7673978 tokyo ii mise umai mise tokyo good restaurant delicious restaurant
7673979 i think we can call it the culinary capital of the world
7673980 if you try any cuisine its hard to go wrong in tokyo
7673981 you can find many places that are not publicized at all but are still good especially when you are traveling rural europe
7673982 there is no doubt anymore about that foreign partener lufthansa is in pole position to conclude an alliance
7673983 the use of these levels as risk markers may help clinicians to assess their patients more fully and thus to prevent in patients who have high risk
7673984 low serum cholesterol is commonly observed in individuals with ill health e g and those with unhealthy lifestyle characteristics such as smoking and heavy drinking
7673985 la comida china es tan grasienta como la peor comida occidental pero sta me fue muy til para controlar mejor mi peso
7673986 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7673987 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7673988 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7673989 it would have been the same way if i had won and barack was here supporting the unity of the party
7673990 this was a hard fought campaign and there was a lot of intensity and passion associated with it in part because of the historic nature of our two candidacies
7673991 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7673992 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7673993 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7673994 this is one of the kindest things ive ever experienced i have no way of knowing who sent it but there is a beautiful soul working in the dead letter office at the post office
7673995 cycling can be fun for all the family even little ones can join in riding on a child seat behind you a family day out on bicycles perhaps with a picnic is a memorable way to share adventures choose a route with safe but fun challenges such as going up and down hills and splashing through streams
7673996 younger generations in particular have jumped back into the political game because information is now available through media that speaks to them well provide an alternative to the traditional big media coverage and present a unique view of the convention
7673997 maybe this would be an encouragement for employers to hire mature workers who have completed their family no more maternity leave
7673998 if you see a yellow bus then it goes along the yellow line route and the bus stops will also be painted yellow so that people can easily identify route they are taking
7673999 for instance the present service along the kuching serian route entails a turn around journey of 200 minutes at a frequency of 30 minutes for rm5 with the hub the time will be reduced to a 120 minute turn around shortening the frequency to 20 minutes at a fare of rm3 50 perhaps with the same number of buses
7674000 so phase ii will be organising kereta sewa to link up the buses via an easy payment system under the flexiday pass ultimately there will be a 24 7 24 hours seven days on call door to door service
7674001 we hope to incorporate kereta sawa into our system and ask for subsidy for them later
7674002 well do whatever we can to provide security for the children such as using id tags fashioned in the best possible way like a bracelet as soon as the child boards the bus a computer will capture the tag and well know the child is on board
7674003 for a certain fee we can provide a report via sms or the internet to inform parents that their children have boarded the bus we can also install a video cam in the bus
7674004 we need a transport policy an integrated one and also a main body to coordinate all these its time to give back to society
7674005 the real focus is providing a transport service in the interest of the public so more often than not a public transport system is subsidised from public funds
7674006 look at curitiba in brazil although a third world city in the middle of the country it has probably the best public transport system in the world along with an extremely high standard of living
7674007 kuching city is small in fact all the cities in malaysia are small by world standard even kuala lumpur so do not equate the problems of public transport in malaysia with the size of the whole country instead look at localised cities why talk about the whole country when we cant even run a decent public transport in a small town get that right first
7674008 if you talk about taxis they are a privately run system but you need to regulate them find a system for them to earn a living
7674009 ive never been more bored of ernest talking and ive known him for three years dewar god make it stop
7674010 if your hair is pink you cannot acquire an education from our school
7674011 every morning im not found face down in my oatmeal is another fucking miracle
7674012 the supreme court has held that all counsel have a duty to bring to the federal tribunals attention without delay facts that may raise a question of mootness
7674013 regardless of the debtors motives we cannot permit the court to be subject to such manipulation we conclude that by failing to raise the release issue in the prior appeal the debtor waived its right to assert the defense in subsequent proceedings settlement and release is an affirmative defense and is generally waived if not asserted in the answer to a complaint
7674014 the debtor argued that even if it had raised the release issue during the prior appeal we would have been required to remand the matter for factual findings implying that its failure to inform the court of the settlement agreement was harmless and should be without consequence
7674015 r egardless of the likelihood that remand for factfinding might have been necessary the decision whether and when to remand the matter was one for the court to make not the debtor the debtor usurped the decision as to how the case should be organized when it proceeded with the arguments it had already presented on appeal and elected not to advise the court of an event which it believed disposed of the claim the bankruptcy court was correct in its assessment that having taken its shot the debtor does not get another opportunity to reach into its quiver for another arrow

7674018 a memorial conceived by colonial henry wooldridge whose central marble image was carved in italy devoted to the memory of his family and his life
7674019 this is defined as someone who has to have their hand in everything and who does not let anyone else do anything on their own
7674020 it often says more about who they are than about the leader they are labeling i like what i heard once say
7674021 if you are leading you have to be freaky about control
7674022 that is the responsibility of a leader to have control to know what is going on to be in control is what gives a leader credibility if you are not in control then i would suggest you are probably not leading

7674024 computers like cats can operate crossdimensionally the trick is in getting them to do what you want
7674025 greece does not have folk music and it does not have folklore
7674026 folk music is by definition irish pop music specifically irish pop music influenced by eastern european dance music
7674027 rave and trance on technical grounds should be classified as classical
7674028 bluegrass is african american actually its origin is french just like rap but it has nothing to do with folk folk is irish pop music concocted in the 50s and 60s which uses instruments that werent invented until the 30s
7674029 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker

7674108 compared to the previous two olympics the atmosphere was better because of the range of medals we were getting from all different sports

7674113 the number of arrests is up on last year but that is predominantly because of proactive policing
7674114 the message is that there is no place for knives at the carnival

7674129 under the new system no low skilled migrants will be allowed into the uk from outside the eu that is a large amount of people who are being written off but who add a huge amount to the diversity of an area and local economy
7674130 were also worried that the system is based on a short term economic analysis of what migrants bring to a country a migrant may be entrepreneurial once they have arrived in this country ie they create a skill we just dont know
7674131 migrant labour is by no means the only solution to our tight labour market the national skills strategy was launched to address the needs of our domestic labour force
7674132 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is the british government in london
7674133 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month

7674137 the real truth about the conservative party at westminster in 1990s is that it did not have the will to fight to retain power
7674138 a party which appears disunited quarrelsome and frankly unpleasant will never win an election
7674139 another key bit of advice is do not slavishly woo the media as invitations for private dinners at chequers or no 10 never produce lasting benefits

7674145 actor stephen fry is the author of the book the liar and was an active supporter of the liberal british labour party though he did not vote for it in a recent election because it was not leftist enough on the iraq war

7674149 our studies in mice showed that we could selectively kill the defective autoimmune cells that were destroying insulin producing islets
7674150 these results show that the same selective destruction can occur in human cells and connect what we saw in our animal studies with the protocol we are pursuing in our phase i clinical trial
7674151 evidence is still required as to how long this is effective as a treatment in humans and we look forward to seeing the next stage of trials
7674152 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7674153 we think it is self rewarding in the sense that the animals get something positive out of doing this
7674154 the only way to explain why you would feel good about doing something for somebody else is if you have some sort of stake in their welfare and thats really what the empathy mechanism is all about
7674155 and we discovered an area where the countryside just looks similar to england with oak trees and other familiar locations
7674156 there may be issues with cost and the odd telegraph pole in the background but surely with the technology they have and a bit of camera work this wouldnt be a problem
7674157 fields have been enclosed railways built the english landscape has been completely transformed
7674158 there is a lot of pre emptive demolition going on this is already having a visual impact cities are beginning to look like broken teeth

7674162 all christians have an important role to play in developing their own environmental awareness and encouraging it in others this will prove invaluable for those looking to find a deeper theological understanding of our christian concern for creation
7674163 this book offers us not just tips on energy saving but a reorientation
7674164 the intention is not to urge christians to get measured for a hair shirt but to rediscover how good and joyful a thing it is to dwell together in unity with everything else that lives
7674165 the objective was due to be met in 2005 but in recognition that nearly all member states are finding this very challenging the government intends to apply for this compliance flexibility
7674166 my officials wish to work with your officials we should not underestimate the scale of the task and we will also need to develop further national as well as local measures
7674167 the government has been aware of the problem since 1999 but has taken no action
7674168 these obligations can only be met if long overdue action is taken now

7674190 with the threat of legislation looming bmw has shown that even premium carmakers can seriously reduce co2 but the slow response of most carmakers shows that the eu needs to keep up the pressure with challenging long term co2 targets
7674191 german carmakers want co2 targets to apply only to the cleanest cars in the early years its like demanding that smoking ban should apply initially only to non smokers
7674192 i dont know how old hilary is or if shes still in school but shes too young for me im an old man and shes a baby
7674193 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
7674194 great things are not done by impulse but by a series
7674195 i guess sometimes the past just catches up to you whether you want it to or not usually death row is called the last mile we call ours the green mile the floor was the color of faded limes
7674196 the downgrade of the bfsr reflects moodys view that fannie mae and freddie macs financial flexibility to manage potential volatility in its mortgage risk exposures is constricted in particular given recent market movement moodys believe these companies currently have limited access to common and preferred equity capital at economically attractive terms
7674197 the gses more limited financial flexibility also restricts their ability to pursue their public mission of providing liquidity stability and affordability to the us housing market fannie mae and freddie mac currently make up approximately 75 of the mortgage market in the us a reduction in the capacity of these companies to support the us mortgage market could have significant repercussions for the us economy in an effort to thwart broader economic effects moodys believes the likelihood of direct support from the united states treasury has increased
7674198 theyve raised billions of dollars they said they didnt need to replace losses they said they didnt have
7674199 blessed is the man who fears the lord who delights greatly in his commandments
7674200 when we left the camp they all gave us pieces of paper with a telephone number on them saying when you get back to france phone my friend phone my father phone my brother say we are here that their uncle is dead and that we are here and they have to help us that is how it began during the war in bosnia it was the same in the 45 times i went there every time we have come back from mostar or sarajevo and so on we had a list of people to call when we got home
7674201 every time we saw the same thing there is a need for victims to be able to communicate and all the non governmental organisations ngos also need telecommunications
7674202 part of the problem is that i have a big mouth
7674203 now i am more not relaxed but careful about what i say
7674204 we opened our little centre in a village school and a load of people came what was fantastic was that a few days later i remember seeing people arriving in cars to take away their family and we thought this idea is good
7674205 it was our first intervention for a natural disaster we stayed there for 10 days
7674206 the most dangerous thing we do is use the local equipment like cars and helicopters we go to poor countries and the cars are old and we drive very fast because we have to arrive very quickly the helicopters we have to use are sometimes helicopters that should not be made to fly but in an emergency you have no choice
7674207 for the third year in a row we have sold in excess of 1 5m tickets
7674208 that is a terrific achievement against a backdrop of the global economic situation an incredibly wet august competition from a fantastic olympic games and of course the problems with the box office system
7674209 i think the box office effect has been the major issue at this years festival i think it has caused a great deal of upset with the public and it has impacted on a proportion of the audience who will have been put off
7674210 i think weve lost the confidence of the public through ticketing and i think it will take a long time to build it up again
7674211 there are an estimated 18m policies in circulation most of them mis sold
7674212 this is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive it indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem
7674213 i dont think you could measure this by other non lethal means
7674214 lots of dead bodies will provide robust data so if you kill lots of whales then you will get some information the question is whether the benefits outweigh the number of whales killed and how they were killed scientific whaling is not about science and there is no pressing conservation need that requires it
7674215 men wanted for hazardous journey small wages bitter cold long months of complete darkness constant danger safe return doubtful honour and recognition in case of success
7674216 we want someone whose cup is always half full never half empty who will be the first to volunteer for the cooking rather than crawling into their sleeping bag who can laugh at themselves and keep others spirits up when the chips are down
7674217 it has taken us five years to get the trip off the ground but anyone reasonably fit who goes to the gym and is a strong team player can apply to join us for the last 12 days of the trek

7674222 tenemos una larga deuda social y cultural con el pa s profundo
7674223 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7674224 it is fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7674225 some people have said it is as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal with in the 1970s
7674226 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities
7674227 it has been very much ebb and flow and the mood here is very much one of financial caution as regards next year we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7674228 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year
7674229 one would hope that the conditions in credit markets should gradually start to improve and those two factors will help to ensure growth will start to pick up as we go through next year
7674230 gps claim back from the nhs a standard price for each drug prescribed whatever they have actually paid for it
7674231 whilst we are pleased with the momentum in the business we are mindful that discretionary spending continues to be influenced by macro economic factors such as inflation fluctuating petrol prices interest rates and lower consumer confidence levels
7674232 we have continued to refine our brand proposition with significant investment in price merchandise range and quality during the year
7674233 flight centre starts the new financial year with significant momentum from 2007 08 a strong balance sheet and with foundations in place for further growth
7674234 while we do not expect to replicate the 30 per cent to 40 per cent increases we have achieved in each of the past two years we will be disappointed if we do not increase pre tax profit by 10 to 15 per cent
7674235 flight centre continues to increase its scale in all countries while also developing a broader foundation
7674236 in addition to being one of the worlds leading leisure travel providers the company is now a significant and emerging presence in global corporate and wholesale travel
7674237 we see our diversity of both brands and geography as a platform for the future and a real strength
7674238 we believe we will emerge from this economic cycle in an even stronger competitive position
7674239 if you had to leave your house for 24 hours and could only take one item with you what would you take
7674240 we had some not lolly gagging but just kind of going through the motions a little bit in practice speaking for myself
7674241 weve got to correct that point blank frustrated about that yes totally we absolutely cannot continue to let carson get hit we cannot allow that to happen period
7674242 its just a matter of can i run with people pushing on me that type of stuff well see
7674243 ive talked to a lot of people who have played with this injury
7674244 they didnt get surgery and they played and had a successful season so ill be fine
7674245 i asked marvin to play thursday not to prove a point but to show that im ready to go
7674246 and he told me no theres no need i already got hurt in one preseason game theres no reason for another i will be ready for the opener
7674247 you never want to see a picture like that no matter who it is

7674249 google looks as if its on top of the world right now holding an ever increasing lions share of the search market the way it treats its employees writes preston gralla another example google employees such as sergey solyanik have started deserting the company and its share price is down double that of the dow or nasdaq since november 2007 even if google has lost its mojo why should you care it wont make your searches any less effective will it nope but google has its eyes on bigger things than search notably your it department its looking to displace microsoft with hosted services like google apps gmail and google docs solyanik warns that googles engineers care more about the coolness of a service than about the services effectiveness
7674250 we have the greatest child care in the world at x dollars
7674251 i need to know that the code is useful for others and the only way to measure the usefulness is by the amount of money that the people are willing to part with to have access to my work sorry open source fanatics your world is not for me
7674252 all of them are free and its anyones guess how many people would actually pay say 5 per month to use gmail for me this really does make the project less interesting if people are not willing to pay for it
7674253 parents who had been paying 1 425 a month for infant care would see their costs rise to nearly 2 500
7674254 of course google employees version of being mistreated is often laughable and quite a shock when they look for their massage therapist at wherever they end up next
7674255 google has drastically cut back their budget on the culinary program how is it affecting campus no more dinner no more tea trolley no more snack attack in the afternoon
7674256 i am ready to meet my maker whether my maker is prepared for the great ordeal of meeting me is another matter
7674257 i bestow honor on give up all nuclear assets and downsize your armed forces to a token level then see how the mare goes but first decide whether there is self esteem in this the third and preferred path to salvation lies in wisdom wisdom demands that regardless of numbers our rulers should put aside their differences and get together to form a national government in which every region province ethnicity language and sect is represented to work together to take the country out of the perfect storm it is engulfed in sadly wisdom is also something that has passed us by entirely more even than our propensity to revolution the greeks said those whom the gods would destroy they our people are not mad they are desperate they are desperate because the choices before them are all anchored in past military regimes their leaders and their continuation born of military patronage if they had a fresh new choice anchored in the people without doubt they would decide sensibly there is vacuum for a new political force to emerge and fill a force that is anchored in a native ideology and rooted in the land and its people let there be a community from among you that invites to all that is good and enjoins the doing of what is known by common sense and sound minds to be right and forbids the doing of what is known by common sense and sound minds to be wrong and it is they who attain to success
7674258 and incline not toward those who do wrong lest the fire should touch you and you have no protectors other than allah nor you would then be helped
7674259 turn switch off the button that measures my willingness to belief and switch on some form of measurement for my true human nature
7674260 because i believe that the only safe way to live your life religiously speaking is to live it honestly without causing harm to others etc and generally just be a decent human being

7674267 when her fellow traffic agents came back from a stressful day on the job they could always count on donnette to lighten their mood with a joke or a funny comment
7674268 she grew up on an island known for its beauty and serenity and she carried that with her even as she walked the streets of new york city
7674269 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7674270 shes been an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy jackson and simon cowell offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist to the thousands who have competed on american idol with kara by her side paula finally has some back up and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7674271 that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers

7674290 the bottom line from my perspective is the surgery went well
7674291 right now its a rough day for him but everything went well
7674292 he was fixing to be a big part of this team and to go out there on that field and see this kid laying there after what he went through was tough
7674293 we were talking about it this morning you can be out there in one play and it can be over for you just like that

7674299 my mind hasnt really raced too far from that ive tried to just focus on being here but obviously it will depend on you know its very tough now for either me or my husband to be away from my son
7674300 when i went to beijing i left him for two weeks and it was heart breaking its like we definitely did this journey to be a family and its obviously not easy when you have two working parents and one traveling you know well have to see how i feel if theres any motivation how it affects everybody thats involved with us and take it from there
7674301 i think it feels like a whole different element this year
7674302 you know two years ago here i obviously didnt have a child then to worry about and made this comeback and have taken some time off
7674303 but i think each time i play a grand slam i always think that oh this could be my last time playing here ive obviously learned that i have no idea what the future kind of holds and what will happen and i dont make decisions for the future anymore from this day that im living in but sure im here i mean im so excited to be back here i didnt think i would be back playing you never know how many more chances youll get to be playing here
7674304 well i still think i can do well if i can stay healthy its obviously been a battle this year and a battle that its been hard to fight but really the olympics and the us open have kind of kept me going
7674305 but i really dont have any performance goals because i dont know really what will happen

7674319 i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
7674320 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7674321 the carnival is the perfect london spectacle to captivate the world with its dazzling array of costumes and music
7674322 this years event was enjoyed by more than a million people as the sights and sounds of the caribbean and other cultures came alive on the streets
7674323 i love the music and the dancing and im definitely going to come again next year
7674324 its giving both an opportunity to further develop their fan bases and develop further excitement around the potential of them coming together
7674325 if chris destroys another opponent people are really going to be clamoring especially if gina gets in and clobbers hers its just really about letting the fighters develop letting them grow in their skills and their character development in order for them to eventually meet one another
7674326 it could be but weve got a couple ideas and were not fully committed to exactly how thats going to be
7674327 but were committed to an early 2009 ppv event thats what this is really all about isnt it
7674328 forget the hunger the malnutrition the lack of schools and teachers hospitals doctors medicines and other vital necessities from which the world suffers
7674329 european chauvinism corrupt judges the sale of muscle and brains a strong dose of racism and all at too costly a price for cuba to pay
7674330 als men blijft geloven kan de zwaartse steen niet zinken
7674331 brings together the science the art and the business of internet marketing in a complete way
7674332 a new zealand court has allowed a parade of topless porn stars on motor bikes to proceed on the main street of the country s biggest city local media said tuesday but judge nicola mathers said while opponents may find the parade offensive or tasteless the fact that 80 000 people had gathered for a similar event last year meant a significant number of people did not agree with the critics new zealand press association said
7674333 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
7674334 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
7674335 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq leadership and supporters and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
7674336 they are not heroes and dont have answers and that they harm you your country and your livelihood
7674337 it is aimed primarily but not exclusively at those working with overseas influencers and opinion formers
7674338 use advisedly avoid suggesting that aq is no longer a threat we are not claiming victory over aq we are stressing their declining support
7674339 on the defensive throughout much of the rest of the world
7674340 feed its new franchises with propaganda to keep the brand alive at all costs
7674341 on how best to tailor such material for media engagements presenting information to ministers or to other stakeholders it is in a separate unclassified format to make it the sort of product that a minister or a press officer could use before an interview or that could be given as a crib sheet for trusted contacts
7674342 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
7674343 our studies in mice showed that we could selectively kill the defective autoimmune cells that were destroying insulin producing islets
7674344 these results show that the same selective destruction can occur in human cells and connect what we saw in our animal studies with the protocol we are pursuing in our phase i clinical trial
7674345 evidence is still required as to how long this is effective as a treatment in humans and we look forward to seeing the next stage of trials
7674346 the objective was due to be met in 2005 but in recognition that nearly all member states are finding this very challenging the government intends to apply for this compliance flexibility
7674347 my officials wish to work with your officials we should not underestimate the scale of the task and we will also need to develop further national as well as local measures
7674348 the government has been aware of the problem since 1999 but has taken no action
7674349 these obligations can only be met if long overdue action is taken now
7674350 he is also working through transport for london to cut emissions from transport through a shift to walking and cycling and the use of new technology he has committed 1m for the development of less polluting taxis while by 2012 all new buses on the streets will have lower emission hybrid engines
7674351 in no way appropriate to either calming or defusing tensions
7674352 if they choose to break off this relationship even the whole of it nothing terrible will happen
7674353 my guess is that this vote is a means to achieve better conditions for international negotiations
7674354 if it does this russia will further isolate itself from the entire world and will force the international community to seek more active ways to restore the territorial integrity of georgia
7674355 the fact that there are nine western warships in the black sea cannot but be a cause for concern
7674356 under the new system no low skilled migrants will be allowed into the uk from outside the eu that is a large amount of people who are being written off but who add a huge amount to the diversity of an area and local economy
7674357 were also worried that the system is based on a short term economic analysis of what migrants bring to a country a migrant may be entrepreneurial once they have arrived in this country ie they create a skill we just dont know
7674358 migrant labour is by no means the only solution to our tight labour market the national skills strategy was launched to address the needs of our domestic labour force
7674359 history will show who is selling brazil and who is defending the nation
7674360 way of life and set a catastrophic precedent for indians all over the country
7674361 brazil wants to be a big power but this does not give it the right to steamroll over the rights of the indians
7674362 the development of our country cannot be achieved through the extinction of its indigenous people and by disrespecting their rights the big economic interests see aborigines as an obstacle
7674363 this is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive it indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem
7674364 i dont think you could measure this by other non lethal means
7674365 lots of dead bodies will provide robust data so if you kill lots of whales then you will get some information the question is whether the benefits outweigh the number of whales killed and how they were killed scientific whaling is not about science and there is no pressing conservation need that requires it
7674366 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7674367 while there is not a stable government in islamabad then the law and order situation in nwfp and the federally administered tribal areas fata will not be solved
7674368 saving lives should be the first issue then we can look at the judges
7674369 are we now a laughing stock for those who didnt want democracy in pakistan for them its a victory but were both losers
7674370 there is a lot of pre emptive demolition going on this is already having a visual impact cities are beginning to look like broken teeth
7674371 we are spending public money demolishing buildings to avoid this ill thought out stealth tax
7674372 swindon like many other towns across the country could suffer if regeneration projects are shelved as a result of this
7674373 reforms to empty property relief are aimed at ensuring there is a fairer balance between incentives to re let property and giving property managers a period of relief while they manage vacancies
7674374 the main reason given for lifting the ban is that the general public is much more outspoken and broadminded than it was and that to ventilate vice and its tragedies would be to the general social advantage
7674375 the subject will be very distasteful and embarrassing in mixed company of all ages and also that the introduction in plays of new vices might start an unfortunate train of thought in the previously innocent
7674376 for some time the subject of homosexuality has been so widely debated written about that it is no longer justifiable to continue the strict exclusion of this subject from the stage
7674377 we would not pass a play that was violently pro homosexual
7674378 we would not allow funny innuendo or jokes on the subject
7674379 we will not allow embraces between males of practical demonstrations of love
7674380 we will allow the word pansy but not the word bugger
7674381 in terms of censorship of representations of homosexuality it became almost a mania it was as much about latching on to one example of the new permissiveness that developed in the postwar years and seeing in it all the ills of a new world that the retired air force colonels found it hard to understand and instinctively opposed
7674382 it was a time of change but often incremental change and of compromises between old and new guard the old guard was more tenacious than might have been supposed and the new guard was prepared to work within existing systems as well as blazing new ground
7674383 as requested the line worn out but still a few good pumps in her will be omitted
7674384 ive read it and i think its revolting quite apart from the homosexual bits to me it has no saving grace whatsoever if we pass muck like this it does underlined give our critics something to go on
7674385 throughout there runs a rare vitality and with experience and greater conciseness one feels mr pinter may well make some impact as a dramatist
7674386 cannot understand why the younger generation instead of knocking on the door should bash the fuck out of it
7674387 it was as if the theatre were being censored by disgusted of tunbridge wells
7674388 for the third year in a row we have sold in excess of 1 5m tickets
7674389 that is a terrific achievement against a backdrop of the global economic situation an incredibly wet august competition from a fantastic olympic games and of course the problems with the box office system
7674390 i think the box office effect has been the major issue at this years festival i think it has caused a great deal of upset with the public and it has impacted on a proportion of the audience who will have been put off
7674391 i think weve lost the confidence of the public through ticketing and i think it will take a long time to build it up again
7674392 i blame myself for not saving mohammed but where i come from we are not used to this kind of thing happening at home we never need to defend ourselves like that
7674393 after i asked them to leave i noticed a police car pull up outside so i went over and spoke to the officers i asked them to keep an eye on the boys and they said they would then left less than an hour later mohammed who was like a brother to everyone here had been beaten the attack was completely unprovoked and without reason
7674394 this incident will be disastrous for britains relationship with the united arab emirates what parent will want to send their children here for the summer when they know things like this are happening
7674395 we are all deeply shocked at whats happened mohammed was everyones friend we cannot believe something like this could happen we will never come back here
7674396 the young man was a visitor to hastings and his death is tragic our thoughts are with his family
7674397 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7674398 we think it is self rewarding in the sense that the animals get something positive out of doing this
7674399 the only way to explain why you would feel good about doing something for somebody else is if you have some sort of stake in their welfare and thats really what the empathy mechanism is all about
7674400 we are convinced that it is a powerful tool research weve just done involving international choirs and over 12 000 people identified several particular benefits of regular group singing including specific examples of people who say it helped them recover from strokes or heart attacks
7674401 there is an increasing appreciation that the way people feel about themselves is going to have an impact on the budgets of the nhs
7674402 if people are content they are less likely to encounter physical problems
7674403 there is evidence to suggest that in their infirmaries monks used to sing to each other as part of the healing process and other cultures use singing constantly as a means to live
7674404 its an incredible endorphin rush you feel like youve got a spring in your step you feel like youre being totally true to yourself it is like making love in a way youre using your whole body everything is involved
7674405 there is currently a lot of interest in wellbeing and social inclusion and an increasing interest in how music in various forms can support a sense of being part of society and increase your self esteem a great deal of research is being done into music and medicine and how music can ameliorate pain
7674406 theres an excitement you feel part of it singing bonds people and always has done theres a goosebumpy feeling of connection
7674407 but its something that has been lost on a day to day basis
7674408 there is no such thing as not being able to sing its the most natural thing but you can be so conscious of it
7674409 but madeleine helped me not try so hard to be able to sing effortlessly and openly it felt much more a part of me and that carried into my life i felt more confident about being myself
7674410 the point about singing is that it is something we all did when we were born regardless of colour creed or anything else
7674411 all the billions of us on the planet sang and for the first nine months of our lives relied on the manipulation of our voices pitch to meet our basic and fundamental needs
7674412 even if a person does it only once a month it makes an extraordinary difference
7674413 in ancient china doctors added gold flake to drinks for its reputed health benefits and it is still widely used in some aspects of indian ayurvedic medicine
7674414 intramuscular gold injections are sometimes used to treat patients because they can reduce swelling stiffness and pain
7674415 this improved accuracy allows for a more precise radiation dose and a more targeted area for radiotherapy
7674416 these very potent anti cancer drugs are being attached to gold particles which then preferentially locate to a tumour in the body
7674417 it is highly focused so whereas normal chemotherapy would kill healthy cells as well as the diseased ones this method targets just the cancerous cells
7674418 several types of frequently used chemotherapy drugs are derived from platinum
7674419 our scientists helped develop the platinum based drugs carboplatin and cisplatin two of the most successful anti cancer treatments for lung testicular ovarian and head and neck cancer
7674420 now it is being introduced to hundreds of uk hospitals including university college london hospital uclh birmingham hospital and the royal orthopaedic hospital
7674421 many hospitals are already using them so when you open a door or use a hand dryer it could well have reduced levels of bacteria and a lower risk of contamination
7674422 we have no need to consume it in the diet
7674423 it is appropriate to proceed on the basis that apras statement of facts and contentions in so far as it sought to impugn mr abbotts conduct
7674424 these people are considered dangerous and could possibly be armed so we are asking the public please do not approach them
7674425 the minute i heard about it i knew that i and no one else would play him
7674426 less than five minutes you know the mossad works quickly
7674427 within less than an hour they called and asked how soon i could be in london
7674428 i wasnt interested in recreating his every gesture and i didnt impersonate saddams voice which was very high pitched like kermit the frog
7674429 you dont find many opportunities to play someone that you know is you perfectly you the soul the essence we share it me and him i was astonished to realise that but playing him i felt that everything he did was exactly what i would do if i were in his place
7674430 it is something that is connected with childhood with pains that you have in your first years
7674431 iraqi grandmothers are obsessively clean and so i always wanted to wash my hands at kindergarten
7674432 i thought i dont speak the language i dont belong to you and life is a fight a struggle and you have to change the world
7674433 sometimes you realise that the biggest revolutionaries just wanted to change something in their childhood that was painful and saddam was a socialist revolutionary in the beginning he did many great things for his country at first like building a health system education and nationalising oil revenues and then he took the country to war with iran and destroyed everything
7674434 when you hear his name you immediately instinctively connect it with evil a murderer craziness and so on
7674435 if i played him only as that i would just be fulfilling peoples expectations and thats not interesting
7674436 my role was to build tension between the intention of the writers and my own performance
7674437 so as saddam i believe every word i say and i believe every terrible thing i do is for the good of the nation and every mistake i make is because i cant do things in any other way because of who i am thats the duty of any actor playing any role but especially this role where there is so much prejudice
7674438 to solve the problem with our brothers the palestinians the biggest problem in the middle east
7674439 just doesnt care they only care about their interests and the people are paying the price with their blood
7674440 i was born in a period of ideology i never liked capitalism i dont like people who think they can invade a country to change the regime or to kill the elected leader
7674441 you are not the judge and not the police of the world who asked you and how dare you and what do you understand about it anyway
7674442 i really know the western game well and i play it
7674443 but i felt at home when i was filming in morocco and tunisia i speak the language i like the food the araq aniseed drink the nargile hookah me and my iraqi friends in israel talk only in arabic when we are together we enjoy it there is a lot of humour and nuances that we can never express in hebrew
7674444 i wont do roles that are just an arab with nothing interesting about it i also just turned down a big role because the script was anti israeli it was coming from a place of hatred
7674445 there is currently a wave of middle eastern films and it will pass anyway my days of big dreams are behind me i am 50 for an iraqi that is beyond retirement
7674446 we had some growing pains then and were going to need some help now
7674447 we can simplify what they do back there much easier
7674448 drivers have always had some broad discretion so discretion is put the darn stuff underneath until we implement or change or improve on the policy
7674449 as far as not being allowed to carry on bags thats not something that greyhound has initiated
7674450 and we discovered an area where the countryside just looks similar to england with oak trees and other familiar locations
7674451 there may be issues with cost and the odd telegraph pole in the background but surely with the technology they have and a bit of camera work this wouldnt be a problem
7674452 fields have been enclosed railways built the english landscape has been completely transformed
7674453 lalberg es diu san filippo neri i est al carrer santa orsola
7674454 its hot in here you know to convert from celsius to fahrenheit you multiply by 1 8 and add 32 and thats your proper temperature in fahrenheit science is the poetry of maths no wait maths is the poetry of science i just worked that out right now heres a song thats about neither of those things in fact its not really about anything of any use to anyone unless you want to fuck a girl with no legs
7674455 w ere all on the liberal wing of the democratic party
7674456 i will make it the law of the land when im president of the united states
7674457 i concluded your professed concern for the institution and the public interest was genuine and admirable
7674458 mccain has the advantage of just being able to say what he thinks
7674459 because this is an opportunity for people to come back out and bring the county to own it again to make it an economically viable county to have a say in the direction of energy
7674460 because it is diverting us from where we really should be putting our thinking and our resources and our funds into these renewable energy sources and to mass transportation and to be creating the electric cars of the future
7674461 the saakashvili economic policy response to the russian 2006 blockage of georgian wine and mineral water was indeed very courageous and successful
7674462 his big blunder over south ossetia risks indeed now prejudicing that major achievement
7674463 the west would be wise to help achieve such an agreement now
7674464 if instead it chooses to blame russia and re arm georgia as american officials are suggesting a new crisis will be inevitable in that case expect the worst
7674465 it sets a very chilling precedent that someone who is brought back gets the book thrown at them
7674466 i think it was a long sentence but it was positive that he got his day in court and got to speak up and say what he believed
7674467 his spirits were relatively good having two war resisters show up at his trial meant a lot to him
7674468 once soldiers are returned to military control it is in the best interest of everyone if there is support for war resisters
7674469 when the united states first attacked iraq i was told by my president that it was because of direct ties to al qaeda and weapons of mass destruction
7674470 new but yet be conservative doesnt conservative require an previous standard definition
7674471 on may 7 2007 kirchick wrote a cheery optimistic column called believe it or not hail mauritania three months later on aug 6 the mauritanian army overthrew the winner of that glorious election
7674472 where you burp where you fart and you fart where you burp
7674473 i bet serena will wear a lot of chunky jewelry because she always wears those simple tees with a pair of skinny jeans and boots
7674474 truthfully that generation the 14 to 18 year olds have kind of taken over
7674475 its all about them the consumer trends the music anywhere from the general trends on the street really gets translated into what women are wearing
7674476 im pretty confident that designers are looking at it its like theyre young beautiful and rich thats totally what those designers are designing for
7674477 a lot of denim high waisted denim and it had the influence of this super chic young girl upper east side that is very elite and privileged
7674478 i just saw a zara window that is totally imitating chuck basss looks from upcoming episodes that have been previewed on the web
7674479 blair is moving in a very art deco feel mirroring the paintings of tamara de lempicka
7674480 and serena feels like a klimt to me chuck bass ed westwick as a young sean connery circa hitchcocks marni
7674481 its unbelievable to me how the headband has made a resurgence
7674482 it goes with the whole preppy thing especially i think you see that on blair
7674483 what i hope that teens watching the show will come away with as far as fashion inspiration is freedom to experiment with proportion color and texture
7674484 jenny is the downtown girl but she doesnt have the money to wear the expensive clothes so she remakes them in her own cool way
7674485 like youre going to see a giant hair bow on blair or youre going to see a micro something
7674486 skinny skinny jeans skinny jacket a cool t shirt underneath
7674487 really well then ill just have to give up shopping
7674488 hmmm no well just have to go back to the old ways
7674489 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7674490 the bottom line from my perspective is the surgery went well
7674491 right now its a rough day for him but everything went well
7674492 he was fixing to be a big part of this team and to go out there on that field and see this kid laying there after what he went through was tough
7674493 we were talking about it this morning you can be out there in one play and it can be over for you just like that
7674494 i talked to cedric the other day and he told me how well hes doing
7674495 were rooting for him and i just cant wait to see him walk through those practice gates
7674496 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7674497 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7674498 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7674499 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7674500 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7674501 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7674502 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7674503 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7674504 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7674505 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7674506 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7674507 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7674508 talk about their life together and building a family grounded in faith and values
7674509 they are an obvious attempt to smear the senators character
7674510 shame on all of us for not helping with the project
7674511 after all he has done for us every man woman and child should have chipped in to build our greatest alaskan ever a home the size of the white house
7674512 most importantly however disclosure of the things of value and the negative repercussions flowing from that disclosure would have threatened the defendants future stream of things of value from veco bill allen and others
7674513 the leader of the opposition has broken off communication with the prime minister for three weeks and this is clearly a sign of noncooperation
7674514 thats always been our intention at the end of the day the government needs to be able to govern but if thats not possible then somebody needs to get a mandate in order to govern
7674515 they came at us last monday with an e mail asking us for a meeting we responded we would get back to them today so we proposed a date
7674516 hes manufacturing some crisis about a dysfunctional parliament they wanted a meeting before the house returns and were proposing to meet before the house returns
7674517 building the b reactor was a feat of engineering genius so too was the construction a testament to the excellence of working americans
7674518 theres an enormous amount of things that can be learned here whether its about or how a nuclear plant works
7674519 we want people to be able to stop in and spend some time here
7674520 we took the bacon down to one day a week
7674521 its just something everyone loves you walk in schools and smell that bacon frying and the kids go crazy
7674522 wouldnt that buttress a class action lawsuit why is edwards taking care of his fat cat bundlers but not reimbursing joe lunchbuckets 100 troubling
7674523 it seems that john edwards is giving much of his money back to the
7674524 this would have been a real scoop if big contributors were getting refunds but little contributors werent after edwards confessed to his affair the true explanation appears to be pretty mundane
7674525 if the candidate drops out after the primaries then all contributions designated for the general election not the primary election then the contributions by law have to be refunded to the contributors if the individual contributor wants a refund of his her donation made for the primary election its up to the discretion of the campaign whether to make the refund
7674526 there might be plenty of trial lawyers that supported john edwards willing to take that class action case
7674527 that takes money from investors and doesnt inform them of all they know

7674530 id like to welcome everyone and thank you all for coming out its time for football looking back i think we had a great camp and i think guys came back in great shape ive said it multiple times but its a credit to our strength and conditioning coaches and our speed coach tom christian they did a great job along with our young men coming into camp prepared i thought it was a very fast paced up tempo physical camp i thought we had great competition we had some jobs that needed to be solidified and as you can see from our depth chart we feel like weve had some guys step up we also feel that through that competition we have the best depth that weve had in a number of years i feel like it was a productive camp and i really felt like we got game week going the right way yesterday we had a good spirited practice last night and really started to turn our focus into game week mentality and our focus on syracuse we hope to have some of those guys back with the exception of drake who will miss the season with a torn acl that was repaired successfully and all things are pointing down a positive road for him as far as our goals it is for us to consistently prepare last season we didnt do that as a football program starting with us as coaches all the way through to the last player that was on the bus getting ready to play our upcoming opponent i felt like we started this week the right way and now the challenge for us is to stick to our values and get prepared for a very hungry football team a team that i believe i saw improve last year on tape and when healthy is as good as anyone we played against last year its going to be a great challenge for us in the opener there are a lot of unknowns for us in terms of two new coordinators and how were going to work through our first game together with a few new starters and new faces same thing for syracuse theyll have a few new faces in their starting lineup and they also have two new coordinators on their side im excited about our four captains our players voted on that and to be a captain at northwestern you really have to embody everything we stand for value wise on offense are two gentlemen who have not only stepped up on the football field but also off the field as academic all big ten players and two young men that are very active in the northwestern community on defense is and our third senior captain a player who has improved every year at northwestern he was injured his senior year in high school and came to our camp and has just stepped up and is as well respected a player as we have on our team then we have voted as our fourth captain coming back from an injury the playmaking ability that brendan has not only at safety but on special teams i believe they are the four right men to represent our program and have done a great job throughout camp thats why we vote for our captains after camp is over as you guys go around our facilities youll see some major improvements since last fall were just wrapping up our weight room that is completely renovated and second to none in the big ten conference while we were away at camp we had improvements to our meeting room facilities to help our teaching environment for players and coaches as you move over to our indoor practice facility youll see the astroturf playing surface is being ripped up and hopefully by next sunday well have a new fieldturf all weather practice facility which will help keep our players healthier last and most significant to our players is a players lounge in our locker room that theyve been taking advantage of four things that go directly to our players not only currently but for recruiting as well that we are excited about
7674531 theres a lot of unknown going into an opener regardless of whether there is a new coordinator or not you go through the whole off season with new personnel and typically teams will fit their formations and plays to their personnel based on the track record of mitch in the big ten at minnesota both for me and defensive coordinator mike hankwitz experience against him were going to look at what mitch has done in the past and take a look at what syracuses personnel has done in the past theres a lot more on our defenses plate this week our plan will be solid and our guys have been doing some double duty watching syracuse film and minnesota film from 2006
7674532 well our focus is solely on ourselves and preparing for syracuse and i think all our players would echo those sentiments come 11 a m on saturday our focus has to be solely on syracuse its important that you take what youve done in the off season in the opener you need to have your actions reflect your words well take this week to have a physical practice and focus on situations that we think will be critical to the game well be prepared
7674533 jeremy had a great camp and came in in great shape he was a quarterback in high school and his father is an athletic director so he is sort of a gym rat hes just been competitive we have great depth there and through roughly 20 practices he earned a role hell be very active on special teams he has good ball skills and great savvy on the field were excited to have him compete for a job
7674534 we wanted to improve fundamentally and technically we wanted to be better tacklers on defense and we wanted to take better angles in playing team defense the only way you can do that is to put our guys in as many game situations as we can on offense we wanted to solidify up front solidify our ability to run the football and give confidence not only to the young men who might go out and start the syracuse game but also who is next i felt like we needed to do that through the physical nature of practice as we did in the spring i thought we were smart and the only injury we had coming out of camp during live reps was drake dunsmore which was a non contact drill it was probably our most physical camp since ive been the head coach
7674535 we have great depth in the secondary we recruited well last year and red shirted most of those players you see jordan mabin david arnold brian peters and mike bolden across the board as our backups youll see them play not only in the secondary but on special teams to start the year we have great competition there im excited for david oredugba who isnt listed in the two deep we have a good group of five dbs who can play in different packages and be active in special teams
7674536 they have good experience up front and the nature that mitch browning goes about running the football theyre going to be a downhill attacking running team and they have good complements to play action and take their shots deep they have good balance and formation adjustments i told the team probably our third objective for the game is to plan to adjust you go to an opener with no empirical data from a film standpoint of what a team will do until a few series into the game on defense arthur jones jumps out to me hes an all league player in the big east and a big active player at linebacker i like the way jake flaherty plays hes a downhill aggressive runner and they have great competition in the secondary where they will play a lot of players they have all league candidates in the kicking game so that will be a great challenge the guy that jumped out to me and took me aback because he changed numbers is max suter he used to be 48 and is now 24 so on the tape i kept asking who is this guy i was hoping he graduated but unfortunately he just changed numbers they have great special teams and well have our hands full
7674537 i hope as we move forward there will be a lot of strengths that ill talk about but our areas of improvement were tackling better playing better team defense and make sure that if we do have a guy out of a gap that we fill in for him and stick together through adversity on the field offensively we want to run the football better and have more balance but at the same time put our guys in the best formations to execute plays that we think are our strength our first challenge and test will be this saturday guys are excited you go through the whole off season for 13 opportunities and our focus is solely on our preparation and how well adjust to what syracuse does against us
7674538 i think our fans shouldnt read the internet as much our focus is on ourselves with two new coordinators and a handful of new starters and the wrinkles that syracuse we have that we cant see on tape before the opener if we get distracted by anything else wed get exactly what we deserve at 11 a m on saturday well make sure our guys are ready and we wont worry about anything being said on the internet or anywhere else outside of our football family it beats being predicted 0 9 though ill say that
7674539 you need to play to win were not going to run everything because syracuse will take things away schematically that we cannot run at the same time we need to go out and do what we do best and execute stick together this team hasnt faced too much adversity since weve been together in january and our first big test will be saturday you try to put them in those situations in practice but at the end of the day theres nothing like a game to experience adversity that will happen saturday and how we respond and how we stick to our values will determine our success or failure
7674540 early when we first got into full pads we did some live drills where he was very active and as camp kind of tapered toward the end we limited the full contact with not only tyrell but also those two young men have played a lot of football and been through a lot of battles its been a physical camp but both are 100 percent both had great summers and came into camp in great shape thanks to the way we practice and the way we go about our business both are in great shape for great senior years
7674541 when you rewind back to spring practice the nuances and the communication factors were difficult but then they go through it on their own during the summer and i think we had great retention from spring practice thats the way that they worked together through the summer and that gave us a chance to throw a lot at them the first few practices our guys responded well and thats a sign of a veteran team you think about having back at punter hes a true sophomore and this wont be his first go around same with long snapper kyle daley theyve been through a lot of big ten battles so were excited about all of those guys
7674542 hes had a great camp and been right around 100 percent in practice give or take a couple here and there hes coming off an injury that he had to rehab from but he was booming them last night he had one of his best days of camp last night was probably our best day for specialists so far this year
7674543 we took the bacon down to one day a week

7674546 i was probably the most visible hillary supporter there was
7674547 she didnt win i can accept that and i think most people are accepting that
7674548 bottom line we as a party cant afford another bush kind of term
7674549 i liked hillary i saw what she went through with the republicans and she didnt cave in
7674550 but i am not about to vote republican because she isnt the nominee

7674577 you have a large group of the population getting to the age where they are sort of vulnerable to degenerative neurological diseases that seem to be prevalent
7674578 melanoma is the only cancer that is growing at this high rate

7674589 we had two choices either raise our prices to new york residents or give up our new york affiliate business
7674590 and since our affiliates make up such a small fraction of our business cutting affiliates made the most sense
7674591 there are serious issues that have been accumulating including ethnic problems in tibet and xinjiang as well as social issues and conflicts that have been temporarily covered up by force to guarantee a successful olympics
7674592 i cannot predict whether there will be an immediate outbreak of all these problems after the olympics but there will be an outbreak if the government does not take steps to tackle the domestic problems
7674593 the pressure is building in the pressure cooker and theres no current avenue for it to be released i believe we will see many calls both inside and outside the party to put some sort of reforms on the agenda again

7674614 abortion hurts women there is hope and healing at the alpha center this ad has come under fire by opponents to the
7674615 my name is kimberly martinez and i am the executive director for the alpha center of sioux falls i would like to take this time to discuss the alpha center ad that was placed in the sioux falls school directory through the shopping news this school year i will begin first by clarifying one issue the alpha center is a 501c3 non profit organization that has served the tri state area for over 24 years the alpha center is not the political organization that deals with this issue voteyesforlife com is the ad we placed in the sioux falls school directory is in no way political the alpha center was founded 24 years ago for two very specific purposes first to help women whove had an abortion to find healing from the emotional after effects of the procedure second to help pregnant women considering an abortion to understand that there are positive alternatives to abortion like parenting and adoption the message of the alpha center in regards to these services has not changed in 24 years we have clearly acknowledged the pain of abortion in many of our pamphlets and ads throughout these years as we did in the ad being discussed those opposed to the yes on initiated measure 11 campaign are making this a political issue regardless the alpha center has maintained a relationship with the sioux falls school district by providing education for teens on teen pregnancy and other high risk behaviors as long as we censored words like abortion and marriage when we became aware of this advertising opportunity we made the decision to take advantage of it after recognizing two significant factors first we understood that the other ads in the directory would be geared primarily at parents and second the alpha center has seen a significant increase in the number of middle aged women coming to the alpha center for help after a past abortion the reality is the alpha center saw a growing need in our community and saw this ad as an opportunity to reach those needing our services while many of our opponents disagree with the fact that abortion hurts women or they disagree with the placement of this ad i hold strongly that placing this ad was the right thing for alpha center to do we have already had two women contact us specifically because of this ad for help with emotional and physical issues after their past abortion further the purpose of this ad was not to tell anyone how to vote on this issue or any other it was our goal to provide services to those in our community who need our help as we have for 24 years i would also like to acknowledge that the sioux falls school district has been put in a very public spotlight because of this ad by those who oppose the yes on initiated measure 11 campaign in fact an organized effort to call the sioux falls school district in opposition to this ad was emailed and blogged from planned parenthood and others of like mind i hope that the sioux falls school district will see this for what it is an attempt by a political organization to bully them in an effort to raise public awareness of their issue lastly for those parents represented here tonight who state they might disagree with the placement of this ad or with the message of the ad as a whole i wholeheartedly understand the sensitivity of this issue and know you will recognize that this is a directory geared primarily at parents and we are an organization trying to serve a growing number of sioux falls mothers who are asking for help dealing with emotional trauma after a past abortion it is not a derogatory ad nor an obscene ad but rather an informational ad for women to know where they can find help further as you and i and others in this community send our youth to school to be educated i think we can all agree that it is the important issues of our day like this that allow us unique opportunities to educate our children thats why we find newspapers magazines and other similar materials that discuss todays issues available to children in the schools the content of these publications are not censored and are targeted directly to youth to utilize for research and reports a school directory targeted to the parents of our youth should not be censored thank you to the sioux falls school board members and those in the audience for your time

7674618 it has been brought to our attention that there were some images of the band that were banned from myspace because we are an all ages family friendly venue we pride ourselves on providing a positive atmosphere for the kids that come in to see shows unfortunately because of those images and the lyrics to the songs we have found there is no way you guys will be able to meet those guidelines
7674619 everyones been getting word that were crazy and our fans are even crazier
7674620 were pros were not out to kill anyone there are some promoters who have refused to book us because of the type of music we play and how crazy we can make our fans
7674621 it was a very nice christian venue so with the content of those banned photos i could see why they initially had a problem with us it was because of our fans though that they were willing to listen to us and we ended up playing the show after all
7674622 maybe its time to start living up to peoples expectations and become a truly deadly band
7674623 if people think that were going to go out and chop up some girls like pieces of meat like in those pictures maybe we should just start murdering people on stage thatll show em

7674654 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7674655 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7674656 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7674657 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7674658 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7674659 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7674660 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7674661 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7674662 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
7674663 they are an obvious attempt to smear the senators character
7674664 shame on all of us for not helping with the project

7674703 around that week it would be wonderful to have a back to the kempsey showground week cr hayes said
7674704 it was great i mean just for him to be in the olympics was beyond his wildest dreams but to come away with two bronze medals made it even sweeter
7674705 all the aussie swimmers swam so well we were proud just to be a part of it
7674706 they were really happy with the swim and were jumping up and down when they saw the time but then they realised they had come second
7674707 he knew it was going to be tough and that he probably had to swim a pb just to make the semi
7674708 he was disappointed at not making the final but when we spoke to him after he said he was happy with making the semi and that hed done what he could
7674709 he knew he was an outside chance of making the relay teams so he kept training hard in the freestyle events
7674710 when he went to the trials he finished fourth in the 100m which was enough to gain him a berth but he really wanted to make it through as an individual swimmer and then he won the medley and i thought thats his berth again

7674718 i think i would term this addition through subtraction for monsanto

7674755 the second amendment is just one focus in protecting constitutional rights my focus will also be on protecting montanans from criminals providing tools to law enforcement agencies and developing natural resources
7674756 steve bullock and the democrats are weak when it comes to the second amendment and they want to make cartoon jokes about the issue because they are so weak
7674757 i thought he was a really cool person and this was way before he was even a presidential candidate and i liked him a lot
7674758 he invited me to washington and i went we talked about boxing were both boxing fanatics the cool thing about mccain is that the same guy that was senator is the same guy who is running for president now when i talked to him i never felt beneath him he looks directly at me when hes speaking to me and we have the same level of respect for each other
7674759 he said yankee i was a soldier and i saw people die next to me latinos who never got their citizenship but who were willing to die for this country i saw a hernandez i saw a rodriguez how they killed them and that broke my heart hearing that and i went man this guy lived it hes not just going hey i want your vote he lived it
7674760 i was surprised i have to say at how willing to listen he is people who havent met him might get the wrong perception of him but hes totally different

7674763 rodney moore has been in the industry since 1992 so he understands that to be successful it takes running ones business as a business he also understands the importance of supporting industry associations since such associations keep the best interest of the industry
7674764 rodney became an asacp member over three years ago and has increased his support by becoming a corporate sponsor he has continually supported asacp efforts to protect children with its child pornography reporting hotline and its restricted to adults rta website label asacp is honored to have this industry leader included among its sponsors
7674765 its unfortunate that many uninformed and biased people automatically equate adult video with child pornography the fact is that nobody i know or have ever encountered in the adult industry would ever have anything even remotely to do with that
7674766 when you hear or read about people being arrested for possession or distribution of child pornography its always someone with a mainstream job never ever someone in the adult business in addition to helping to fight child pornography asacp helps to educate people to the truth about our industry and how we feel as strongly as anyone that child pornography is wrong and should be fought
7674767 we made it really clear that when we recruit new industry we make sure were not recruiting someone who will be a challenge for other businesses
7674768 we will have to do an analysis of the business plan to make sure nothing poses an unfair advantage over private sector companies
7674769 were not relying simply on those folks who were there before
7674770 but im confident we know how to get a hold of them some of them have stayed in touch with us

7674773 theres an enormous amount of things that can be learned here whether its about enrico fermi the history of nuclear energy or how a nuclear plant works
7674774 we want people to be able to stop in and spend some time here thats our ultimate goal

7674779 the vendors set up from 7 a m to 9 a m and we could really use extra hands then
7674780 then of course we need people to help us reverse things when the day starts to wind down
7674781 i know theres a whole lot more good people there than bad ones
7674782 i want to do all i can to get that message out if it takes me until my last breath
7674783 two of the goals of plan are to develop community pride and investment worthiness here
7674784 we think the festival speaks to both of those goals we want to highlight the best of whats in duffyfield sometimes what you hear about duffyfield in the news is not the reality of how much good there is
7674785 yes its violent we dont try to hide that but as publishers we see it as a fantasy game its fantasy violence its over the top its cartoony we also take the violence very seriously we are working with the age rating boards with pegi and with bbfc

7674789 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7674790 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7674791 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7674792 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7674793 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7674794 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7674795 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7674796 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7674797 talk about their life together and building a family grounded in faith and values
7674798 it would be great if i could holler at phelps

7674803 there are four characteristics which brand a country unmistakably as a dictatorship one party rule executions without trial or with a mock trial for political offenses the nationalization or expropriation of private property and censorship a country guilty of these outrages forfeits any moral prerogatives any claim to national rights or sovereignty and becomes an outlaw
7674804 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7674805 i know this is not coming from barack obama but his supporters are helping us decide who to vote for
7674806 i hate the feeling that you shouldnt wear your hillary gear unless there are two or three of you together

7674818 y ouve been oneof the clinton supporters that have been very vocal very unhappy about the way sen barack obama treated sen hillary clinton
7674819 no i think i was more fair to the clintons
7674820 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
7674821 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
7674822 you can play through the entire game without killing anything
7674823 its very challenging but its also very beneficial when the game initializes the relationships of other creatures or tribes or civilizations for the next level many of those relationships have to do with how aggressive those creatures perceive you to be
7674824 we werent thinking of the sims as a brand we were thinking of it as an offbeat computer game with spore we had the confidence that the players would always exceed our expectations if we gave them more creative control from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand
7674825 you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined
7674826 spore on almost any platform is going to be different and tied to the unique aspects of that platform
7674827 sitting in front of a console is very different from sitting in front of a pc whether youre using a mouse or a ps3 controller or a wii wand that right off the bat is arguing for a somewhat different design
7674828 i dont think we could design a sequel to spore until the fans showed us what they like
7674829 i think theres going to be a fair amount of learning over the next few months whats important for me is what sort of stories the players are using the game to tell games that have the longest legs are the ones with the most narrative density
7674830 we could have finished up to fourth and were going to finish whatever it is 10th or 11th so therefore thats a failure
7674831 to a man with a hammer everything looks like a nail
7674832 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7674833 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7674834 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7674835 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7674836 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7674837 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7674838 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7674839 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7674840 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7674841 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
7674842 gas prices have nearly doubled we are doing everything we can to conserve we did put in for a considerably higher request this year than what we have in years past
7674843 but obama threw him under the bus when he needed the votes

7674848 we had a good season and pulled out some great victories
7674849 i think it is definitely going to give us motivation for this season as we realized last year winning the regular season is not enough to put you in the ncaa tournament and that is our ultimate goal
7674850 i dont feel a lot of pressure on my shoulders this year i just try and show the way for the younger girls and be a good example
7674851 i have been a part of a winning team since i got here and we want to win conference again and also win the mountain west conference tournament
7674852 i want to end my career here with no regrets
7674853 i think we have a lot more depth on the bench this year with the forwards and the midfielders
7674854 we have a lot of new faces coming in and we have some quality players that are already here so we have the talent
7674855 its just the matter of coming together as a team
7674856 the use of this image is in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7674857 we have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported and we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we dont have to worry about
7674858 black youths within this country have been left to die and thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7674859 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
7674860 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

7674870 hes very committed to helping working class folks and poor people and thats what catholic social teaching is all about
7674871 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7674872 im a practicing catholic and it is the biggest dilemma for me in terms of comporting my religious and cultural views with my political responsibility
7674873 the only means by which in this heterogeneous society of ours we can reach some general accommodation on what is a religiously charged and publicly charged debate
7674874 biden has opposed government funding for abortion so basically he doesnt want to put women and doctors in jail he doesnt want to criminalize abortions but nor does he want the government to pay for them

7674882 westwick this weekend we have to run their names together because its impossible to separate the real person from the both so pompous and charming at the same time
7674883 my style has always been good top notch baby i like the glamorous indie rock look like the libertines but you know without the heroin needle sticking out of my arm
7674884 if i want to go out and drink and throw a glass in the street ill do it as long as the reason is that i want to have fun and not that i want to create some sort of tension around me then id be a d k but im not
7674885 people think chace is gay and thought i was gay that we were humping its not true but hilarious people project their fantasies onto people ive never been someone who makes it my objective to go out and pick up chicks but ive met some fantastic ladies here you know those amazing conversations where you find yourself in a cafe talking until 2 a m and never see them again
7674886 i love going out in the summer the girls wear their nice dresses did that sound sleazy it really did didnt it put it like this everyone comes out looking gorgeous in summer we are a more beautiful species in the summer
7674887 50 minutes of fame 50 minutes the best house electro and latinhouse tracks in the mix
7674888 no s si ser cierto pero por las dudas yo lo reenv o
7674889 i just thought that the handprint was one of the most dignified images that i could find the most simple image of innocence absorbed in all that pain
7674890 the minute i heard about it i knew that i and no one else would play him
7674891 less than five minutes you know the mossad works quickly
7674892 within less than an hour they called and asked how soon i could be in london
7674893 i wasnt interested in recreating his every gesture and i didnt impersonate saddams voice which was very high pitched like kermit the frog
7674894 you dont find many opportunities to play someone that you know is you perfectly you the soul the essence we share it me and him i was astonished to realise that but playing him i felt that everything he did was exactly what i would do if i were in his place
7674895 it is something that is connected with childhood with pains that you have in your first years
7674896 iraqi grandmothers are obsessively clean and so i always wanted to wash my hands at kindergarten
7674897 i thought i dont speak the language i dont belong to you and life is a fight a struggle and you have to change the world
7674898 sometimes you realise that the biggest revolutionaries just wanted to change something in their childhood that was painful and saddam was a socialist revolutionary in the beginning he did many great things for his country at first like building a health system education and nationalising oil revenues and then he took the country to war with iran and destroyed everything
7674899 when you hear his name you immediately instinctively connect it with evil a murderer craziness and so on
7674900 if i played him only as that i would just be fulfilling peoples expectations and thats not interesting
7674901 my role was to build tension between the intention of the writers and my own performance
7674902 so as saddam i believe every word i say and i believe every terrible thing i do is for the good of the nation and every mistake i make is because i cant do things in any other way because of who i am thats the duty of any actor playing any role but especially this role where there is so much prejudice
7674903 to solve the problem with our brothers the palestinians the biggest problem in the middle east
7674904 just doesnt care they only care about their interests and the people are paying the price with their blood
7674905 i was born in a period of ideology i never liked capitalism i dont like people who think they can invade a country to change the regime or to kill the elected leader
7674906 you are not the judge and not the police of the world who asked you and how dare you and what do you understand about it anyway
7674907 i really know the western game well and i play it
7674908 but i felt at home when i was filming in morocco and tunisia i speak the language i like the food the araq aniseed drink the nargile hookah me and my iraqi friends in israel talk only in arabic when we are together we enjoy it there is a lot of humour and nuances that we can never express in hebrew
7674909 i wont do roles that are just an arab with nothing interesting about it i also just turned down a big role because the script was anti israeli it was coming from a place of hatred
7674910 there is currently a wave of middle eastern films and it will pass anyway my days of big dreams are behind me i am 50 for an iraqi that is beyond retirement
7674911 in america they know me as the guy who did faith
7674912 the main reason given for lifting the ban is that the general public is much more outspoken and broadminded than it was and that to ventilate vice and its tragedies would be to the general social advantage
7674913 the subject will be very distasteful and embarrassing in mixed company of all ages and also that the introduction in plays of new vices might start an unfortunate train of thought in the previously innocent
7674914 for some time the subject of homosexuality has been so widely debated written about that it is no longer justifiable to continue the strict exclusion of this subject from the stage
7674915 we would not pass a play that was violently pro homosexual
7674916 we would not allow funny innuendo or jokes on the subject
7674917 we will not allow embraces between males of practical demonstrations of love
7674918 we will allow the word pansy but not the word bugger
7674919 in terms of censorship of representations of homosexuality it became almost a mania it was as much about latching on to one example of the new permissiveness that developed in the postwar years and seeing in it all the ills of a new world that the retired air force colonels found it hard to understand and instinctively opposed
7674920 it was a time of change but often incremental change and of compromises between old and new guard the old guard was more tenacious than might have been supposed and the new guard was prepared to work within existing systems as well as blazing new ground
7674921 as requested the line worn out but still a few good pumps in her will be omitted
7674922 ive read it and i think its revolting quite apart from the homosexual bits to me it has no saving grace whatsoever if we pass muck like this it does underlined give our critics something to go on
7674923 throughout there runs a rare vitality and with experience and greater conciseness one feels mr pinter may well make some impact as a dramatist
7674924 cannot understand why the younger generation instead of knocking on the door should bash the fuck out of it
7674925 it was as if the theatre were being censored by disgusted of tunbridge wells

7674927 oh my g d that is the coolest person alive
7674928 the bottom line from my perspective is the surgery went well
7674929 right now its a rough day for him but everything went well
7674930 he was fixing to be a big part of this team and to go out there on that field and see this kid laying there after what he went through was tough
7674931 we were talking about it this morning you can be out there in one play and it can be over for you just like that
7674932 i talked to cedric the other day and he told me how well hes doing
7674933 were rooting for him and i just cant wait to see him walk through those practice gates

7674935 despite the best efforts of all of us the star ledger is losing a battle to survive
7674936 if the ledger is to have a future it must make further changes in how it operates

7674939 drop when the golf world discovers how well this particular putter drains
7674940 our objective is to create a soft 50 compression ball that would compress enough at impact to deliver a 100 performance and i believe we have accomplished that
7674941 when men and women with slower swing speeds hit the karma they will immediately feel how soft it is and see how well it carries
7674942 when golfers need more good karma to carry it over a lake bunker or any other obstacle that can get in the way of a good shot the karma ball will provide them with renewed confidence with its new 312 dimple design that delivers high trajectory
7674943 the karma ball also includes a unique and distinctive face stamp graphic distancing itself from any other ball in the market
7674944 consciously has packaged the karma ball with 50 recycled content
7674945 after working in the clinton administration in the department of commerce on internet privacy and online commerce issues hunter consulted for five years as an expert on these very same issues at a time of enormous expansion in online banking
7674946 he was not a lobbyist for mbna and his work had absolutely nothing to do with the bankruptcy bill zero nothing

7674948 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill
7674949 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq leadership and supporters and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
7674950 they are not heroes and dont have answers and that they harm you your country and your livelihood
7674951 it is aimed primarily but not exclusively at those working with overseas influencers and opinion formers
7674952 use advisedly avoid suggesting that aq is no longer a threat we are not claiming victory over aq we are stressing their declining support
7674953 on the defensive throughout much of the rest of the world
7674954 feed its new franchises with propaganda to keep the brand alive at all costs
7674955 on how best to tailor such material for media engagements presenting information to ministers or to other stakeholders it is in a separate unclassified format to make it the sort of product that a minister or a press officer could use before an interview or that could be given as a crib sheet for trusted contacts
7674956 i just thought that the handprint was one of the most dignified images that i could find the most simple image of innocence absorbed in all that pain
7674957 one hundred and forty nine thousand head of cattle so youre looking at 1 040 trucks the equivalent of 22 triple road trains of livestock leaving the boulia shire every day
7674958 normal carrying capacity for the shire is 184 000 and the current stocking numbers are 35 000 its pretty devastating the numbers that have gone out
7674959 like properties that could carry 9 000 are down to 1 200 and then youve got the smaller operations that are totally de stocked you know theyll run 2 000 or 3 000 head they havent got a beast left on them
7674960 we want to keep them so people can go and look and see how the people lived the size of the hut and the room
7674961 well make a self guided walk so people can go in look and learn about the history of the small fruit industry
7674962 you look inside them and you can its hard to imagine how a whole family mum dad and kids all lived in those what are effectively two roomed huts
7674963 you would not leave your windows and doors unlocked when you go out for fear of being burgled but by failing to adequately protect yourself when using wireless internet access you are doing just that an opportunist could potentially intercept any data you send and receive get access to your wireless network and hijack your internet access
7674964 furthermore you may have protected your wireless network at home but if you use your laptop to access the internet in a wireless hotspot located in hotel airport or caf for example you cannot be sure of the same level of security best practice for all home pc and laptop users is to follow the five steps and implement an all in one security solution including a two way firewall
7674965 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives

7674972 our quarterbacks i have great confidence in all three of them to be honest with you and i cant tell you today wholl take the field first
7674973 i can tell you ill be comfortable with whoever that is
7674974 i would not be surprised if all three quarterbacks played at certain times
7674975 whatever the coach thinks is best we trust coach miles completely in our preparation
7674976 however hes going to handle it im sure will be best for the team and on an individual basis im just focusing on my job and working hard each day
7674977 its screwed us up a couple of times and finally we got the hang of it
7674978 hes a great quarterback and we figure if we can do well against our offense we can do well against any offense
7674979 theres some talent there they just needed the experience at the end of the year we were a pretty darn good defense
7674980 weve got to get the offense the ball if we dont get the coverage we really dont mind
7674981 it was the first start for a lot of guys last year the atmosphere and the whole st louis thing
7674982 guys were just a little nervous and thats how it happened
7674983 well come out there this year and try to finish the game
7674984 you cant compromise product safety and integrity for any good reason
7674985 what we would hope to do is that we might be able to identify that theres only a small portion of the river thats suffering this problem
7674986 our studies in mice showed that we could selectively kill the defective autoimmune cells that were destroying insulin producing islets
7674987 these results show that the same selective destruction can occur in human cells and connect what we saw in our animal studies with the protocol we are pursuing in our phase i clinical trial
7674988 evidence is still required as to how long this is effective as a treatment in humans and we look forward to seeing the next stage of trials

7674997 there may be issues with cost and the odd telegraph pole in the background but surely with the technology they have and a bit of camera work this wouldnt be a problem
7674998 fields have been enclosed railways built the english landscape has been completely transformed
7674999 weve resolved that its not the role of the thoroughbred breeders itself to take any legal action in relation to the equine influenza incursion last year
7675000 thats really up to the breeders themselves who may have suffered losses and theres plenty of those i can add
7675001 the worst thing you can be in this industry is a middle class white male
7675002 the minute i heard about it i knew that i and no one else would play him
7675003 less than five minutes you know the mossad works quickly
7675004 within less than an hour they called and asked how soon i could be in london

7675023 a strong line of enquiry is that young children aged under five somehow managed to access the air weapon and accidentally caused it to go off

7675027 the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7675028 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rear view mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7675029 were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7675030 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7675031 because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7675032 truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7675033 had not yet achieved the complete reconciliation that we need
7675034 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us
7675035 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7675036 senator mccain will bring a lifetime of experience to the campaign i will bring a lifetime of experience and senator obama will bring a speech he gave in 2002
7675037 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7675038 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7675039 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
7675040 funny all the righteous indignation and caustic language towards a shamed and apologetic john edwards john mccain has had far more affairs
7675041 it is very unlikely that any jefferson other than thomas jefferson was the father of hemingss six children
7675042 arkansas needs to affirm the importance of married mothers and fathers
7675043 we need to publicly affirm the gold standard of rearing children whenever we can the state standard should be as close to that gold standard of married mom and dad homes as possible
7675044 were going to work very hard to defeat this because it is just bad policy for children
7675045 im just going to stay in my house and watch out for it
7675046 russias historic role of the guarantor of peace in the caucasus has increased
7675047 the caucasus has always been and will remain the zone of russias strategic interests
7675048 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7675049 we are hoping to resolve this situation peacefully and if that doesnt work out there are other methods
7675050 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7675051 i know this is not coming from barack obama but his supporters are helping us decide who to vote for
7675052 i hate the feeling that you shouldnt wear your hillary gear unless there are two or three of you together
7675053 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7675054 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7675055 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7675056 ich drehe auch filme ber frauen weil ich mitleid mit ihnen habe
7675057 were looking at it as a gang related shooting right now
7675058 i guess its just the wrong people being up in here at the right time
7675059 were going to go out and kill the ant with a sledgehammer
7675060 thats what were going to try to do were going to go out and win big theres a lot of eyes on us right and thats why we have that mentality about the ant and the sledgehammer were just going to try to obliterate teams
7675061 we expect these players to play at a higher level and to perform and execute at a higher level
7675062 i think everyone is anxious to get the year started
7675063 you can only go so many days practicing against yourself before you start to find out if youre actually making any progress as a football team
7675064 what role does religious faith tm play in your life with all of the persons of faith stuff being tossed around in the public arena these days it makes me wonder what role faith or lack thereof may play in shakers lives
7675065 i dont think ive seen so many committees loaded for bear in my life
7675066 how about i call you at 2 am and ask you the same thing
7675067 sales volume is starting to increase because prices are collapsing
7675068 when lenders are aggressive enough on pricing especially in certain markets its enough to attract buying interest
7675069 home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
7675070 still inventory remains high in many parts of the country and will require time to fully absorb
7675071 the troubling thing about this report is that the supply issue is not going away
7675072 it would be okay as long as the inventory went down but there were enough new listings that overall supply rose more than sales
7675073 this report illustrates a housing market thats going to continue to struggle
7675074 shes the best stepmom sam lola and cassandra could ever hope for seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mom unless i bat 100 percent perhaps a boy awaits us
7675075 i saw when the judges blatantly stole fights from two cuban boxers in the semifinals
7675076 our fighters had hopes of winning despite the judges but it was useless they were condemned beforehand
7675077 every discipline every human and material resource that we dedicate to sport
7675078 given the focus of presidential campaigns on health care reform it seems this would be a good time to address high cost of care and the problem of not having insurance
7675079 the cost of covering the insured will be more expensive if we continue to wait
7675080 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7675081 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7675082 i know that we had a tough road ahead of us we knew that these guys werent going to roll over and give up that easily
7675083 so we had to be men and thats what it takes to win
7675084 being a part of the 04 team we really didnt get the opportunity to showcase our talent
7675085 we really wanted to come in and help lead this team
7675086 we knew coming in that spain was going to be a big problem
7675087 it would be speculation for us to say anything about what might have occurred
7675088 we have our ideas with it but again its speculation
7675089 we have a little old lady who walks down to mcdonalds
7675090 no hay ni una sola frase en ninguno de los numerosos escritos que integran el nuevo testamento que en el griego original indique siquiera de manera indirecta que el staur s que se utiliz en el caso de jes s fuera en absoluto diferente del com n y mucho menos que consistiera en dos le os clavados en forma de cruz en vez de uno solo no es peque o desatino de nuestros maestros traducir la palabra staur s por cruz cuando vierten a nuestra lengua vern cula los documentos griegos de la iglesia y respaldar esa traducci n con la inclusi n de cruz en nuestros l xicos entre las acepciones de staur s sin explicar que ese de ning n modo era el significado original del vocablo en los d as de los ap stoles que no adquiri ese significado fundamental hasta mucho despu s y que si lleg a adoptarlo se debi exclusivamente a que por una u otra raz n se asumi que el staur s en el que se ejecut a jes s ten a esa determinada forma pese a no tener la m s m nima prueba de ello

7675092 es extra o y no obstante un hecho incuestionable que en pocas muy anteriores al nacimiento de cristo y desde entonces en tierras no tocadas por las ense anzas de la iglesia la cruz ha sido usada como s mbolo sagrado el baco griego el tamuz tirio el bel caldeo y el od n escandinavo todos fueron simbolizados para sus devotos por un objeto cruciforme
7675093 la cruz en forma de la crux ansata era llevada en la mano de los sacerdotes egipcios y los reyes pont fices como s mbolo de su autoridad como sacerdotes del dios sol y era llamada el signo de la vida

7675103 the same thing weve been hearing from hillary clinton for the past couple of months which is that she supports senator obama as we all do
7675104 we are going to move forward united to change the team thats in the white house
7675105 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7675106 john mccain has a compelling biography he served america with bravery and distinction and he deserves a respect for that but his policies dont deserve respect
7675107 his ideas dont deserve respect because theyre the same old ideas that weve seen out of george bush for the last eight years
7675108 oh aussie i dont know how we survived with out you
7675109 if you have commented on gosmelltheflowers com earlier you will need to
7675110 he was very complimentary of the situation of the organization and appreciated the opportunity to go back to the twins

7675113 it sounds like frankies going to get the first shot at it
7675114 lets see how the next five weeks go id like to see frankie step up and perform in that role and handle it
7675115 hes got his confidence back and were just going to put him in there and let him swing and see how it goes
7675116 i masturbate all the time with my hand a bullet a vibrating penis a glass penis and occasionally with someone watching me

7675122 rather than prematurely writing off the idea its important to critically study municipal networks successes and shortcomings

7675133 you have not contributed enough to this public quest to be allowed to roll

7675135 no an absolute no no to rotation bring in 6 capitols and leave 6 capitols
7675136 we are convinced that it is a powerful tool research weve just done involving international choirs and over 12 000 people identified several particular benefits of regular group singing including specific examples of people who say it helped them recover from strokes or heart attacks
7675137 there is an increasing appreciation that the way people feel about themselves is going to have an impact on the budgets of the nhs
7675138 if people are content they are less likely to encounter physical problems
7675139 there is evidence to suggest that in their infirmaries monks used to sing to each other as part of the healing process and other cultures use singing constantly as a means to live
7675140 its an incredible endorphin rush you feel like youve got a spring in your step you feel like youre being totally true to yourself it is like making love in a way youre using your whole body everything is involved
7675141 there is currently a lot of interest in wellbeing and social inclusion and an increasing interest in how music in various forms can support a sense of being part of society and increase your self esteem a great deal of research is being done into music and medicine and how music can ameliorate pain
7675142 theres an excitement you feel part of it singing bonds people and always has done theres a goosebumpy feeling of connection
7675143 but its something that has been lost on a day to day basis
7675144 there is no such thing as not being able to sing its the most natural thing but you can be so conscious of it
7675145 but madeleine helped me not try so hard to be able to sing effortlessly and openly it felt much more a part of me and that carried into my life i felt more confident about being myself
7675146 the point about singing is that it is something we all did when we were born regardless of colour creed or anything else
7675147 all the billions of us on the planet sang and for the first nine months of our lives relied on the manipulation of our voices pitch to meet our basic and fundamental needs
7675148 even if a person does it only once a month it makes an extraordinary difference
7675149 its a sad indictment of our broken society that so many are turning to things like drug and alcohol abuse at such a young age
7675150 gps claim back from the nhs a standard price for each drug prescribed whatever they have actually paid for it
7675151 there is a lot of pre emptive demolition going on this is already having a visual impact cities are beginning to look like broken teeth
7675152 we are spending public money demolishing buildings to avoid this ill thought out stealth tax
7675153 swindon like many other towns across the country could suffer if regeneration projects are shelved as a result of this
7675154 reforms to empty property relief are aimed at ensuring there is a fairer balance between incentives to re let property and giving property managers a period of relief while they manage vacancies
7675155 in ancient china doctors added gold flake to drinks for its reputed health benefits and it is still widely used in some aspects of indian ayurvedic medicine
7675156 intramuscular gold injections are sometimes used to treat patients because they can reduce swelling stiffness and pain
7675157 this improved accuracy allows for a more precise radiation dose and a more targeted area for radiotherapy
7675158 these very potent anti cancer drugs are being attached to gold particles which then preferentially locate to a tumour in the body
7675159 it is highly focused so whereas normal chemotherapy would kill healthy cells as well as the diseased ones this method targets just the cancerous cells
7675160 several types of frequently used chemotherapy drugs are derived from platinum
7675161 our scientists helped develop the platinum based drugs carboplatin and cisplatin two of the most successful anti cancer treatments for lung testicular ovarian and head and neck cancer
7675162 now it is being introduced to hundreds of uk hospitals including university college london hospital uclh birmingham hospital and the royal orthopaedic hospital
7675163 many hospitals are already using them so when you open a door or use a hand dryer it could well have reduced levels of bacteria and a lower risk of contamination
7675164 we have no need to consume it in the diet
7675165 david twohy right now is writing the scripts the only question is whether we take a page from the lord of the rings guys and try to shoot the two chapters at the same time there are two more in mind
7675166 the chronicles of riddick was presented as a three part trilogy that would answer pitch black in the same way that lord of the rings answered the hobbit
7675167 not only reading and analysing briefs but also virtually knowing them off by heart
7675168 our studies in mice showed that we could selectively kill the defective autoimmune cells that were destroying insulin producing islets
7675169 these results show that the same selective destruction can occur in human cells and connect what we saw in our animal studies with the protocol we are pursuing in our phase i clinical trial
7675170 evidence is still required as to how long this is effective as a treatment in humans and we look forward to seeing the next stage of trials

7675179 etfs are less desirable for bonds anyway since a relatively small portion of a bonds total return is due to capital gains the tax efficiency benefit of bond etfs is relatively trivial
7675180 someone will make money on your funds why not you
7675181 foreign stocks are an unnecessary luxury for most u s investors with the growth of globalization financial markets throughout the world have become increasingly correlated particularly in times of market adversity the higher correlations of foreign markets with the u s market in recent years and the convergence in national economic growth rates reduce the diversification effect of foreign equity investment any remaining cross border diversification effect is probably largely due to currency fluctuations unless your net worth exceeds say 5 million it usually makes sense to ignore foreign securities markets

7675187 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character
7675188 however jacqueline doesnt want to offend her readers or her readers parents so when the book comes to be reprinted the word will be replaced with twit
7675189 everyone was polite and seemed interested but no one offered to raise money to build her
7675190 there are an estimated 18m policies in circulation most of them mis sold
7675191 when i was five i was in the co op one day with my mum and we saw this man
7675192 i said whos that it turned out it was my dad since then ive seen him on sundays when he shows up my mums staying in b amp b in blackpool now but i just want to be with her i love my mum to bits and i miss her i just want her back
7675193 theres something quite fundamental about the culture and approach of an organisation like ours i think at the heart of it is a real focus on the idea of personalisation it strikes me it doesnt matter whether its a private voluntary or statutory entity i think what people are trying to reach for is a model of interacting with young people that operates at that personal level
7675194 i just used to stay in bed all day and get stoned
7675195 all i cared about was where my next joint was coming from
7675196 i was used to mixing with older people they were just like babies themselves i would sit in a classroom and someone would say something and then id say something back and start arguing and then id get emotional and walk out
7675197 prus are very good at getting the right destinations for young people but six months down the line if we check them out how many will still be there
7675198 these young people are more likely to have ongoing crises or critical incidents in their lives which need to be supported what they need is that little bit extra going the extra mile
7675199 for the first time we are being very very proactive about these young people so they can move smoothly into employment and more positive lives
7675200 i dont underestimate the scale of the challenge i know many of these young people come from chaotic lives but they will now be tracked we will know whats happening to them its never too late when there are wonderful voluntary organisations working in the community education is lifelong
7675201 i hate school i just dont like it i dont learn anything at school
7675202 here they dont talk to you like teachers they talk to you like friends
7675203 if i could turn back time i would do it all different
7675204 if i could do it again i wouldnt get stoned every day to be honest with you i didnt really care about my future until now
7675205 the worst thing you can be in this industry is a middle class white male
7675206 data from the youth cohort study shows that the gap in five a c attainment in gcses between highest and lowest social classes was 40 percentage points in 1989 rising to 49 in 1998 and down to 44 by 2004 so you could argue labour is just undoing the damage that the tories did
7675207 there is a good deal of other recently published data that shows that on key indicators the social class gap has reduced slightly since 2004 taken as a whole goves document shows extreme carelessness or disregard for truth and accuracy he is right that inequalities are too high but we need a proper debate about this and what to do about it if he wants to be taken seriously he should withdraw this document and re enter the debate when he has a better grasp of the evidence
7675208 the wrong data was published by the department for children schools and families dcsf and was provided to him in answer to a parliamentary question earlier this year however the data is clearly wrong because the totals differ from the figures given for girls and boys
7675209 millions of pupils have left school with little to show for their education during a decade of persistent failure
7675210 if we look at the percentage figures which take into account the size of cohort and the trend what the data actually shows is that between 1997 and 2007 there was a drop from 6 to 4 in the proportion of pupils not entered for any gcses a drop from 8 to 5 in the proportion not getting above a g in any subject and a drop from 30 to 23 in the proportion not getting above a c in any subject so there is no evidence for a decade of persistent failure
7675211 this is a skewed and partial analysis which reflects an ideological agenda
7675212 all the figures we used were drawn from parliamentary answers or the governments own publicly available statistics others can draw different interpretations from these figures but it is unarguable that the level of educational inequality in england is indefensible
7675213 virtually every initiative the government has taken in this area including london challenge excellence in cities education maintenance allowances aim higher and the reading recovery programmes has been positively evaluated
7675214 but they are only chipping away at the problem effecting real change takes a long time and a great deal of money
7675215 weve got to be prepared to be more radical in how we resource and run schools and in the curriculum we teach
7675216 we always said training was essential but they ask for more training for a man selling lettuce in the market because he has to use a machine than estate agents
7675217 companies who had always focused on web based activities without the massive overheads associated with a network of physical branch offices are the ones more likely to weather the storm
7675218 there is a lot of pre emptive demolition going on this is already having a visual impact cities are beginning to look like broken teeth
7675219 we are spending public money demolishing buildings to avoid this ill thought out stealth tax
7675220 swindon like many other towns across the country could suffer if regeneration projects are shelved as a result of this
7675221 reforms to empty property relief are aimed at ensuring there is a fairer balance between incentives to re let property and giving property managers a period of relief while they manage vacancies
7675222 you run down to the waters edge one small dark spot against the brightness of the sand and sea
7675223 you pick up a clam shell half open and inside a live clam snaps the shell closed
7675224 i got new friends and i already understand what the teachers are saying
7675225 this is the age when they dont know if theyre children or adults
7675226 being held back while their peers are moving on is devastating to them
7675227 at a traditional school its sometimes very difficult for a student to be recognized as an individual by teachers and administrators because of the large number of students who are on our middle school campuses

7675229 this years freshman class will be the largest class in the history of washington state university
7675230 it will also be the best academically prepared class and it is a very diverse class
7675231 i am very very pleased with where we are on the enrollment front
7675232 we are projecting the freshman class will be approximately 3 350
7675233 they are the largest and fastest growing community of color in our state and one of the most difficult to recruit
7675234 we put more modern recruitment methods into place using more direct outreach
7675235 we chose not to invest money in more brochures but instead used that money to bring more students onto campus
7675236 we are very pleased with what we have in place our outreach efforts our modern communication plans and our relationships with high schools and guidance counselors
7675237 wsu has always allowed some alcohol use on campus with the proper permits

7675241 they just made me a floor whip and sent me to give the florida delegation their seats
7675242 but the prime minister has many other commitments so that may not be possible
7675243 the area is very exposed to the falling of seracs towers of ice
7675244 there is no reason to put the lives of rescuers at risk for the sake of recovering the bodies this is no longer an emergency situation
7675245 the expedition had been planned down to the smallest detail there was no negligence the avalanche descended on us and there was nothing we could do to avoid it
7675246 it was a terrible experience until that point the climb had gone beautifully the mountain was enchanting until the arrival of that executioner announced by a sort of creaking like the breaking of a beam then total darkness for several minutes i thought i had been buried in the snow but when it was all over i found i could still breathe im alive i told myself
7675247 every summer 30 000 people climb the mont blanc range
7675248 the refuges are at bursting point the one at gouter you literally cant get into
7675249 before taking their clients up mont blanc guides should find out whether there is room in the refuges
7675250 instead of making their clients sleep on the ice and under canvas at 4 000m they should postpone the expedition
7675251 icefall avalanches can happen any day in the summer and summer climbers need to be more tuned in to them they tend to be on the look out for other hazards like rock falls
7675252 which is not much different to being hit by a rock
7675253 the best way to avoid them is to choose a route that is not exposed to too many seracs in fact the traditional route up mont blanc du tacul was abandoned one reason being that it was far more exposed to icefalls than the one the climbers used on sunday
7675254 they have been for a couple days and probably longer than that we are ready for gameday the coaches are as eager as the players
7675255 we have asked the pentagon to allow a six month timetable for submittal of proposals in this competition

7675257 its time consumers had the advantage of a market economy when it comes to beer
7675258 but just something so they can get to know each other thats important
7675259 kids do still want to know theyre loved that theyre appreciated and that youre going to take time for them
7675260 you dont want to feel like a lone ranger like youre out there on an island
7675261 but weve got a dedicated bunch of people here and were looking forward to making significant progress this year
7675262 i want desire to teach in that kind of challenging situation
7675263 its not just about the speaker but mugabe has lost control of parliament which makes it very difficult to govern
7675264 the majority of people in zimbabwe are saying if you are not in control of the security forces dont sign because it means mugabe can unleash violence whenever he likes
7675265 not only reading and analysing briefs but also virtually knowing them off by heart

7675289 i like mccain a lot a lot and you know things may change along the way but theres something about matching the character with the script and right now the script thats being written and reality sic is pretty brutal and pretty hard edged like a rough action film and you need somebody whos been in that to deal with it
7675290 if god forbid we live to see mr obama president we will live through a socialist era that america has not seen before and our country will be weakened in every way

7675388 our teams in gori are seeing a significant level of damage from the fighting
7675389 not much aid has reached the areas around there so our immediate focus will be to provide the basics once those needs are met we will look ahead to the recovery process and paving the way for a peaceful reconciliation among people on all sides of the conflict
7675390 but each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey i come here tonight as a sister blessed with a brother who is my mentor my protector and my lifelong friend i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion and her intelligence reflected in my own daughters
7675391 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7675392 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love

7675396 of course it has a blindspot how else do you explain that wreck outside
7675397 we also need to figure out where were going to get salt and how much it will cost
7675398 im going to ask the attorney general to look into this because i believe its a blatant attempt at price fixing
7675399 there are a lot of questions i have as a public official as to how the state handled this
7675400 the pipeline was empty in march of last year all year the mines have been running flat out
7675401 i cant tell you if theres going to be enough for everybody to have what theyve bid
7675402 the skyrocketing price of food has created a desperate situation for the worlds poor this grant will allow us to provide immediate relief to hungry families and help people feed themselves in the long run
7675403 mercy corps has been a very important partner of the foundation helping channel critical assistance to people in real times of need
7675404 this assistance transcends the immediate crisis and we rely on our partners such as mercy corps to help lay the groundwork for long term solutions that will not only increase small scale farmers productivity but will help them lead healthy productive lives
7675405 we put them up because of the storm that was headed to us fay
7675406 if youve got all your windows boarded up and theres a fire youre not going to be able to get out alive
7675407 well im going to take part of them down and then the other parts ill leave them off just in case
7675408 like a dead body or something the smell is really strong
7675409 the deputy will ask them to get out their id whatever theyre using
7675410 you dont check it you dont circle the name you dont underline it
7675411 storm water thats backed up can either contain sewage or runoff from septic systems if theyve been flooded
7675412 the water would become silty there was a lot more sediment in it and you would have to filter it
7675413 its a danger especially to kids who tend to play in it and put it in their mouth and hands in the water
7675414 there will be a lot of political activity down here there will be a lot of campaigning well get to see the candidates up close and personal well get a closer examination of the issues
7675415 its going to make the campaign here in florida and the election closer and theyre going to be able to identify with it much more
7675416 ramiele malubay is small in stature but big on renaldo lapuz sings us national anthem at pro baseball game in texas
7675417 i would not be sitting here with three gold medals or any gold medals around my neck if there hadnt been a facility in edinburgh
7675418 its very short sighted but hopefully there can be some pressure put on them from the successes in beijing
7675419 obviously theres a new track being built for the 2014 commonwealth games in glasgow
7675420 but to demolish a track in edinburgh means theres a whole crop of young riders who are never going to get the chance to try out the sport
7675421 you know even just for fun not necessarily to go on to become an elite performer but just to enjoy the sport of cycling
7675422 we need support not just at an elite level but also facilities to encourage youngsters to take up sport
7675423 not just for the olympics but for the general well being of the nation
7675424 in terms of scotland becoming an olympic nation by itself i think there needs to be a lot more investment in sport up there in terms of facilities again
7675425 scotland should always be a stand alone nation at whatever i believe
7675426 i have been very proud to represent scotland at the commonwealth games and thats something i will always cherish and i will hopefully compete again in future years
7675427 you spend most of your time gearing your day around that one hour on stage
7675428 trying to rest when you can trying not to party too hard or too often making sure that for that one hour you look like a superhero and then you walk off stage and you feel dead
7675429 oh yeah fuck my ass fuck it good i want to feel you shoot your load in my asshole
7675430 oh i feel it i can feel it im so full
7675431 you two had better get cleaned up and get becky back to the dorm
7675432 oh yeah fuck my ass fuck it good i want to feel you shoot your load in my asshole
7675433 oh i feel it i can feel it im so full
7675434 you two had better get cleaned up and get becky back to the dorm
7675435 we are looking for the particular gene or genes rather that may or may not cause diabetes or kidney disease
7675436 everyone is well aware it could be caused by environmental factors like the lack of exercise or poor diet however sometimes it isnt the obese person in a family who becomes diabetic
7675437 would probably be even more so if all those wishing to sell their home actually had the house on the market
7675438 i think men are really scared when they dont know me

7675444 you can spend a lot of money on landscaping send in a crew to slap down grass or you can take the permaculture view based on the ethical care of the earth
7675445 spend a lot of time in the hammock not mowing
7675446 you dont plant something only because its pretty and you want red flowers

7675456 we had been in the air for almost an hour when we heard a loud pop
7675457 the demand is over the top youve never seen anything like this
7675458 these were men who had been sentenced and found guilty by the supreme court walking around freely
7675459 theyre in the government karzai the americans the british sit down with them they have impunity theyve become very courageous and can do whatever crimes they like
7675460 they are two of new zealands most successful sportspeople and the community wants to congratulate their win in style mr yule said
7675461 we turned out in our droves four years ago and their feats at winning back to back gold medals will see thousands of people turning up to welcome them again she said
7675462 we told you the israelis are not partners for a two state arrangement
7675463 it was decided that it is not possible to recognize the plaintiff as a resident of israel

7675467 lets just say that it will open your eyes to some of the corruption in the psychic world
7675468 in business as in life there are lots of people who are up to no good
7675469 what is appalling is the way that some businesspeople treat psychic readings simply because they dont believe there are many people who treat this as they should as serious advice which should be considered among other opinions
7675470 heh looks like a decent game but i dont know if therell be another goal especially from roma
7675471 there are still chances to get the cash advance that they need but usually with a higher interest rate for that reason consumers need to research and compare different lenders before make a decision
7675472 then in order to compare they should write down the interest rate and additional fees
7675473 they started cursing at me and they ended up calming down for a minute and not saying anything so i thought that was the end of the situation
7675474 i knew there was about to be a confrontation of some sorts
7675475 my head hurts tremendously my eye hurts as well because they used their thumbs to try to gouge my eyes out
7675476 my left eye sustained some damage some loss of vision blurred vision
7675477 they didnt like someone asking them to tone it down so other patrons could enjoy the movie
7675478 you have air conditioning and a bathroom right there so you dont have to walk down the hallway pretty much better than a dorm room
7675479 conflicts with schedules and you may have to go to school 2 hours before your class starts
7675480 id rather live in a hotel than a dorm room
7675481 senator obama saying the question of when life begins is above his pay grade if he were to come to you and say help me out here madame speaker when does life begin what would you tell him
7675482 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7675483 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know
7675484 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions this isnt about abortion on demand its about a careful careful consideration of all factors and to that a woman has to make with her doctor and her god
7675485 the catholic church at the moment feels very strongly that it begins at the point of conception
7675486 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7675487 here is what the catechism of the catholic church says human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
7675488 it also says since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable looks like pelosi didnt study the subject long enough but not to worry we are sending her a copy of catholicism for dummies today
7675489 its the blind leading the blind in that party if the ardent practicing catholic doesnt care when life begins only that women have the choice to do what they choose sometimes thanks to people like pelosi not aware of what their choices actually are whether its life or not
7675490 my republican colleagues do not support contraception if you want to reduce the number of abortions and we all do we must it would behoove you to support family planning and and contraception you would think
7675491 barack obama is a pro abortion radical so theres nothing surprising about his choosing a pro abortion running mate
7675492 neither senator obama nor senator biden seems to have taken catholic arguments about the first principles of justice seriously
7675493 the churchs pro life position is not sectarian it can be engaged by anyone willing to work through a serious philosophical argument
7675494 neither obama nor biden seems willing to do that which casts a rather large shadow over their claims to be the ticket of thoughtfulness and intellectual seriousness
7675495 catholics for obama tying themselves into even tighter theological pretzels as they try to justify a vote for what seems likely to be the most radically pro abortion ticket in american history
7675496 an affable veteran politician who is unlikely to repeat the 2004 mistakes of sen john kerry by overselling his catholic credentials
7675497 a wake up call to the church clergy and laity alike
7675498 improve the way we hand on the faith be willing to exercise the spiritual work of mercy of admonishing the sinner and to keep politically active so that such people are voted out of office
7675499 if a politician cannot respect the life of a little baby how is he supposed to respect yours and mine
7675500 the democrats are slapping faithful catholics right in the face first they will nominate the most pro abortion candidate in history then they refuse to invite the beloved archbishop of denver even to offer a prayer at their convention and now they nominate a pro abortion catholic as vice president only self hating catholics could vote for this ticket
7675501 the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7675502 bidens own bishop bishop michael saltarelli of wilmington del has said that the issues pertaining to the sanctity of human life are the great civil rights issues of this generation
7675503 i would not appoint anyone who did not understand that section 5 of the 14th amendment and the liberty clause of the 14th amendment provided a right to privacy
7675504 thats the question id ask them if that is answered correctly that that is the case then it answers the question which means they would support roe v wade
7675505 i think its important for california to realize that we have two eastern senators on one ticket and then you have senator mccain who is often referred to as californias third senator
7675506 misleading and misinforming voters about ones title raises ethical questions and concerns about honesty integrity and character
7675507 i think its important for california to realize that we have two eastern senators on one ticket and then you have senator mccain who is often referred to as californias third senator
7675508 tell me who your friends are and ill tell you who you are

7675510 boy im nervous i hope i dont have a nightmare
7675511 we have a good credit rating and the most important thing you can do is use it to bond to raise money to put people to work when you have a weak economy
7675512 it might be building a wood chip plant in the northeast kingdom or investing in more cow power in the champlain valley it might mean that a community like montpelier might want to invest in a municipal heating authority or a community like bellows falls wants to look at geothermal for their town
7675513 often times they develop neck pain shoulder pain and back pain that leads them to the doctor
7675514 for elementary it shouldnt exceed 10 percent of their body weight then when you get into middle and high school the golden rule is about 15 percent of their body weight
7675515 theyve dedicated festivals to your film career which everyone knows pales in comparison to your music

7675517 a year ago i dont think anyone would have predicted minnesota could achieve a trifecta of fuel conservation increased use of mass transit and increased sales of cleaner burning alternative fuels in the middle of what has historically been the peak driving season

7675582 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
7675583 a full investigation is being conducted police and the information commissioner have been informed
7675584 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded onto a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
7675585 we are collaborating closely with the home office on this matter we have no further comment to make at this time
7675586 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
7675587 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
7675588 the home office has informed us that an internal investigation is being carried out into the data security arrangements between the home office and its contractor pa consulting we expect the home office to provide us at the information commissioners office with a copy of the report and its findings we will then decide what further action may be appropriate searching questions must be answered about what safeguards were in place to protect this information

7675604 for all the power of marketing consumers are all too often willing subjects of manipulation it is less the efficiency of advertising than the frailty of shoppers that renders resistance so problematic for in the absence of real wants and genuine needs consumers often seem to invite the producer of goods and services to tell them what it is that they want
7675605 people want to be told what they want they need to be shown what they need

7675647 a generation ago women were content to live in rural australia and marry the guy next door
7675648 what they wanted out of life was to get married and have kids the age of first confinement for women was 23 a generation on the age of first confinement is 31
7675649 women have gained eight years of freedom in their 20s and they arent hanging around rural australia they are travelling into cities for tertiary education and to develop and establish careers and when they migrate out of country towns it upsets the gender balance

7675715 next time and let me know in advance by advance i mean like before the first
7675716 and if i dont play ill be ready for kansas city
7675717 yeah i sure do ive been playing a lot of football so whether you play or dont play in the preseason id be ready no matter what its up to coach i was hoping i could play last week
7675718 es com n que personas que viajan a pa ses asi ticos traigan como souvenirs boas reci n nacidas
7675719 solo vieron cuando ya la pit n comenzaba a trag rselo por la cabeza y tuvieron que lidiar con ella para quit rselo
7675720 thats football its not complicated this is something that teams and kids and coaches do from 12 years old to college and beyond it isnt rocket science
7675721 i dont know if he realizes how much 17 million is that is absolutely ridiculous to turn that down hes already the highest paid defensive player in the league hes already making more than most quarterbacks michael is not thinking about the team hes thinking about himself
7675722 his personality hasnt been so that he can step up make a strong statement and have people believe that its coming from his heart
7675723 really the safest thing you can do is make all your food at home from scratch period
7675724 sometimes we buy the product anyway and sometimes we dont
7675725 what does this really mean can i count on it as a consumer to really have any meaning
7675726 advisory labeling may not be protecting the health of allergic consumers
7675727 not suitable for consumption by persons with an allergy to x
7675728 maybe illustrates how difficult it can be when you have food allergies to stay on top of that information
7675729 can i get to that box for a moment please
7675730 um no not to be rude or anything but no
7675731 excuse me has anybody handed in a small bag of cheese
7675732 oh hey that kind of sounds like number 11 from my new andy whitby cd
7675733 but that every person in this country can be whomever and
7675734 lets forget this mans sacrifice for his country and his proven leadership abilities and talk some more about change
7675735 a lost girl with a pretty face big heart and illusioned ambition
7675736 i usually edit everything down or put the end bit at the start
7675737 if youre starting to think about doing some production i think re editing is a great lesson in learning how to structure songs and tracks it definitely benefited my learning experience anyway
7675738 if youre going to do an edit press it and make money out of it you need to ask yourself does it need re editing
7675739 if you can play it out it doesnt simple if it has a cheesy sax breaks bad vocals or is really short then it does if youre editing just for your dj sets then anything is game
7675740 its hard to do a good edit if the original is bad i like all kinds of music so just edit whatever i like i dont care about genres
7675741 the first thing to consider is whether or not a track needs to be edited in the first place most great songs dont need to be messed with i tend to look for overlooked songs that have great parts but just dont work as a whole for reasons of length arrangement or crappy parts if you are going to do something more well known you better damned well do it properly and please leave michael jackson alone unless your name is terje
7675742 listen to the way that people like ron hardy danny krivit dj harvey and theo parrish do edits
7675743 some people will do the cut and paste thing but thats not really my way i usually try to stay close to the original and try to make it personal at the same time its a question of balance
7675744 just start with the basics of musical arrangement and djing
7675745 counting bars making sure the intro is long enough to mix with and ultimately whether or not the arrangement of your edit makes sense if you want your edit to be a dj tool to be used in the mix pay attention to the length and structure of the intro and outro and if youre going for more of a standalone song listen to the overall flow of your arrangement oh and dont think too much
7675746 listen to the song you are chopping up and pay attention to what youre doing with it
7675747 often accidents and random loops that you make while trying to do something else will suggest to you ideas that you otherwise wouldnt have thought of roll with it
7675748 the main thing to worry about when chopping a track into loops is the beginning and end of the loops and not whats in between

7675764 10 herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins
7675765 2 in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you
7675766 7 behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen
7675767 17 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god

7675831 like most australian financial services companies our results for the last financial year were directly and indirectly impacted by external events he said
7675832 however underlying business performance and momentum was maintained and we are well placed to ride out any further deterioration in the market as well as take advantage of any improvement in the industry cycle

7675966 i told the coastguard i had my finger in a hole and didnt want to spend the rest of my life there
7675967 they came out from exmouth and plugged the hole the only damage was my swollen finger
7675968 without his finger the boat would have sunk within an hour
7675969 we are after all democrats so it may take a while
7675970 were not the fall in line party we are diverse but make no mistake we are unified
7675971 i just want to make it absolutely clear we cannot afford four more years of president bushs failed policies
7675972 i am looking forward to being at the white house when president obama signs quality affordable health care for every american
7675973 i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7675974 we are united and we are together and we are determined
7675975 we have got our fingers crossed that things will improve
7675976 but there is a recognition that there is still quite a long way to go yet it looks as if it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7675977 if people realise that this is just a transitory period of subdued growth we will get through the other side and growth will resume to more normal levels
7675978 these two factors will help to ensure growth will start again
7675979 if we just cross our fingers maybe thats what we will get
7675980 the bank must be prepared to act as lender of last resort we cannot afford to let a major bank collapse he said
7675981 the current rule is like pouring petrol on a bonfire it helps the blaze go out more quickly but a lot of people get singed
7675982 we certainly believe that the impact of the credit crunch is going to take some time to sort out and it may be prolonged but if the right measures can be taken by the government and the monetary policy committee they can avoid a major recession
7675983 new school education that focuses around the montecito health triangle which incorporated physical mental and emotional well being in a person
7675984 almost 90 of what we know about the brain has been discovered in the last 35 years because that is when we have had the technology to study the brain so clearly our education system is over 200 years old the underling premise in our education system is guilt and punishment it is the philosophy of western education guilt and punishment sin and redemption therefore when a kid does something wrong they are classified as bad they are branded with that because of a mistake the mentality of you do something bad you must be punished does not help the kids we must teach them to learn from their mistakes there are some high schools that have police officers there are fences around some schools like prisons we dont want to teach our kids that we are free individuals who live in a democratic society of course we can put the whole society under police supervision but who will watch the police to make sure they dont cheat we want to teach kids how to be self responsible and free thinkers
7675985 the reason for having kids do the homework at school
7675986 is because all homes are not equal not every kid who goes home has a desk a computer and several hours to dedicate to homework some kids come from very bad families who do not have these resources also when kids do it right after the class ends the material is still fresh in their minds
7675987 the students may not like the idea of healthy food every day but im sure the parents will be glad
7675988 the small class sizes and the block schedule will give teachers a chance to have in depth discussions plan project and activities for students and answer questions
7675989 it was your wedding day and much drink had been consumed
7675990 you werent involved but got yourself involved and waded into two women who were attacking your wife
7675991 every girl dreams of their big day and this was mine and i ended up in jail instead of in my new husbands arms
7675992 in this case you were very significantly under the influence of alcohol you may not have realised it but you were one and a half times over the limit for driving
7675993 being part of a crew on an aircraft this is more stringently controlled
7675994 security staff suspected she may be under the influence of alcohol
7675995 police were called in officers smelled alcohol from the accused who was unsteady on her feet
7675996 she woke up the next day and felt fine but she was suffering from a migraine so took some herbal medication
7675997 she went with the rest of the crew to the airport by bus nothing was said by the captain about being under the influence
7675998 they went through security together and security officers were suspicious something was wrong with her
7675999 the accused has lost her job as a result of this she has been very upset
7676000 scotland should always be a stand alone nation at whatever i believe
7676001 for some people having a fry up might seem like a good way to start the day
7676002 but if you are doing this regularly then you are significantly increasing your risk of bowel cancer which is one of the most common cancers
7676003 only a third of people are aware of the link between processed meat and cancer which means two thirds are not in a position to make an informed choice about how much of it they eat
7676004 this is not a question of all or nothing because the more processed meat you eat the greater your risk for example if you eat 150g of it a day then you will be increasing your bowel cancer risk by about two thirds
7676005 but if you only eat 50g a day roughly the equivalent of a sausage then you will be increasing your risk by about a fifth
7676006 as well as the processed meat increasing the risk of bowel cancer fry ups also tend to be high in calories
7676007 we recommend people limit consumption of high calorie or energy dense foods because eating them regularly makes you more likely to gain weight this is important because there is convincing evidence that excess body fat increases risk of six different types of cancer
7676008 studies like this look at the dietary habits of large numbers of people so they tell us about the population as a whole
7676009 this makes it difficult to predict the risk to an individual but if anyone is looking to reduce their risk of bowel cancer moderating the red and processed meat they eat is a good way to start
7676010 its also important to remember that many other parts of your diet and wider lifestyle can affect the risk of bowel cancer along with the genes you inherit
7676011 uk lawyers have consistently been some of the highest earners in the city and across the uk
7676012 there will always be a demand for their services but it certainly looks as if the days of eye watering pay deals are over at least for the next year or two
7676013 the magic circle monopolise big deals because they are a brand
7676014 although they are in a highly competitive industry they enjoy being part of this as it is shorthand for trust
7676015 the credit crunch whilst not showing much impact this year has uk law firms worried
7676016 once they discovered that they werent getting out they decided to go sailing anyway and deal with it at low tide
7676017 the man had reversed into the water to launch his boat but was having trouble disconnecting the trailer from the land rover the beach is made up of sand and mud and they just could not shift it
7676018 they had to accept that the tide was going to wreck it it is quite a remote beach and the tide soon came half way up the cars doors so they had to give up then within 20 minutes it was totally submerged i guess a vehicle of that age is worth about 5 000 to 6 000
7676019 we waited until the tide went out and looked inside there were no fish but there was water everywhere
7676020 it was absolutely awful i heard a huge thud and went outside ive never seen so much blood it was pouring out of her mouth i tried to help her but she died in my arms
7676021 there were a large number of police cars the father and son were distraught the driver was inconsolable and was told to stay in his car
7676022 it was terrible there was lots of blood in the road and as soon as i came out i knew that the woman had died
7676023 lots of people were outside but all i could hear was an older man shouting you have killed my wife and a younger man shouting youve killed my mum
7676024 i looked out of the window and there was a woman lying in the middle of the road she had blood coming out of her mouth and wasnt moving
7676025 the husband was really upset he was on the ground crying she was on the ground and there was a big pool of blood
7676026 the thing that really got me was that the police wouldnt allow her two relatives to be near her if it was me i would have wanted my husband to be next to me
7676027 dear mum we were your sunflowers and through your love strength and support you made us grow we will love you forever
7676028 in memory of a kind caring beautiful and much loved lady who will never be forgotten
7676029 initial analysis of the police vehicles data recording system shows that the vehicle was travelling with its blue lights and sirens on
7676030 i cant wait to go home now and just relax im looking forward to my own bed and my mums roast dinner
7676031 she got a flight this morning to be here i had no idea thats was one of the best surprises i could have had almost as good as winning the gold the team did brilliantly im so proud of them and proud of myself im going to celebrate with a cup of tea and a biscuit when i get home
7676032 its quite overwhelming really its just the most incredible reception

7676060 the slowdown in housing starts has been very painful for the industry but it is the necessary medicine to work down the inventory of unsold homes
7676061 we need for sales to outpace production so we can work down these inventories thats what has to happen before we can get this thing back on track

7676068 are you hoping for a boy so youll have a pair
7676069 but there was so much development the price of the land was just too high or there were too many groups bidding on it
7676070 there were a lot of properties we would have loved to get control of
7676071 that was land they were looking to put houses on and if the real estate market was better they probably would have worked a lot harder to develop it
7676072 but if youre a tax supported group property taxes are not coming in like you budgeted for and that makes it difficult to buy
7676073 perception that park and forest preserve districts are the only ones out there with money
7676074 that was a property we were going to go after even in a hot housing market but were going to be paying that loan back for a couple of years so we have to be very careful
7676075 were like a business in that we cant spread ourselves too thin
7676076 id say the green movement by the aging baby boomer generation is an equal force
7676077 as they age and think about their legacy many are taking land that could be developed and making sure it becomes parks and forest preserves they want to leave something behind
7676078 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush

7676110 im just gonna have my opinion be honest and i dont foresee any problems im really excited about this and up for the challenge
7676111 its really flattering too you know to think that idol even thought about me
7676112 i mean when i got the call i thought they were calling the wrong person so im the new kid on the block and im hoping everyones gonna go easy on me and that i bring a lot to the table
7676113 im maybe not a household name but people know of me in the industry
7676114 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7676115 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7676116 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7676117 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7676118 id say i believe in what i believe in and im willing to fight for it and im pretty feisty
7676119 that when their song comes on the radio i know exactly who it is its not about vocal acrobatics
7676120 we knew it she wasnt vetted its just the facts we sorta knew it so im not upset i knew it and im excited about joe biden i think hes a great pick hillary is excited she is ready to campaign she went to nevada she went to florida she went to california she has raised millions of dollars for the obama campaign she is doing everything
7676121 despite fare increases air new zealand continues to only partially recover the increase in the total cost of fuel
7676122 it was a good week in holland and its the first time in a long while ive been in the mix and it felt good to go into the final day with the chance of a victory
7676123 it didnt work out but i feel as though i turned a very big corner last week just as i had done in my previous two events the british open and the us pga championship where i made the cut
7676124 my driving was very sound in holland and all i am continuing to work on is my putting and im confident that will fall into place sooner rather than later
7676125 i would estimate that the damage in the moorhouse ave lincoln rd area in the past few weeks would be in excess of 50 000

7676135 engineerings not sexy to talk about the annoying thing is that engineers are supposed to be calculating machines mathematically brilliant technocrats but theyre denied creativity brunel did it and he was a hero why cant engineering create it is hard when you are working with someone inventing but your work is absorbed into the authors credit
7676136 on absolutely the same terms we both got the contract and though there is a sort of tension in our work its that tension that makes a collaboration i challenge him and he challenges me
7676137 certainly we have heated arguments i dont think i could work like this with anyone except cecil we have a very similar way of thinking about certain things a similar approach to geometry similar notions of form
7676138 i shaped the fabric i wanted to explore form thats basically what i do
7676139 i thought im an ambitious chap but this is bloody ambitious
7676140 then i made a proposal to cecil for the whole project and we began playing around with various models
7676141 we throw around a range of ideas and they are mixed up with other realities like the money available the force of the wind can it be covered up the eventual use of the object in the end with him filtering and me filtering we come up with something that we both feel good about
7676142 so its not strictly me saying heres an idea lets make a bridge like this there is a process like any human situation in which there is an aesthetic world that we want to hold on to but that also has to relate to a physical logic if were going to do something we want it to be done in such a way that the means by which its achieved have a purity
7676143 its two rings a pole and a lot of tension
7676144 thats what its about how to do that with clarity
7676145 i have this plinth and you stretch these wires up from it and it will seem to vanish and then return as you walk round it and as the light changes itll be mysterious its a sort of threading in space and it is surely the biggest risk ive ever taken
7676146 for me the attraction was that he was thinking like i would like to think
7676147 this just furthers the economic development we can bring to kansas and adds to our motor sports portfolio by allowing other forms of racing
7676148 we can cater to a whole new demographic with car clubs
7676149 we are trying to provide the best opportunity for kansas
7676150 we are going to continue creating wealth for the state
7676151 if we arent awarded the contract we just cant make it work
7676152 i dont know how to throw it in the mix at this point
7676153 these and other issues will come up and we will be asking them about that
7676154 no one can disengage from the structure we live in
7676155 they dont dare to be themselves theyre all colourless sound the same
7676156 if death is pretty final im collecting vinyl im gonna dj at the end of the world
7676157 we have every expectation that the president will move forward on protecting these places sometime in the fall
7676158 today we put the champagne on ice and we will pop it open
7676159 these vast pacific areas are nearly three times the size of texas
7676160 countless seabirds dolphins fishes corals and tiny things as yet undiscovered could survive as a result free of the threats that are eliminating them elsewhere
7676161 if i was a giant id do whatever i could to get him out and have him back on my team
7676162 the guy still looks great hes a hell of a player i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7676163 he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind
7676164 he said he missed it but at the same time he said hes content and excited to go into the next phase of his life so i dont really look too strongly to that
7676165 fortunately we have players including kiwi who are capable of picking up that kind of slack
7676166 as always well continue to research all of our options
7676167 i decided to pull the old car out of the garage and see how i felt today get some of the dust off of it
7676168 the court found that the transporter instead deposited the materials on his own family farm
7676169 so he could get a change of clothes and money for fuel
7676170 that means that some 80 women per day have exercised their controversial right
7676171 i am happy that i can pursue both of my dreams to perform in adult movies and open my own restaurant at the same time
7676172 we will serve everything from a real boston steak and cheese to a chicken salad sandwich for those with a sweet tooth boston cream pie and cheesecake
7676173 the people honored have stood by me through highs and lows and i wanted to recognize them for the quality individuals they are both on and off camera
7676174 i think this year we have come out with a better pace in training camp we have come out with a better sense of urgency in practice knowing we dont have a warm up game or anything that gets us ready for the season opener we have to be ready for the first game
7676175 this game could kind of set the stage for our season no matter the outcome of the game we can learn a lot with it being a non conference game its not playing a good opponent four or five games into the season now we get to learn about ourselves in the first game
7676176 i feel good i feel confident i think preparation is going good so far we have a couple of extra days since this is the first game i think the guys are striding very well everythings getting put in and we feel very good
7676177 you know hes just a tremendous athlete a big play guy he works hard he doesnt come in with a big head like a lot of freshmen hes come in and earned his spot and showed the rest of the team on offense that he works for everything that he gets
7676178 he makes good catches every day but i think its just the way he comes to practice every day and doesnt expect everyone to give it to him that has impressed me the most as highly as he was ranked out of high school and all the publicity he has gotten he could have kind of very easily just thought he was going to walk into it but he has come in with a good attitude and good work ethic
7676179 the thing about being young is that you really dont know what else to expect so going into it there probably wont be too many nerves because everything happens so fast for those guys they have never been there never traveled on the road some guys have never flown on a plane before so it will be different for them but it will be happening so fast the game will be there and we have played so many football games growing up that it will just be like second nature and it will turn on for those guys
7676180 no im not concerned at all we have very good leaders who have brought everybody through camp getting ready for the season i feel very confident in these young guys
7676181 more pressure less pressure i dont know i am just going to take it like another season i have started two before so i kind of know what to expect and what its going to be like i am just going to use that experience to try and benefit me
7676182 i think our team is a lot closer a lot better so thats what excites me guys are able to care about each other and happy to be around each other that makes coming to practice everyday enjoyable no matter what
7676183 when you look on film they have a lot of great talent they have good players and good coaching they play hard that alone makes you raise your level of play and your preparation thats what a lot of the guys have been doing
7676184 their speed not only on offense but defense stands out they have a lot of speed they have two really good safeties up front they are fast and physical they get after it thats what weve been looking at im been watching film on those guys since about april every time i watch film i realize another guy stands out they do a good job and we are going to have to be on our a game
7676185 terrence cody is a beast hes gifted to be that big and be able to move that well hes very athletic i remember the first time i met him i actually saw him on the basketball court he was dunking hes a great athlete hes come in here and worked hard hes adjusted to everything the coaches have wanted him to do and im looking forward to watching him play on saturday
7676186 im just looking forward to going out and competing im not going to boast or brag im just going to go out there and have fun and do what im supposed to do im just going to go have fun

7676406 we cant keep the christians from going to church we cant keep them from reading their bibles and knowing the truth we cant even keep them from conservative values but we can do something else we can keep them from forming an intimate abiding relationship experience in christ if they gain that connection with jesus our power over them is broken so let them go to church let them have their conservative lifestyles but steal their time so they cant gain that experience in jesus christ this is what i want you to do distract them from gaining hold of their savior and maintaining that vital connection through their day
7676407 keep them busy in the non essentials of life and invent un numbered schemes to occupy their minds
7676408 tempt them to spend spend spend then borrow borrow borrow convince the wives to go work for long hours and the husbands to work 6 or 7 days a week 10 12 hours a day so they can afford their lifestyles keep them from spending time with their children as their family fragments soon their homes will offer no escape from the pressures of work
7676409 over stimulate their minds so that they cannot hear that still small voice entice them to play the radio or cassette player whenever they drive to keep the tv vcr cds and their pcs going constantly in their homes and see to it that evry store and restaurant in the world plays non biblical music constantly this will jam their minds and break that union with christ
7676410 let them be involved in soul winning but crowd their lives with so many good causes they have no time to seek power from christ soon they will be working in their own strength sacrificing their health and family unity for the good of the cause

7676423 i personally feel that early on in a relationship it is something we are working sooo very hard at the sweet notes the sweet talk the flowers the cards the putting someone always before ourselves
7676424 look ill be doing everything i can to make this dream come true for south australians
7676425 it would be helped if mr rann sa premier came along with us in a bipartisan way
7676426 we havent set an exact closing date but it would probably be around the april may or june time frame and they would have to have a proposal to us at that stage that would be their final proposal
7676427 it can still be made we will actually be putting proposals to the commonwealth games association from opposition
7676428 a bid from an opposition group would be very difficult because they couldnt guarantee theyd be in power at that time
7676429 i think youve got to have vision athletes have vision and goals if you dont have goals and this is a big one but i really see this as an investment
7676430 but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances
7676431 hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7676432 we are led by a very talented person in brendan nelson who has my full support who i believe is doing a great job and will lead us to the next federal election
7676433 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7676434 but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7676435 theres no leadership hassle going on in the party at all
7676436 brendan nelson is doing a fantastic job and i dont think its necessary at this stage we have a lot of talent in the liberal party federally
7676437 i am a big supporter of brendans and i want him to stay there
7676438 peter said after the last election that he was going to go and start another life i took him at his word
7676439 i think brendan nelsons leadership is fantastic brendan nelson is man who is continuing to take the fight up to the labor party

7676442 i know that people are dying in hospitals through avoidable causes because this has been partly reported
7676443 but the extent of this is really shocking and i think reba meagher has got some answering to do today
7676444 how do we address the issue is the key lesson that we have to take away from these individual cases
7676445 im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives this is going to be a more workman like speech
7676446 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and former president bill clinton understand the stakes
7676447 we are after all democrats so it may take a while were not the fall in line party we are diverse but make no mistake we are unified
7676448 the truth is im just bitter that clinton didnt get the nomination once again the black man has got something before any woman did sexism is alive and well in this country
7676449 there may be a few of us who go for mccain but most of us understand we need to kick republicans out of the white house
7676450 ive been in this business for 30 years and i have never seen anything of this magnitude before
7676451 there is more to this picture than fewer miles driven we have changed the way we drive and hopefully on a permanent basis
7676452 im really mindful of the speed limit signs now because i know that is a lot slower than the way i normally drive
7676453 there have been a lot of negative things said about the club in the past week and it was nice to get back to football
7676454 the response from my players was excellent right from the start they had the right attitude and tempo
7676455 irrespective of west ham having a man sent off i felt we would have won
7676456 i am desperately disappointed for our fans we started quite well but as the game wore on city got on top
7676457 we could not cope with it and when mark noble was sent off it became very very difficult for us
7676458 with 10 men everything has got to go for you and you have to defend properly and we didnt for their first goal

7676513 ed cavagnaro now one of your own flock a catholic woman from san francisco is now one of the most powerful people in all the country nancy pelosi a catholic from san francisco is the speaker of the house she is not only pro choice but she would be someone who would be working to try to keep abortion legal in your view is she less of a catholic because of that archbishop george niederauer well i have met on one occasion with speaker pelosi before she was speaker pelosi it was last year and i weve exchanged viewpoints on a number of things at that time it was last spring and it was principally about immigration because that was very much the hot button topic of the time we havent had an opportunity to talk about the life issues i would very much welcome that opportunity but i dont believe that i am in a position to say what i understand her stand to be if i havent had a chance to talk to her about it
7676514 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7676515 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7676516 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder

7676595 oh he is away from monday to friday and only comes home at weekends and sometimes he also has to work at weekends
7676596 he likes his job but says he doesnt like working away from his home he cannot change it as there are no other jobs he can get
7676597 he is like an angel when he is home and looks after me he worries about me but cannot get another job or become unemployed as we cannot live without his earnings

7676601 there are serious issues that have been accumulating including ethnic problems in tibet and xinjiang as well as social issues and conflicts that have been temporarily covered up by force to guarantee a successful olympics
7676602 i cannot predict whether there will be an immediate outbreak of all these problems after the olympics but there will be an outbreak if the government does not take steps to tackle the domestic problems
7676603 the pressure is building in the pressure cooker and theres no current avenue for it to be released i believe we will see many calls both inside and outside the party to put some sort of reforms on the agenda again
7676604 this has nothing to do with the legitimacy of the communist party or debates about political systems
7676605 i have had no red lights thrown up to me saying that construction is really in bad shape

7676608 i think what congress sees now with the rotations in and out of iraq and the stress we have on our fighting force the last thing we need is another one year unaccompanied place to send soldiers if we don t need to
7676609 i fundamentally believe that if you tell soldiers what their responsibilities are 99 9 percent will live up to that
7676610 i couldn t risk going all the way it s very hard to walk back if we really damage the alliance because of the actions of a couple of people
7676611 everyone really came together when it came to doing their mission

7676621 if inflation expectations continue to grow bringing down actual price inflation is going to be increasingly difficult
7676622 the knock on effect of this trend is that people will negotiate for higher pay rises and retailers will try harder to hike prices because the climate is more lenient towards inflation this will only hinder efforts to bring inflation under control
7676623 this will be of urgent concern for the bank of england which has stated inflation will fall back below its 2 per cent target within two years

7676653 when we left the camp they all gave us pieces of paper with a telephone number on them saying when you get back to france phone my friend phone my father phone my brother say we are here that their uncle is dead and that we are here and they have to help us that is how it began during the war in bosnia it was the same in the 45 times i went there every time we have come back from mostar or sarajevo and so on we had a list of people to call when we got home
7676654 every time we saw the same thing there is a need for victims to be able to communicate and all the non governmental organisations ngos also need telecommunications
7676655 part of the problem is that i have a big mouth
7676656 now i am more not relaxed but careful about what i say
7676657 we opened our little centre in a village school and a load of people came what was fantastic was that a few days later i remember seeing people arriving in cars to take away their family and we thought this idea is good
7676658 it was our first intervention for a natural disaster we stayed there for 10 days
7676659 the most dangerous thing we do is use the local equipment like cars and helicopters we go to poor countries and the cars are old and we drive very fast because we have to arrive very quickly the helicopters we have to use are sometimes helicopters that should not be made to fly but in an emergency you have no choice

7676675 we have now got about nine large plantations across the south of england
7676676 it takes a long time for a plantation to start producing once it has been infected with the fungi you usually have to wait for between eight and 10 years
7676677 the man and his van is always a bit of a fear
7676678 i guess once we start producing people will know who we are but id like to keep a low profile until then

7676680 this illustrates the ongoing crisis the fact that there is so little meeting of minds between the dup and sinn fein it isnt a brilliant example of partnership government
7676681 the power sharing government in northern ireland was established after the st andrews talks which envisaged transfer of policing powers by may but unionists ruled this out as being too early
7676682 this sinn fein statement suggests a lot of work to be done around the whole issue what is clear is theres a degree of unhappiness
7676683 i find the debates in the house of lords to be of a higher quality than those in the common

7676701 en parte la causa de este fen meno es que los lugares en la televisi n abierta se han reducido y la lucha feroz por el rating achica a n m s el espacio que hab a antes para una gran variedad de programas pero tambi n est el hecho de que la tv por cable hoy es una opci n elegida por cada vez m s personas y entonces ese medio se presenta como una opci n v lida en el que muchas propuestas encuentran su lugar adecuado para recalar
7676702 el pasaje se debe al cambio que sufri en los ltimos a os nuestra televisi n abierta que ofrece un conjunto de programas muy similares entre s muy ligeros sin posibilidades de espacios para la reflexi n o el an lisis
7676703 hace unos 20 a os alejandro romay que de este medio sabe un poco me dec a que hab a que acostumbrarse a hablar de televisi n a secas sin diferenciar entre aire y cable porque en el futuro la gente no iba a separar una cosa de la otra y eso es lo que pasa cada vez m s hoy en d a en el caso de mi programa a los canales de aire simplemente no les interesa tener una propuesta de servicio como la que ofrecemos nosotros porque comercialmente el programa cerraba sin problemas y ten a un rating aceptable para los domingos a la tarde sin embargo en el pasaje no hubo pr cticamente diferencias nosotros trabajamos igual que cuando est bamos en el aire los sponsors nos apoyan igual y la gente nos lleva los s bados las mascotas que encuentra a colonia 156 desde donde salimos en vivo
7676704 en los 24 a os que vengo haciendo este programa pude comprobar que la proporci n de 40 horas de trabajo semanales para hacer una hora de programa por semana es inevitable ese es el tiempo que siempre hubo que invertir para hacer el ciclo cuando est bamos en el aire y es el mismo tiempo que nos lleva ahora una diferencia es el presupuesto con el que se cuenta que sale de la venta de publicidad en el cable es menor lo que se recauda fundamentalmente porque el valor del minuto de publicidad es inferior al que hay en la televisi n de aire pero ese par metro se ajusta saliendo a vender publicidad m s agresivamente

7676715 based on the foregoing analysis i conclude that city councils resolution of june 16 2008 does not amend the referendum resolution of nov 2 2006
7676716 the application for an order compelling the city of moose jaw to hold a referendum seeking authorization from the electors to increase the citys financial commitment for the construction of a multiplex facility financed by means of a tax increase as contemplated in the june 16 2008 resolution is dismissed

7676724 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
7676725 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway

7676728 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
7676729 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
7676730 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
7676731 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
7676732 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
7676733 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

7676735 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
7676736 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
7676737 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing

7676744 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
7676745 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother

7676801 then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance agronomic productivity disease resistance insect resistance and value added grain characteristics
7676802 at 75 percent evapotranspiration you have 3 to 4 inches of available moisture that is used where if you are watering at 100 percent it is wasted
7676803 one of our experimental hybrids produced the same amount of silage in both locations when irrigation was reduced from 100 percent to 75 percent
7676804 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7676805 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7676806 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7676807 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7676808 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7676809 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7676810 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7676811 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7676812 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7676813 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7676814 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7676815 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7676816 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
7676817 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
7676818 i recognize that some who do dna barcoding may be upset by this study but that is the nature of science
7676819 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal but we need to be careful to pay attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
7676820 there are theories about hormonal differences but none has been proved
7676821 its been documented in several studies that men are at increased risk of recurrence
7676822 this needs to be validated in a second study which we are currently planning
7676823 the study will take about two years to recruit patients and will have a one year follow up so results are expected in three years
7676824 one would be happy to be able to recommend stopping
7676825 the current recommendation is to remain on long term therapy but many patients elect not to do it
7676826 oftentimes patients choose not to take an anticoagulant blood thinner
7676827 so a physician might feel more comfortable to allow women with one or fewer of these risk factors to discontinue the medication
7676828 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7676829 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7676830 we all saw queenslanders claim the majority of australias olympic medals and of all the states in australia i believe we should have the healthiest people
7676831 our natural environment is the best in the country but while our elite athletes are the envy of the world the figures show the rest of us are falling behind
7676832 i think we have a high rate of fit people on the coast and certainly during election time people wanted funding for bikeways walking paths and boardwalks because people here spend a lot of time at the beach and a lot of people do sports
7676833 there is a significant amount of money we could use for that because the bike and walkways particularly in the central and southern regions are in need of some work
7676834 they would be the major things because thats what were focussing on as a region and they have the dual benefit for fitness and health and also as an alternative mode of transport which is critical for us
7676835 if thats what has triggered this then its good that the state government is doing something about it
7676836 you only have to look around and you see people walking and running and i think more than other areas people on the coast get active
7676837 i think my opponent has an obligation to talk about the district every two years for his re job interview or if i could put it a different way he has an obligation to explain to himself to the voters every two years
7676838 i think its important for california to realize that we have two eastern senators on one ticket and then you have senator mccain who is often referred to as californias third senator

7676849 this was a surprising and exciting finding our direct observations appear to totally undermine a key rule that has withstood the test of time for over a century we will now make observations with a range of other chemicals and with other techniques to further elucidate the molecular basis for our observations text books will have to be rewritten to revise a rule that has been relied on for over a century advanced techniques such as the one we have developed should give much clearer insight into the action of a wide range of drug molecules which will be of significant interest to drug developers
7676850 its important to test any scientific tool because all have limits some situations are more suited than others for barcode use
7676851 this research could help clarify the answer to that question
7676852 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
7676853 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
7676854 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal
7676855 but we need to pay careful attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
7676856 scientists have been so preoccupied with creating a barcode of life that they have not been careful in monitoring the accuracy of the underlying data

7676871 he likes his job but says he doesnt like working away from his home he cannot change it as there are no other jobs he can get
7676872 he is like an angel when he is home and looks after me he worries about me but cannot get another job or become unemployed as we cannot live without his earnings

7676883 you can play through the entire game without killing anything
7676884 its very challenging but its also very beneficial when the game initializes the relationships of other creatures or tribes or civilizations for the next level many of those relationships have to do with how aggressive those creatures perceive you to be
7676885 we werent thinking of the sims as a brand we were thinking of it as an offbeat computer game with spore we had the confidence that the players would always exceed our expectations if we gave them more creative control from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand
7676886 you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined
7676887 spore on almost any platform is going to be different and tied to the unique aspects of that platform

7676935 but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances
7676936 hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7676937 we are led by a very talented person in brendan nelson who has my full support who i believe is doing a great job and will lead us to the next federal election
7676938 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7676939 but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7676940 chevron and the other partners believe there will synergies that can be achieved by exxon operating the project
7676941 they already have a significant staffing component in atlantic canada and experience in operating in atlantic canada by virtue of their operation of the hibernia offshore oil project
7676942 all the partners are in agreement that we need to move as expeditiously as possible
7676943 weve been encouraging it for close to two years now as a voluntary program
7676944 theres a positive interest from the students in doing it
7676945 they didnt make students aware of it caught them off guard in the middle of the year the students were used to using a tray for everything
7676946 we tend to eat with our eyes and take we what we think we want
7676947 to see dining propose a program as ambitious as this one and i think current students will be surprised by how much is saved with such a simple change
7676948 first years may find the change pretty easy because they wont know any other way
7676949 like most australian financial services companies our results for the last financial year were directly and indirectly impacted by external events he said
7676950 however underlying business performance and momentum was maintained and we are well placed to ride out any further deterioration in the market as well as take advantage of any improvement in the industry cycle
7676951 thats still a good performance in a deteriorating economic environment mr mulcahy said
7676952 were very comfortable at the moment with the underlying securities chief financial officer chris skilton said
7676953 its not to say were not watching them very closely though
7676954 certainly the majors have indicated that they would move their rates down he said
7676955 were not a price setter we usually follow so well follow appropriately
7676956 they obviously had a go at iag and they seem to have moved on from than he said
7676957 they recently bought pmi a mortgage insurer so i dont know what their strategy is with regards to acquisitions now
7676958 we wouldnt comment on market rumour but were quite confident that our business is performing strongly
7676959 based on the outlook and continuing good progress on integration the board anticipates the groups ordinary dividend for the full year to june 2009 will be maintained at 107 cents per share suncorp said
7676960 while i understand shareholders will be disappointed by the headline result management responded well to the external challenges we faced our business remains fundamentally sound and the outlook for the current financial year is positive he said in a statement
7676961 merging our banking operations makes sense in the current economic environment and market cycle mr mulcahy said
7676962 this change has been on the radar for some time and the timing is now right
7676963 the recent gse sell off has been surprising since the only catalyst was apparently a press report suggesting that federal officials are likely to recapitalize the gses soon
7676964 we continue to be in touch with the companies and their regulators and continue to stay on top of this
7676965 m s instrumentos y cargado de optimismo como los anteriores
7676966 there was discussion about the fact that the market has become increasingly competitive and that for us to be able to continue to maintain our level of competitiveness in australia we need to work with the government on future transitional assistance programs the spokesman said
7676967 mr mulally reiterated the significant investment that ford has made in australia over the past 82 plus years including recent significant investments such as the development of the all new falcon and the fact that australia is the global engineering lead of the corporations next global light pick up truck he said
7676968 that re emphasised our commitment to australia and that it is an ongoing commitment
7676969 our choice of projects in 2008 was dictated less by a desire for flashiness rather we were determined to choose those projects most likely to add solid worth to koffice
7676970 this brings to the state of utah a major astronomical initiative to survey distant galaxies survey the early universe to uncover the origin of the first galaxies understand the birth and evolution of our galaxy and discover planets in other solar systems that would have a suitable environment for harboring life
7676971 boosts the reputation of the department and the university and brings internationally important astronomers to utah to collaborate with u scientists and to design future instruments together
7676972 all faculty undergraduate students and graduate students at the university of utah will have access to the data from this survey to pursue research at the forefront of astronomy
7676973 elevating the university of utah to one of the premier physics and astronomy departments
7676974 would love to see more women get into the sciences into physics and astronomy
7676975 joining a recognized astronomy project like sdss iii is a stepping stone to a successful astronomy program at the university of utah
7676976 the wide scope of the sdss iii program from planet searches to galactic studies to cosmology offers ample choices of research topics to faculty and students
7676977 they are going to take light that comes from a star or galaxy pass it into a high resolution spectrograph and look at the specific color lines emitted by specific molecules in the star or galaxy
7676978 use those measured colors to determine the distance to the star or galaxy and the processes occurring within those objects
7676979 mapping the stars of our galactic halo the roughly spherical region with few stars surrounding the populous galactic disk
7676980 measures the abundance of the chemical elements in hundreds of thousands of stars in the milky way
7676981 these precise measurements will reveal how and when the various chemical elements formed in previous generations of stars
7676982 besides the scientific implications this kind of search has repercussions in the way humanity perceives its place in the cosmos
7676983 they are an obvious attempt to smear the senators character
7676984 shame on all of us for not helping with the project
7676985 after all he has done for us every man woman and child should have chipped in to build our greatest alaskan ever a home the size of the white house
7676986 most importantly however disclosure of the things of value and the negative repercussions flowing from that disclosure would have threatened the defendants future stream of things of value from veco bill allen and others
7676987 we are determined to continue in kent the spirit and commitment of section 28
7676988 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet mr bean said
7676989 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet

7677002 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
7677003 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
7677004 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest
7677005 there was one of those six projects that was removed altogether why because the senator and the representatives from that district were from the wrong political party we need to take a step back
7677006 im prepared to bid for that first ticket to shoot a wolf myself
7677007 to get a kick out of smoking industrial hemp it would take a cigar the size of a telephone pole

7677010 theres a lot of things that i pointed out in my state of the state address that havent passed unfortunately i cant think of one that has
7677011 paralympic athletes and disabled spectators are a special group they have unique personalities and ways of thinking
7677012 some physically disabled are isolated unsocial and introspective they can be stubborn and controlling defensive and have a strong sense of inferiority
7677013 physically disabled people are often mentally healthy they show no differences in sensation reaction memorization and thinking mechanism from other people but they might have unusual personalities because of disfigurement and disability
7677014 when you make eye contact do not fuss or show unusual curiosity never stare at their disfigurement
7677015 a patronizing or condescending attitude will be easily sensed even for a brain damaged patient
7677016 youre probably asking yourself how can a trail running shoe help me avoid compressing my spinal cord into a slinky on the side of some unsuspecting conifer thereby rendering me a drooling misshapen non extreme trail running husk of my former self forced to roam
7677017 do not monopolise your knowledge nor impose arrogantly your techniques but respect and combine your skills with the knowledge of the researched or grassroots communities taking them as full partners and co researchers do not trust elitist versions of history and science which respond to dominant interests but be receptive to counter narratives and try to recapture them do not depend solely on your culture to interpret facts but recover local values traits beliefs and arts for action by and with the research organisations do not impose your own ponderous scientific style for communicating results but diffuse and share what you have learned together with the people in a manner that is wholly understandable and even literary and pleasant for science should not be necessarily a mystery nor a monopoly of experts and intellectuals

7677029 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
7677030 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
7677031 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest
7677032 there was one of those six projects that was removed altogether why because the senator and the representatives from that district were from the wrong political party we need to take a step back

7677045 the current situation is clearly unacceptable not only is bail granted too easily even for some serious offences but the system to ensure that those on bail comply with the courts rulings is little more than a paper tiger as a result people are put at risk and their confidence in the judicial process is being undermined criminals who should be facing justice often do as they please with complete contempt for the law and virtually without penalty i believe the bail laws should be tightened and the supervision of those on bail should be put back in the hands of the probation service bail hostels should be subject to proper planning procedures so that the concerns of local residents can be taken into account
7677046 it was clear from our extensive research that the increasing internationalization of the wood supply chain the changing ownership structure of american forests and the increasing diversity of wood certification programs globally demanded a more holistic transparent approach

7677052 now is the ideal time of year to check on the energy efficiency of your home proper insulation can make a real difference to your bills as much as 1 in every 3 spent on heating bills is wasted in poorly insulated homes
7677053 id also encourage people to make the market work for them to contact their energy suppliers to see whether they qualify for a reduced tariff and find out what they provide to improve energy efficiency
7677054 customers should shop around and consider switching their energy supplier as different firms offer different tariffs average savings from switching are between 130 150 in total

7677078 i really only know one person in new mexico who has said he will not vote for obama
7677079 disappointed that obama didnt pick hillary as his running mate
7677080 i have been a friend of hillarys for a very long time i joined her fan club four years ago i will vote for hillary here this week and then i will support obama i dont want to but i will i dont think he has been very respectful to hillary
7677081 but the prime minister has many other commitments so that may not be possible
7677082 the area is very exposed to the falling of seracs towers of ice
7677083 there is no reason to put the lives of rescuers at risk for the sake of recovering the bodies this is no longer an emergency situation
7677084 the expedition had been planned down to the smallest detail there was no negligence the avalanche descended on us and there was nothing we could do to avoid it
7677085 it was a terrible experience until that point the climb had gone beautifully the mountain was enchanting until the arrival of that executioner announced by a sort of creaking like the breaking of a beam then total darkness for several minutes i thought i had been buried in the snow but when it was all over i found i could still breathe im alive i told myself
7677086 every summer 30 000 people climb the mont blanc range
7677087 the refuges are at bursting point the one at gouter you literally cant get into
7677088 before taking their clients up mont blanc guides should find out whether there is room in the refuges
7677089 instead of making their clients sleep on the ice and under canvas at 4 000m they should postpone the expedition
7677090 icefall avalanches can happen any day in the summer and summer climbers need to be more tuned in to them they tend to be on the look out for other hazards like rock falls
7677091 which is not much different to being hit by a rock
7677092 the best way to avoid them is to choose a route that is not exposed to too many seracs in fact the traditional route up mont blanc du tacul was abandoned one reason being that it was far more exposed to icefalls than the one the climbers used on sunday
7677093 i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
7677094 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7677095 the carnival is the perfect london spectacle to captivate the world with its dazzling array of costumes and music
7677096 this years event was enjoyed by more than a million people as the sights and sounds of the caribbean and other cultures came alive on the streets

7677098 but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances
7677099 hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7677100 we are led by a very talented person in brendan nelson who has my full support who i believe is doing a great job and will lead us to the next federal election
7677101 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7677102 but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7677103 theres no leadership hassle going on in the party at all
7677104 brendan nelson is doing a fantastic job and i dont think its necessary at this stage we have a lot of talent in the liberal party federally
7677105 i am a big supporter of brendans and i want him to stay there
7677106 peter said after the last election that he was going to go and start another life i took him at his word
7677107 i think brendan nelsons leadership is fantastic brendan nelson is man who is continuing to take the fight up to the labor party

7677129 its not overly complicated guys look open but they are not for very long you feel you can run reverses all of a sudden a defender peels off and instead of a huge gain you get two or three yards and are left wondering why you spent time on that play

7677148 i was probably the most visible hillary supporter there was
7677149 she didnt win i can accept that and i think most people are accepting that
7677150 bottom line we as a party cant afford another bush kind of term
7677151 i liked hillary i saw what she went through with the republicans and she didnt cave in
7677152 but i am not about to vote republican because she isnt the nominee

7677241 i hope the bank of england are doing more than cross their collective fingers

7677243 some vulnerable citizens are going to need help for example when it comes to paying their fuel bills this winter
7677244 the worst way to approach this would be though an arbitrary and unfair tax raid that would jeopardise badly needed investment in our energy infrastructure in the years ahead

7677271 republicans in congress are demanding that president bush investigate whether oil companies are now gouging consumers on these gas prices thats a good idea republicans asking republicans to investigate other republicans and you know who theyre going to blame the democrats
7677272 these days its good to know we still have friends in the middle east friends like saudi arabia thats right where may i remind you four of the 19 september 11th hijackers were not from
7677273 im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives this is going to be a more workman like speech
7677274 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and former president bill clinton understand the stakes
7677275 we are after all democrats so it may take a while were not the fall in line party we are diverse but make no mistake we are unified
7677276 the truth is im just bitter that clinton didnt get the nomination once again the black man has got something before any woman did sexism is alive and well in this country
7677277 there may be a few of us who go for mccain but most of us understand we need to kick republicans out of the white house

7677287 as a nation were very proud of her and she is a shining example to all young people of what can be achieved with hard work and commitment
7677288 what better way to honour her than to name her local pub after her
7677289 we hear shes a fan of burger and chips so rebecca whenever you come into adlington arms your meal is on the house
7677290 i think its a good idea shes the pride of mansfield
7677291 im doing this because my husbands running for president of the united states
7677292 family is first for us and it will always be that way
7677293 hes a wonderful man hes a gifted man but in the end hes just a man
7677294 i want to publicly proclaim my love and adoration for my wife michelle obama
7677295 i knew then and there there was something special about this guy
7677296 for the first time in my adult lifetime im really proud of my country
7677297 this is a man who used to swim and box and run served in the military one day woke up and couldnt walk
7677298 i never knew him to be a man who could walk without the aid of crutches
7677299 my challenges are much more public but theyre the same as most women and we need to figure this out
7677300 how do we define roles for ourselves as women that are healthy and balanced and make sense
7677301 we decided that we wanted to take a little more of a proactive approach in determining not only how we could design things differently but how we could walk the walk so we could have some real experience in how we could reduce our energy use
7677302 im just gonna speak to simon the way i speak to everybody
7677303 im just gonna have my opinion be honest and i dont foresee any problems im really excited about this and up for the challenge
7677304 its really flattering too you know to think that idol even thought about me
7677305 i mean when i got the call i thought they were calling the wrong person so im the new kid on the block and im hoping everyones gonna go easy on me and that i bring a lot to the table
7677306 im maybe not a household name but people know of me in the industry
7677307 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7677308 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7677309 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7677310 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7677311 id say i believe in what i believe in and im willing to fight for it and im pretty feisty
7677312 that when their song comes on the radio i know exactly who it is its not about vocal acrobatics
7677313 its not just about the speaker but mugabe has lost control of parliament which makes it very difficult to govern
7677314 the majority of people in zimbabwe are saying if you are not in control of the security forces dont sign because it means mugabe can unleash violence whenever he likes
7677315 guess where i cased this card from in the su catty
7677316 i think the most unrepresented minority in this country is young people
7677317 as the republican party kind of shifts away from libertarian principles i think its opening up a great opportunity for democrats in the west
7677318 i dont think states are red states or blue states
7677319 we asked our listeners what they wanted from 94 wysp they made it clear to us and that is exactly what we are delivering
7677320 we are so happy to welcome the sound to the presslaff family to work with sammy simpson dave beasing haley jones and peter burton on developing listener relationships databases ratings and revenue personally im equally happy to listen to the sound as i drive around la
7677321 presslaff understand how important developing listener relationships will be to the sound its great to have the company on board with us
7677322 robert is a true professional and a top notch programmer
7677323 there is no doubt we are seeking peace and we are calling for the achievement of our national principles
7677324 there will be no peace without the release of all prisoners
7677325 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7677326 while there is not a stable government in islamabad then the law and order situation in nwfp and the federally administered tribal areas fata will not be solved
7677327 saving lives should be the first issue then we can look at the judges
7677328 are we now a laughing stock for those who didnt want democracy in pakistan for them its a victory but were both losers
7677329 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7677330 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7677331 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7677332 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
7677333 building the b reactor was a feat of engineering genius so too was the construction a testament to the excellence of working americans
7677334 theres an enormous amount of things that can be learned here whether its about enrico fermi the history of nuclear energy or how a nuclear plant works
7677335 we want people to be able to stop in and spend some time here
7677336 this does not mean that the sentencing guidelines for white collar crimes should be a black stain on common sense
7677337 all praises due to god the lord of the universe god who created us and created for us to live and enjoy and be righteous as well as strong
7677338 we are extremely interested in finding out who did this
7677339 youre going to have to bring something from your boss office

7677352 flight centre starts the new financial year with significant momentum from 2007 08 a strong balance sheet and with foundations in place for further growth
7677353 while we do not expect to replicate the 30 per cent to 40 per cent increases we have achieved in each of the past two years we will be disappointed if we do not increase pre tax profit by 10 to 15 per cent
7677354 flight centre continues to increase its scale in all countries while also developing a broader foundation
7677355 in addition to being one of the worlds leading leisure travel providers the company is now a significant and emerging presence in global corporate and wholesale travel
7677356 we see our diversity of both brands and geography as a platform for the future and a real strength
7677357 but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances
7677358 hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7677359 we are led by a very talented person in brendan nelson who has my full support who i believe is doing a great job and will lead us to the next federal election
7677360 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7677361 but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7677362 theres no leadership hassle going on in the party at all
7677363 brendan nelson is doing a fantastic job and i dont think its necessary at this stage we have a lot of talent in the liberal party federally
7677364 i am a big supporter of brendans and i want him to stay there
7677365 peter said after the last election that he was going to go and start another life i took him at his word
7677366 i think brendan nelsons leadership is fantastic brendan nelson is man who is continuing to take the fight up to the labor party
7677367 what is very clear is that there isnt any economic leadership
7677368 i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
7677369 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7677370 the carnival is the perfect london spectacle to captivate the world with its dazzling array of costumes and music
7677371 this years event was enjoyed by more than a million people as the sights and sounds of the caribbean and other cultures came alive on the streets
7677372 i love the music and the dancing and im definitely going to come again next year

7677383 team obama is moving toward the supply side and pivoting toward the political center on key aspects of its tax policy writing in thursdays wall street journal obama advisors jason furman and austan goolsbee outlined a plan that would only raise tax rates on capital gains and dividends from 15 percent to 20 percent for individuals making more than 200 000 and on family incomes above 250 000 prior to this investors worried that obama would double the 15 percent tax rate on cap gains and bring the 15 percent rate on dividends back to 40 percent
7677384 obamas 20 percent rate on investment investors would suffer a 6 percent incentive loss on their cap gain incomes and another 5 5 percent incentive drop on dividends the cost of capital would rise under obama and investment returns would decline by more than 11 percent uncle sam will keep more and investors will retain less all while the economy is languishing
7677385 the obama people acknowledge at least some effects from supply side incentives and perhaps they are implicitly recognizing the likelihood that higher tax rates on cap gains and dividends will generate lower revenues and a higher budget deficit
7677386 it also seems clear that the obama tax plan is not a growth policy but a social policy that uses tax fairness as a means of redistributing income theres a long history of failed redistributionism and this is where the obama plan falls apart
7677387 plus the worlds changed since the 1990s the flat tax revolution coming out of eastern europe has slashed marginal rates on individuals and corporations resulting in strong growth and big revenue gains that keep budget deficits down
7677388 team obamas small shift toward the supply side remains a positive development
7677389 the 64 000 question is are you going to eat deli meats
7677390 damage control and financial minimization at a time like this has not even been considered
7677391 the short term financial impact of this action is secondary to our responsibility to safeguard our consumers health
7677392 for a number of reasons we believe the situation is different
7677393 first of all food borne illnesses are an everyday risk that producers must watch for and as such customers may be more understanding secondly maple leaf can supply its customers from other facilities so customers do not need to turn to a competitor
7677394 will consumers react the same way its too early to tell
7677395 this may serve the company well in the eyes of customers
7677396 huge disaster that you might as well write of the brand at that point
7677397 consumers will be wondering when they are buying private label product whether it is maple leaf product even if they are buying stuff at restaurants
7677398 i think it is important that canadians understand what is on our agenda and what is not on our agenda
7677399 what is on our agenda is being tough on crime and punishing criminals and what is not on our agenda is re opening a debate on abortion that clarity i think is helpful for canadians especially as we go into a period where they might be forced to make a choice
7677400 weve heard criticism from across the country including representatives from the medical community that mr epps bill as it is presently drafted could be interpreted as instilling fetal rights
7677401 i think it is a cynical pre election ploy to hide the fact that mr harper has never publicly stated where he publicly stands on a womans constitutional right to control her own body
7677402 we believe that post games and for a long period of time these venues will be used pretty well
7677403 the management companies will immediately open them up for public use
7677404 we cant expect in the short term all the investment will be regained right away
7677405 if we rely only on swimming pool tickets we certainly will lose money
7677406 so we will have other products to guarantee the operation in the long run
7677407 will become a premiere destination for fans after the olympic games

7677419 i didnt know much about american football but i wanted to know more my dad got me a rule book on football on kicking through the uprights i was fascinated by it
7677420 i just thank god for this opportunity there have been rough times and good times and im thankful for all of them
7677421 it was aaron and now ben and i can never think the jobs mine i talked to mike nugent a while back and he said he could never afford to take a day off he could never relax never be content i feel the same way
7677422 but this was the dream its great to know going into the season that its my job i have a lot of confidence right now
7677423 gary anderson told me you could come here and play pro football and just kick field goals and if youre good you never have to worry about money
7677424 and not just because i was a first round pick as a competitor it drives you nuts when someone says you cant compete id practice but every week i couldnt go out and find out what the nfl was all about
7677425 coach saw something i didnt and he knows what hes doing
7677426 i know its the preseason but it was like a dream come true
7677427 i want to be the guy at the top but i have to keep working hard to have a chance
7677428 last year was hard to describe hard to put into words except it drove me nuts
7677429 this year will be different i think it will be a blessed year
7677430 everyone in the faraway regions of china was watching the olympics on television every day it left a grand impression on us it makes chinese people more confident in the world and more influential
7677431 i hope the world doesnt think that china is a rich developed nation
7677432 we still have many poor regions outside the big cities chinas next goal should be to improve the life of its ordinary people
7677433 we want to hear more public opinion on whether or how to keep the rule
7677434 i own a car but i understand and support this policy of bringing back the blue skies
7677435 im afraid they will stop giving us foreign aid because they think we are not poor any more its wrong i grew up in the countryside and i know how hard the rural life is some farmers are still very poor
7677436 but were making progress some major social problems are disclosed in the media and then they get solved im confident that china will become more and more open in every field
7677437 i hope some of the new traffic restrictions can be continued as long term policies
7677438 everyone can see how great the weather is these days i have a car of my own but im willing to bicycle to my office every second day it makes me healthier it improves the air and it saves money on gasoline too
7677439 this is a guy who has passed himself off as a texan he thought it would be good for his career to buy a ranch and cut some brush that has not been good for texas
7677440 we didnt make it all the way because barack obama chose the best candidate of all
7677441 has got an opportunity to really put texas in play if they will take advantage of it
7677442 at the very least theyve got to have joe biden
7677443 beginning today the nation and the world will focus its attention on the presidential nominating conventions and cq will be there in full force to cover the action
7677444 we are extremely proud of our unparalleled coverage thanks to our award winning journalists and the variety of vehicles we are using to deliver that coverage
7677445 this is who i am im addicted to the stuff it consumes my mind he said of pornography in his first interview on
7677446 im sick and this is why i had to come up some sort of explanation of what was happening in my body
7677447 i dont know how you can fake vomiting all over yourself night after night after night im not that good an actor he said
7677448 ive been living a lie for a long time he said
7677449 i can honestly say to you that the last two years have been hell for me physically emotionally but i never sat down and said lets try and fool the world
7677450 i dont have any desire to attain any financial gain from that were already making stages to sign those royalties over he said
7677451 im so sorry not just for lying to my friends and my family even about a sickness but im sorry for a life of saying im something im not from this day on im telling the truth
7677452 itinerate minister who held a credential with the australian christian churches
7677453 the national executive of the acc is taking this matter very seriously and is awaiting the results of the medical tests before determining the full extent of the discipline that will be imposed upon him
7677454 michael guglielmucci has not been a paid staff member of edge church for eight years
7677455 michael has lived in three other states of australia since leaving us and has been a minister on staff in two other churches since leaving our employ
7677456 he has not received any money from edge church international toward his alleged medical expenses
7677457 michaels lawyer has written to the police commissioner advising him of all pertinent information and notifying him of michael guglielmuccis intention to fully co operate with police inquiries
7677458 edge church is committed to the truth and honouring the people of our church our history has been one of integrity and openness we love the people of our community who have been actively involved in trying to bring life and hope to the hurting and the needy and will continue to do so
7677459 hope truth and love is not just our motto it is our life mission
7677460 for over 16 years i have struggled with an addiction to adult pornography as a result of this secret life of sin my body would often break down
7677461 two years ago i reported that i was suffering from cancer the truth is that although i was ill i did not have cancer but was again using the misdiagnosis to hide the lie that i was living
7677462 i have led you with openness and integrity and declare that we have not lived a lie before you

7677466 hay muchas formas de hacer un balance si evaluamos lo que ha sido el rendimiento deportivo a trav s del medallero sta fue
7677467 en el remo y en el tenis cre amos que era posible tener alg n finalista respondi en atletismo pas algo parecido si varios de los deportistas repet an las marcas con las cuales llegaron a beijing hubieran estado en las finales pero en definitiva
7677468 creo que el estado va dando muestras de apoyo hacia los deportistas pero una de nuestras asignaturas pendientes es crear un mecanismo para que los otros actores se involucren en el desarrollo del deporte uno de los actores principales para el desarrollo es la actividad privada desgraciadamente en la argentina salvo honrosas excepciones no se puede contar con ella
7677469 nosotros creemos que ahora s debe haber un cambio importante en el coa hay un dato que es muy claro el estado cuadruplic el presupuesto de 2003 a 2008 mientras que en el coa creo hubo un aumento del 7 por ciento en el per odo 2003 07
7677470 it sets a very chilling precedent that someone who is brought back gets the book thrown at them
7677471 i think it was a long sentence but it was positive that he got his day in court and got to speak up and say what he believed
7677472 his spirits were relatively good having two war resisters show up at his trial meant a lot to him
7677473 once soldiers are returned to military control it is in the best interest of everyone if there is support for war resisters
7677474 when the united states first attacked iraq i was told by my president that it was because of direct ties to al qaeda and weapons of mass destruction
7677475 i had a really sick feeling to my stomach when i heard about these things that went on
7677476 i knew that my conscience couldnt allow me to go over there to iraq
7677477 i have a son i wouldnt be able to see its kind of hard to think about that
7677478 we would hope that the canadian government allow the men and women who refuse to fight a war that canadians also refuse to fight to stay up there especially after seeing the heavy punishment that robin long faces
7677479 veterans and war resisters are beginning to see that they are in the same boat that they are brothers and sisters and it is one struggle
7677480 the fact that people are showing this kind of solidarity with each other is really profound resistance within the military is certainly growing
7677481 the blogger community was way ahead of the game in embracing new communications technologies and has completely changed the way news and information is disseminated in the 21st century
7677482 lately people are realizing that there may be a whole other leg of this credit market fallout that they havent anticipated yet
7677483 youre seeing a rolling problem that started two years ago in the mortgage business and we havent touched the bottom of the swimming pool in terms of the housing market
7677484 between all these factors i dont think you can make the argument that the broad market is at a compelling place to get in
7677485 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7677486 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7677487 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7677488 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate
7677489 obama has effectively checked mccain on mccains only relevant argument by choosing biden who has more foreign policy and washington experience than mccain

7677495 no thats how islam believes muhammad got the quran an angel is supposed to have come to muhammad and said write but thats never been how christians thought gods people got the bible insight from the holy spirit passed through the minds of human writers the important question is whether that insight got through intact and we believe it did
7677496 nope how about this in the old testament which you think is so warlike which qualities are most often attributed to god
7677497 prof are you sure youre not getting the two testaments mixed up
7677498 not at all both testaments are describing the same god but over the course of salvation history he discloses himself more and more fully it turns out that hes fierce with us because he loves us he has too much compassion to put up with our self destruction
7677499 you taught us that if were reading a book good enough to have survived for generations and if we find passages that seem inconsistent to us we shouldnt assume that they really are inconsistent until weve exhausted all the possibilities for um harmonizing them the confusion might not be in the book but in us
7677500 his lawyer insists hes as gentle as can be music with its arrogant swagger lack of self control and unbridled brutality suggests otherwise
7677501 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7677502 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7677503 sin el don de la vida no es posible ejercer otro derecho
7677504 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border
7677505 cbp is on heightened alert ever since we became aware of the threats in mexico
7677506 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7677507 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7677508 neither one of them can win but both of them can make the other lose
7677509 i just dont see how theres going to be any stand down by either one of them thats going to turn the campaign in another direction
7677510 when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track he couldnt remember
7677511 now hes a convicted felon facing jail thats a housing problem
7677512 were not going to shy away from making the contrast people are making a choice we need to make clear what that choice is
7677513 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7677514 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7677515 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7677516 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7677517 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7677518 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7677519 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7677520 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7677521 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7677522 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7677523 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
7677524 the list of artists and contributors who have graced the pages of arkitip now reads like a whos who of popular culture many of which received exposure in arkitip long before the mainstream took notice

7677526 im tasting all that is possible i try to eat the food do the things i should but lifes so short my friend i hate missing out on something good this year i realized how old i was she grinned ive got to try those things that for years i had ignored
7677527 i want what she is having only add some more whipped cream
7677528 cowardice asks the question is it safe expediency asks the question is it politic vanity asks the question is it popular but conscience asks the question is it right and there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe nor politic nor popular but one must take it because it is right
7677529 never cease in the fight for peace justice and equality for all people be persistent in all that you do and dont allow anyone to sway you from your conscience
7677530 we have less margin of error for georgia than we do in minnesota and wisconsin
7677531 we are confident that georgia which has a trend of electing republican candidates will remain a red state
7677532 john kerry made absolutely no investment in the state and he finished with 42 percent of the vote
7677533 between record african american vote and 400 000 people the campaign intends to register theres no reason our percentages cant go into the high 40s we can win with 48 or 49 percent
7677534 i think youre setting your sights very high and that maybe you should consider this
7677535 cultural educational scientific and administrative resources as well as technical medical and other kinds of information created digitally or converted into digital form from existing analogue resources
7677536 if the seahawks are planning on getting off to a good opening season this year they defintely need to start working on that tonight or next week that means start running the football with the guys
7677537 who are the wide receivers who is the running backs and who is the head coach
7677538 podr a considerarse si no se aplican los medios necesarios para evitarlo que las extradiciones de los principales responsables de las autodefensas unidas puede ser un obst culo insalvable para la aplicaci n de justicia y paz y se har a necesaria la intervenci n de la fiscal a de la corte penal internacional y en su caso mediante la aplicaci n del principio de justicia penal universal que otros sistemas judiciales
7677539 por lo tanto deber n implementarse los medios a trav s de acuerdos con las autoridades norteamericanas
7677540 que se llegue con todas las garant as penales a los funcionarios p blicos que hayan podido prestar apoyo o aprovechado de los criminales y por eso el sistema judicial necesita credibilidad
7677541 it just keeps it interesting for me as a human being and as an artist to try some other shit that i havent tried yet
7677542 i dont really know where i fit in i dont really know where i stand and i dont really care i like being away from everything
7677543 i like to listen to stuff that sounds like shit that im not really doing
7677544 after its all said and done and the smoke settles usually i find that im not really into the stuff that i release after it comes out it feels old but i said what i said and im proud of it
7677545 this was inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign
7677546 all three swimmers are very remorseful and have apologised to team management for what was poor judgement on their part and accept the punishment handed down
7677547 i aint pro human because all humans aint pro black
7677548 im comfortable with anybody who wants to gut it out but if that isnt enough for us to win then i have to make a decision about that
7677549 you have a young pitcher whos 27 years old and hes trying to pitch differently than he did earlier in the year in terms of his velocity and that type of thing
7677550 but john maine wants to pitch he wants to gut it out and weve been assured he cant injure himself more than he has

7677554 it will not advance and it will not be approved because the prd and the pri the former ruling party are not going to support the privatization of refineries and pipelines
7677555 every month every year that we dont agree postpones the solution
7677556 so we may be running out of oil before we get to what this reform is promising
7677557 in virtually every case we dont discuss an athletes sexual orientation
7677558 not in every case not every athlete has a personal discussion i could show you 500 athletes we didnt show we dont show everyone we dont show every ceremony
7677559 how do you know that how do you know that someone on the rowing team doesnt have as compelling a story
7677560 its not possible to cover the entire personal story of every athlete regarding their performance
7677561 looking back on the weekend i think we competed very well against two good teams and that is a huge positive we had some nice moments and we some players come in and perform well under pressure there were a lot of positive things that came out of it
7677562 i am anxious and eager to see how we perform in our first home games of the year now that we have two games under our belt i want to see if we can continue to improve we have so many new players they may not remember what it was like to play arizona but i think they will enjoy it
7677563 arizona will play a passing style just like wake forest georgia will be another good measuring stick for us too they have a quality team that plays good soccer and they will test us i think the players will enjoy playing a team from another part of the country all of our players are really excited to play a game at home under the lights
7677564 i think it showed good grit and competitiveness from our player that we were fighting all the way until the end of those games i think the players were pleased with sunday even though it didnt go our way the whole game we hung in there and found a way to win and we didnt do that a year ago i certainly dont want to play 20 overtime games but it was a positive that the athletes got more minutes out there i think that will serve us well later in the year when we get to conference play
7677565 de la lectura del documento considero que se debe investigar estas relaciones y comunicaciones ya que se puede estar frente a una conducta punible
7677566 esto quiere decir que el precio de los tub rculos sobre todo la papa de una gran cantidad de cereales sobre todo el arroz del que es saliendo la cosecha m s grande de todos los tiempos ha ca do y eso le proptege el bolsillo a los consumidores
7677567 es decir se est materializando lo que se ha dicho
7677568 a pesar del paro camionero se pudo dar esta ca da en los precios de todos estos alimentos
7677569 durante 2007 y en lo corrido de 2008 los alimentos han desempe ado un papel protag nico en el comportamiento general del ipc ndice de precios al consumidor debido a que sus ajustes han estado por encima de las metas de infl aci n fijadas por el banco
7677570 en n meses recientes las expectativas de inflaci n siguen aumentando y contin an la tendencia que muestra la inflaci n al consumidor
7677571 las expectativas a diciembre de 2008 obtenidas a partir de la encuesta mensual que aplica el banco se situaron a comienzos de julio en 6 7
7677572 este aumento es superior al registrado por la inflaci n total en el mismo per odo para el caso de las expectativas a un a o el dato m s reciente se sit a en 5 5 lo que es 70 pb puntos b sicos m s que lo reportado un trimestre atr s
7677573 uno de los riesgos m s altos que enfrenta la estabilidad de la inflaci n en colombia hacia el largo plazo es el aumento de las expectativas
7677574 este fen meno puede alentar incrementos de precios por encima de las metas establecidas por el banco en lo que resta del a o y a comienzos de 2009 especialmente si la credibilidad de la pol tica monetaria es baja tal como lo sugieren las encuestas
7677575 we knew it she wasnt vetted its just the facts we sorta knew it so im not upset i knew it and im excited about joe biden i think hes a great pick hillary is excited she is ready to campaign she went to nevada she went to florida she went to california she has raised millions of dollars for the obama campaign she is doing everything
7677576 good afternoon ladies and gentlemen our flight into sacramento is on time so as soon as the plane empties out well begin boarding just so you know there are only about 54 people booked on this flight so it looks as if it will be a comfortable ride
7677577 im really keen to keep playing one day cricket at least for this summer
7677578 i really enjoy it so providing i can hold my spot i will definitely be playing more one day cricket
7677579 its not like ive played 300 games i came late to one day cricket and have played about 150 161 games
7677580 i want to finish off the desire i have to play one day cricket without being selfish because its important the team has plenty of time to prepare for the next world cup
7677581 thats still a long way off but i wont be ruthless about trying to push on i dont want to hang on too long
7677582 in the short term its disappointing but in the longer term its really good because it gives me extra time to get right for india
7677583 india is a hugely challenging and iconic series there have been a lot of distractions lately with the rise of twenty20 cricket but the premium product is still test cricket and one of the premium events is playing india
7677584 ricky is coming along well he came down here yesterday and hit a few balls so i think he is slowly but surely getting there
7677585 any time he is ready to come back we are well and truly waiting for him
7677586 i think all the guys have been in contact with brett whether its been via text or rung him hes pretty busy at the moment with a few things on his plate if he needs anybody to talk to im well and truly here
7677587 thats obviously a great result for all the players just to find out whether we are going or not going
7677588 at this time due to an ncaa eligibility center issue
7677589 sag doch mal was ber hm naja hmmm china und vielleicht noch ja h naja vielleicht doping ja genau das isses sag doch mal was zu doping
7677590 ja wer wei wie das jetzt wieder zustande gekommen ist man wei ja nicht aber genaues k nnen wir dazu leider nicht sagen
7677591 the leader of the opposition has broken off communication with the prime minister for three weeks and this is clearly a sign of noncooperation
7677592 thats always been our intention at the end of the day the government needs to be able to govern but if thats not possible then somebody needs to get a mandate in order to govern
7677593 they came at us last monday with an e mail asking us for a meeting we responded we would get back to them today so we proposed a date
7677594 hes manufacturing some crisis about a dysfunctional parliament they wanted a meeting before the house returns and were proposing to meet before the house returns
7677595 we recognize the pain suffered by mr healys family over his tragic passing
7677596 we hope the settlement brings them some measure of closure
7677597 we only know the engine had problems and they did not make a successful landing
7677598 theres not a thing he can do at this point were working with the u s embassy to have all of the arrangements made for the repatriation of those who are deceased and medical flights for those living
7677599 there were farmers in the field where they crashed they pulled my husband out of the plane 30 seconds before the plane exploded
7677600 he has constant pain he says he can deal with hes just grateful to be alive
7677601 he did everything he was a carpenter a multipurpose utility player he was a very popular employee forever upbeat
7677602 he was very giving i think he was in africa last year
7677603 if you talk to warren buffett hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
7677604 not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work
7677605 can you help me i dont know what to do with this
7677606 you called and i came running thinking something was wrong or something
7677607 oh god graphing equations there are so many easier ways to do this

7677610 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7677611 it could be that the safety benefits of driving slower are proportionately greater than the fuel economy benefits
7677612 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7677613 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7677614 likewise at times strange luminous streaks appear aloft known as noctilucent clouds
7677615 im doing this because my husbands running for president of the united states
7677616 family is first for us and it will always be that way
7677617 hes a wonderful man hes a gifted man but in the end hes just a man
7677618 i want to publicly proclaim my love and adoration for my wife michelle obama
7677619 i knew then and there there was something special about this guy
7677620 for the first time in my adult lifetime im really proud of my country
7677621 this is a man who used to swim and box and run served in the military one day woke up and couldnt walk
7677622 i never knew him to be a man who could walk without the aid of crutches
7677623 my challenges are much more public but theyre the same as most women and we need to figure this out
7677624 how do we define roles for ourselves as women that are healthy and balanced and make sense
7677625 e inutile gli fate schifo e detto fra noi lo capisco
7677626 da tanti anni che qua la prima volta che la vedo fare una cosa simile
7677627 non ne ho idea qua da un bel pezzo ancora prima che venissi io a tenere il locale non ti so dire
7677628 e alquanto schiva sinceramente e difficile avvicinarla gli starete simpatici
7677629 ah ma lei sa cos successo qua nel venire abbiamo visto dei vigili del fuoco andarsene da questa zona
7677630 si si crollata una casa disabitata hanno controllato che fosse tutto a posto e se ne sono andati
7677631 oh ma non ti ho ancora detto niente che stronzo
7677632 dai impossibile che non ci sia in tutta la rete una sola informazione su sto stronzo
7677633 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
7677634 not that he should have known the rules he did know
7677635 a unique technology that has not been applied successfully to an airplane
7677636 the air force has increased the sheer volume of pilots put through the training pipeline and shipped them off to war with the bare minimum training required
7677637 have come directly from basic training as their first exposure to the professional workforce
7677638 this is stuff we can correct through training stuff that happens between the ears
7677639 flight safety is of paramount importance to the air force and every mishap is carefully studied in order to mitigate future risk
7677640 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7677641 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7677642 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7677643 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7677644 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7677645 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7677646 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7677647 look how long it takes the police or anybody else to get here
7677648 if someone wants to come here and harm someone at least we would have sort of defense
7677649 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
7677650 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7677651 theyre stirring up a little hate and discontent with that deal
7677652 its like putting up a barrier weve all intermingled for years
7677653 it was freer before but we live in a different world now
7677654 weve gotten more aircraft more vehicles more boats more atvs pretty much everything weve got more and weve got more people to man them
7677655 this may have been mayberry before but its not anymore
7677656 it is a story for children of all ages writing itself with each drawing
7677657 but you must not forget it you become responsible forever for what you have tamed
7677658 in some cases the most important thing a leader can do is to pick a side and stick to it
7677659 imagine what would happen in the u s if none of us knew which side of the road to drive on
7677660 you dont want the president saying one day everyone drive on the right and the next day everyone drive on the left
7677661 if we stay we risk building resentment against the u s if we go we risk iraqi security
7677662 this might incur both risks since it makes iraqis think we are an arbitrary occupier and it makes terrorists think we could be persuaded to leave under pressure
7677663 in other words either coordinated outcome stay or go is better than the uncoordinated one maybe well stay maybe well go
7677664 if the facts change or if situations change then a legitimate public official or a policy analyst or a citizen voting for a candidate would want to know that
7677665 if a situation has changed maybe its a good thing that the opinions have changed
7677666 voters would like to think that their elected officials are being honest
7677667 but i think most voters understand that elected officials have a legitimate reason to want to change their views on issues in a world thats constantly changing and in a political system where in order to get things done you have to sometimes compromise
7677668 thats different from being a hypocrite or being a liar or having a different public view from your private view
7677669 this is spiritually corrupt how can you take songs of the world and transform them into praises
7677670 this saddens me it appeals to the flesh no doubt and is outer court worship
7677671 for 12 years congressman kenny hulshof has been part of the problem in washington
7677672 the result missouri has the highest unemployment in a decade
7677673 bank repossessions or reos continued to be the fastest growing segment of foreclosure activity in july posting a 184 percent year over year increase compared to a 53 percent year over year increase in default notices and an 11 percent year over year increase in auction notices
7677674 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale realtytrac now has more than three quarters of a million properties in its active reo database a number that represents approximately 17 percent of the inventory of existing homes for sale reported in june by the national association of realtors

7677682 i never thought the guys would be so sad for brad bellick
7677683 whatever this is we can find a way to manage it we just need to know what were dealing with
7677684 i recently got the news that he passed away heart attack where was he still in that prison may he rest in peace
7677685 it would be best if you get some rest where you can be monitored
7677686 this morning the greatest scientific instrument since galileos telescope has reached another great milestone its 100 000th orbit around the earth
7677687 hubble has given us amazing insight into the origins of our universe and im so proud of the men and women at goddard and the space telescope science institute for their contributions and dedication to these great discoveries the entire world is looking forward to the hubble servicing mission in october 2008 when hubble will get new scientific instruments new batteries and new gyroscopes the servicing mission will extend hubbles life and give it a more powerful view of our universe hubble is the telescope that could and its best years are ahead of it
7677688 have a good first day and a wonderful first year
7677689 no one would ever guess this was your first year teaching elementary its going to be a fantastic year and these kids are going to do great things

7677691 project 119 which was designed to train athletes in medal rich sports in order to get their medal count up
7677692 my publicist has advised me not to let anyone take pictures of me
7677693 they read like something your wacky art teacher would write in your yearbook
7677694 if for nothing i wanted to tell you this and more than anything to tell you from me to keep going always even in silence never stop hold on listen always even in silence youll be ok
7677695 the mechanical properties of six highly conductive copper alloys grcop 84 amzirc glidcop al 15 cu 1cr 0 1zr cu 0 9cr and narloy z were compared tests were done on as received hard drawn material and after a heat treatment designed to simulate a brazing operation at 935 degrees c in the as received condition amzirc glidcop al 15 cu 1cr 0 1zr and cu 0 9cr had excellent strengths at temperatures below 500 degrees c however the brazing heat treatment substantially decreased the mechanical properties of amzirc cu 1cr 0 1zr cu 0 9cr and narloy z
7677696 the properties of glidcop al 15 and grcop 84 were not significantly affected by the heat treatment thus there appear to be advantages to grcop 84 over amzirc cu 1cr 0 1zr cu 0 9cr and narloy z if use or processing temperatures greater than 500 degrees c are expected ductility was the lowest in glidcop al 15 and cu 0 9cr reduction in area was particularly low in glidcop al 15 above 500 degrees c and as received cu 0 9cr was brittle between 500 and 650 degrees c tensile creep tests were done at 500 and 650 degrees c the creep properties of grcop 84 were superior to those of brazed amzirc cu 1cr 0 1zr cu 0 9cr and narloy z
7677697 in the brazed condition grcop 84 was superior to the other alloys due to its greater strength and creep resistance compared to amzirc cu 1cr 0 1zr cu 0 9cr and narloy z and ductility compared to glidcop al 15
7677698 its been a tough start and the only consolation is that weve played the two teams who i am sure are going to slug out the championship again
7677699 i think united will get dimitar berbatov from tottenham in the next few days and they will be even stronger than they already are
7677700 but chelsea are really strong too and arsenal and liverpool have got it all to do to finish above those two
7677701 we showed some promise in the first half but then we ran out of steam
7677702 i was a bit afraid because i took a chance with a few players sean davis has hardly kicked a ball in pre season because of injury younes kaboul has missed a complete pre season and armand traore was out with a knock at arsenal before he came here
7677703 we did okay and i came in at half time feeling pleased but when the pace went out of the game in the second half people like carlos tevez and wayne rooney popped the ball about and we couldnt deal with it
7677704 weve been a decent team over the last two seasons and i believe well still be a good team this season but uniteds touch and movement was a bit too much for us
7677705 weve got to provide quicker service for peter crouch hes a bit disappointed but hes also got to help us out by winning a few more headers
7677706 when we settle down and understand each other a bit more well be okay
7677707 we played some excellent football its a difficult place to come
7677708 we tried to get a system where the players were comfortable in their positions we used the players in the right way
7677709 theres only a week to go before the transfer deadline and you start to concern yourself
7677710 i didnt forgot about shaun the problem was he wasnt playing at aston villa
7677711 i was at the game on saturday and shaun was excellent so he certainly comes back into my thoughts
7677712 it looks as if he has a new lease of life
7677713 hes back playing which is the important thing because if you are not playing then it is very difficult to maintain sharpness but he certainly looked sharp on saturday
7677714 i am going to announce the squad on wednesday and he comes into consideration
7677715 we have had three good work outs where we have learned a lot
7677716 the biggest problem is getting my full team out but nevertheless we had some good workouts and that will stand us in good stead for the qualifiers
7677717 we are not inundated with world class players a lot of our key players have been missing and thats been our biggest headache
7677718 we havent qualified for a major tournament for 10 years and people talk about friendlies but we havent won a friendly at hampden in 12 years so it was always going to be difficult
7677719 but i feel we have a good squad of players and we will give it our best shot
7677720 its been black and white from day one with the sfa
7677721 the national team comes first and at the moment we are keen to keep our nationality intact
7677722 we have to have a national scottish team and we cant put that in jeopardy so there has been no change
7677723 ive been wanting to talk to you for a long ive been so
7677724 mother bear you know youre the only furry in my life why are you suddenly asking all these questions

7677727 mother bear you know im a fisherman i go when the fish are biting

7677756 repeatedly and in many different contexts we have warned that courts must not presume to determine the place of a particular belief in a religion or the plausibility of a religious claim
7677757 it is no more appropriate for judges to determine the centrality of religious beliefs before applying a compelling interest test in the free exercise field than it would be for them to determine the importance of ideas before applying the compelling interest test in the free speech field
7677758 courts should not undertake to dissect religious beliefs because the believers beliefs are not articulated with the clarity and precision that a more sophisticated person might employ
7677759 does not permit a court to determine whether the belief or practice in question is compelled by or central to a system of religious belief
7677760 then render to caesar the things that are caesars and to god the things that are gods

7677804 the thing that coble wanted was karen vicha and the thing that stood between him and her was bobby vicha and the vicha family
7677805 this is the most difficult decision since ive been here
7677806 ive had more than 1 person come to me and say why dont you just give this guy life without parole surely the victims will be ok with that sort of suggesting you cant be gay and be for the death penalty
7677807 i cant speak about what it was in the past but its not that now
7677808 what appears to have happened with warren is that this tragedy has now made him one of theirs
7677809 im out here in a gay wasteland and heres a guy who was smart who had seen the world and also you know i was hurting and he was hurting and we were able to be there for each other
7677810 i think it makes people aware that the loss of a partner in a gay relationship is the same as the loss of a partner in a straight relationship
7677811 thats a side of my brother ive never seen warren with a wrench in his hands would be like me sitting at a sewing machine
7677812 to see him take off and go like hes gone its just unbelievable
7677813 warren are you keeping this because of robs memory or are you staying here because you want to stay here
7677814 thats when i started to look at the deal a whole lot different
7677815 it makes me be more accepting of people for what they are and the way that they are i mean it just made me stop and think all the years i was prejudiced all the slang terms i used over the years loosely just like warren said its not just a physical thing its the companionship you look at how many people who go through life and never find true love
7677816 i dont feel real comfortable talking about it but unfortunately for our family it took this for us to acknowledge warrens lifestyle for us as a family to all sit down and talk about it
7677817 at some point im going to have to go through all this again
7677818 im not worried you know im lucky as hell when it comes to stuff like this
7677819 its kind of a surreal feeling when youre prepared for it to go one way and today its over its almost like christmas
7677820 i havent had time to emotionally process all this news yet
7677821 this confessed killer sits here now in front of us facing a sentence of life in prison without parole
7677822 i sit here with three life sentences the rest of my life without my partner robert king whiteside the memory of my discovering roberts body lying dead face down in a pool of blood which i will live with the rest of my life and a life forever changed emotionally financially and with a lost sense of security due to a cruelty and total disregard for human life
7677823 i thought if i did sell the property would i stay in the area or not thats become more of a valid question in the last couple of months because im becoming more and more ingrained now in the community and with the people that i know out here i mean this has become my home
7677824 its really sad that it took what happened with robert for that to
7677825 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible
7677826 ive moved down to the beach with tito i love being by the beach
7677827 ovviamente e facile quando le cose vanno bene chiunque e vicino a te e ti abbraccia e ti dice che sei il numero uno ma quando improvvisamente devi affrontare delle situazioni difficili tutti ti dicono che e gia finita questo non e il caso di kimi lui e il campione del mondo noi siamo una squadra e noi supportiamo tutti nel gruppo e soprattutto kimi perch crediamo in lui al 100 nei momenti piu difficili che la squadra deve stare unita non abbiamo alcun dubbio sulla prestazione di kimi sono assolutamente sicuro che fara il suo ritorno tra il prossimo gp e la finale in brasile
7677828 e stata comminata una multa alla squadra non al pilota ad essere onesti non pensiamo sia stata una manovra azzardata come si puo vedere non cerano ostacoli e rallentamenti force india lha fatto inserire ma questo e il punto di vista della stefano in ultimo si sofferma sul motore andato in fumo sul rettuilineo divalencia ungheria per felipe non ce nulla di certo abbiamo visto di nuovo il fumo sul rettilineo principale ora stiamo smontando il motore per capire quale sia stato il vero problema percio non posso darvi una risposta sicura sulla natura dellaccaduto perch i ragazzi stanno ancora lavorando sul motore ma non ce stato nulla di cui preoccuparsi
7677829 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

7677848 compared against ourselves product revenue was up 32 per cent in euro and 44 per cent in us dollars
7677849 we feel the uptake of enterprise support will be successful from talking to customers
7677850 we got a tremendous response from new customers and we feel rather at ease and will be working with each of our customers and user groups to make sure they recognize the value of this offering
7677851 were offering a new service which is much larger than before has a certain value and a certain price

7677861 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7677862 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7677863 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7677864 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7677865 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7677866 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7677867 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7677868 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7677869 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

7677875 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7677876 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7677877 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7677878 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

7677883 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7677884 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7677885 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7677886 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7677887 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7677888 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7677889 blogging will at some point be a little anachronistic i communicate my number one job as a leader of a company is to communicate you used to communicate by being the celebrity ceo you flew around and spoke with heads of state and got local media to cover it and got your message out in an inefficient and environmentally irresponsible way then the internet came along and gave you access to the whole planet all at the same time so why not use the internet as a way to communicate directly and authentically to the marketplace then i will have satisfied at least one portion of my job
7677890 you can communicate in many different ways through your actions through your products the way i communicate is by using the spoken and written word
7677891 i dont think ive ever terrified our pr department but ive terrified our securities department once or twice and theyve been very quick about telling me to put in a safe harbor statement at the beginning of the post and then they make an sec filing based on what i just said but now were very practiced about this and thats no longer the norm i can get away with a link to a safe harbor statement now
7677892 the most terrifying day for me as a blogger was when our general counsel started writing a blog

7677896 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7677897 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7677898 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7677899 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7677900 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7677901 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7677902 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7677903 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7677904 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7677905 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7677906 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7677907 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7677908 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7677909 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7677910 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7677911 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7677912 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7677913 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7677914 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
7677915 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
7677916 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7677917 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7677918 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7677919 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7677920 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7677921 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7677922 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7677923 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7677924 we understand the essence of the russian position and its military response
7677925 theyre all seriously worried that its georgia today and one of them tomorrow
7677926 poland and the us signed a deal to build a controversial missile defence shield in eastern europe
7677927 the agreement highlights how russias invasion of georgia has prompted a swift reappraisal of the regions security and alliances the us and poland have been talking about the missile shield for a year but rushed to cement their alliance in the wake of this weeks conflict
7677928 tried and failed just before leaving for europe on monday 7 july to seal a deal to place missiles in poland the state department said
7677929 the statements of some nato representatives that the maneuvers of the alliances ships in the black sea were planned a year ago are evidence that attacks on south ossetia and abkhazia were planned earlier maybe even last year
7677930 now that the conflict with south ossetia is exhausted there are nato vessels in the black sea what for and with what aim
7677931 i thought they would kill us i was very much afraid
7677932 georgian units are concentrated in the central part of the republic and are preparing for further actions
7677933 georgian special forces are setting up arms caches in order among other things to carry out provocations on the territory of south ossetia and neighboring districts
7677934 doctors cant tell me how they died i was only told their bodies were picked up on the road by russian troops and delivered here to tskhinvali morgue but its very mysterious
7677935 other journalists have joined us here our friends from ap reuters france press and time are here now and we all see it as our duty to complete this
7677936 working conditions for journalists were terrible of all the war conflicts in the post soviet space and the balkans this was the worst time for journalists
7677937 the united states is our great friend they have arrived at such a difficult time it means we are not alone
7677938 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the ceasefire agreement
7677939 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7677940 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7677941 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7677942 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
7677943 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support and also consulting on how these leaders in the region see the future playing out
7677944 thats something that obviously we are going to have to evaluate given the current situation i dont have any announcements on that one way or another
7677945 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7677946 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7677947 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7677948 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7677949 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7677950 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7677951 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7677952 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7677953 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7677954 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7677955 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7677956 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7677957 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7677958 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7677959 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7677960 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7677961 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7677962 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7677963 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7677964 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7677965 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7677966 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7677967 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7677968 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7677969 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7677970 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7677971 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7677972 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7677973 who are open to doing something on the production side
7677974 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7677975 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7677976 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7677977 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

7677981 i hope the decision to allow these students to travel to cyprus will help to legitimise this passage between gaza and cyprus to actually open a route that would allow people here freedom of movement
7677982 its also very significant that this free gaza protest that succeeded in getting here not just be forgotten but rather be the first in a series of steps to break the siege

7678017 inflation expectations are one of the most important factors in the economic environment
7678018 so if consumers lose confidence that could bring us into a bad economic situation

7678037 i think western pressure already put on russia has had its effect
7678038 it works and it will work because russia depends on the west its not the soviet union that was self sufficient russia will have to somehow learn how to play by internationally recognized rules they cannot go unpunished
7678039 they dont have any right to do so they might attempt it testing the patience of the georgian government as well as the western allies
7678040 they will try to go as far as they are allowed i dont think its implementable but they might say something like that they might demand such stupid action
7678041 they want to strangle the georgian economy to make the georgian people as unhappy as possible in order for them to turn against their own government
7678042 its basically a subversion plan carried out by russian government against sovereign georgia
7678043 i think it recognises the importance of her race of 18 million people voting for her

7678045 we will be looking for cues in what she says
7678046 the last few times she expressed support for obama people picked up that she still wants delegates to fight for her
7678047 my sense is that we will lose hundreds of delegates

7678058 im really keen to keep playing one day cricket at least for this summer
7678059 i really enjoy it so providing i can hold my spot i will definitely be playing more one day cricket
7678060 its not like ive played 300 games i came late to one day cricket and have played about 150 161 games
7678061 i want to finish off the desire i have to play one day cricket without being selfish because its important the team has plenty of time to prepare for the next world cup
7678062 thats still a long way off but i wont be ruthless about trying to push on i dont want to hang on too long
7678063 in the short term its disappointing but in the longer term its really good because it gives me extra time to get right for india

7678072 what keeps me going is my outrage at the inequities that persist in our country
7678073 bowlers have used sweat and polish over the years to shine the ball
7678074 there is an old wives tale from past years that sunscreen and brylcreem helps the ball swing but i dont know about that
7678075 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7678076 and through trial and error i finally settled on the type of spit for the task at hand
7678077 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7678078 i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7678079 no one shall rub the ball on the ground use any artificial substance or take any other action to alter the condition of the ball
7678080 thats ancient history and were not going to breathe life into the dust of ancient history
7678081 right now we are looking forward to playing bangladesh in darwin and our chance will come over the next 15 months to play against the poms in england
7678082 it actually doesnt bother me at all right now we are looking forward thats history
7678083 i cant believe that a guy who didnt even play in the series has come out with such a comment
7678084 if hed been someone that had played in the series then fair enough because he might have seen something
7678085 over the last century or so bowlers have been fiddling around with balls using all sorts of stuff
7678086 i dont think that trescothicks revelation is earth shattering news bowlers have used saliva sun screen lip balm all sorts of things
7678087 going back to keith millers day there were suggestions they used hair cream on the ball
7678088 things like lip ice have been around since i was playing schoolboy cricket
7678089 there have been substances used on cricket balls ever since ive known the game
7678090 the big thing is the scratching on one side making it shiny on one side and rough on the other so it swings
7678091 the scratching of the ball is the big issue rather than what goes on the shiny side

7678141 we have come across axon in many situations and respect the way the company is run we are not able to say exactly how the two companies will be integrated yet as that is something we will have to discuss with its management but we are confident they will continue to grow strongly once a deal is completed
7678142 about 28pc of our business comes from europe and the uk plays an important role in that across the services we offer we already work with clients in areas like finance and retail and by adding axon we will become even stronger
7678143 uk consumer spending looks very vulnerable and retrenchment could be both severe and long lived
7678144 how bad will the uk recession get its difficult to know the fact that excesses in the housing market and in consumer spending look as if they have far to unravel suggests that it is likely to continue well into 2009
7678145 the early 1980s recession saw the level of gdp fall 6pc from peak to trough while the early 1990s recession saw a 2 5pc fall in both cases once the gross domestic product stopped contracting it took more than a year before growth recovered to a trend pace or above
7678146 to businesses and consumers it could feel like a recession as their spending power will be constrained profits will shrink and unemployment will rise
7678147 even if we avoid a technical recession its going to feel pretty recession like with sharp rises in unemployment and falling real incomes
7678148 opinions differ even on the mpc as to whether such a rebalancing is necessary or whether the uk economy could go on relying on credit fuelled consumption for its gdp growth those who take the latter view advocate us style slashing of interest rates aimed at reviving the credit markets
7678149 china has used the pretext of reserve requirement hikes to help slow yuan appreciation we estimate that the pboc central bank intervened by about 49 6bn in june
7678150 they are now more worried about growth than overheating and you are seeing that play out in the currency markets there has been a remarkable change of view

7678155 plummeting zinc prices have taken casualties along the way including aim resources which has placed its perkoa zinc project on a care and maintenance programme
7678156 it has almost been a bear market for aim since last summer some miners have fallen horrifically some have halved in value
7678157 you can see many of the junior miners need to raise cash so why invest in a company that needs to raise cash to explore there is also an aversion to risk and aim miners are quite high risk
7678158 are ripe for xstratas picking should the lonmin bid fail

7678161 four years ago norm coleman had no problem standing up for bush and cheney in boston where his actions and words were so embarrassing and outlandish that the media needed to call him out for his disgusting behavior
7678162 as democrats from throughout the country gather to unify and work to get our nation back on track pawlenty seeks to create greater division and discord
7678163 the question minnesotans will ask themselves this week is this will pawlenty embarrass us as much as coleman did four years ago
7678164 arizona sen jon kyl and minnesota gov tim pawlenty will speak on behalf of their party and the mccain campaign during the critical days of the democratic national convention
7678165 we do however have a problem with colemans behavior in boston on behalf of the bush campaign the senator has morphed into an attack dog for president bush and in the process he has demeaned the u s senate and embarrassed many of his constituents
7678166 its one thing for coleman to introduce bush at a twin cities rally or to appear at a republican convention to extol bushs virtues and bash the opposition its quite another for him to behave as though he were a republican political operative taking cues from karl rove
7678167 its disgusting behavior and it would be equally disgusting if sen mark dayton were to show up at the republican convention in a similar role for kerry this isnt the only way in which coleman has carried such poisonous political water for bush but it is the worst coleman owes an apology to the senate and to the constituents who elected him and expected him to serve decorously in this nations most august political body
7678168 one of the most effective spokesmen and advocate for the presidents message
7678169 basically when i was diagnosed with metastatic disease there was no viable chemotherapy option there was no viable surgical option
7678170 so what we do with radio surgery is give a lethal dose to the tumor but avoid as much as possible the surrounding normal tissue
7678171 there was some challenge in that process of okay hold your breath wait for the radiation to be delivered and go on to the next

7678179 patient and outreach services from rochester general hospital the women youre about to meet offer a very personal approach to the serious problem of being uninsured
7678180 ive talked to the mccain campaign a little bit about the issue but certainly not about me being in that mix

7678188 a great american story modest means but big dreams and encouragement from loving parents
7678189 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the centre of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night

7678200 a lot of the motorcycles are sitting right in school zones and i am looking out for people who are going too fast
7678201 the reason why we want to slow people down is to make it safer for the kids
7678202 it increases peoples reaction time when they are at a slower speed
7678203 lots of people on cell phones their focus just changes
7678204 it doesnt matter if you are going two miles over the speed limit or ten miles over the speed limit its the same price
7678205 worf could hang onto it with one hand and swing it pretty hard
7678206 i cannot remember i know there was something but i just cannot remember what happened
7678207 im very proud of every point of my 239 batting average
7678208 everyone has been made for some particular work and the desire for that work has been put in every heart
7678209 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7678210 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7678211 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7678212 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7678213 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7678214 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7678215 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7678216 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7678217 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7678218 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7678219 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7678220 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7678221 some christians sow to the flesh every day and wonder why they do not reap holiness
7678222 dont just sit there and waste your precious time when you want to do something do it right away do it when you can its the only way to live a life without regrets
7678223 the ipod touch would probably drop to 149 which would mean the ipod nanos could drop to 49 for the 4gb 99 for the 16gb then the shuffles could be bumped off
7678224 the bottom line from my perspective is the surgery went well

7678258 5 cover allows a talented filmmaker like craig to use technologies that change the way audiences consume and engage in content
7678259 rather than using all the new screens as simply additional distribution platforms we are building an entirely new interactive experience that makes connections between the audience and content more meaningful
7678260 content is now a click away and distribution platforms can fit in the palm of your hand
7678261 for me its always been memphis music and musicians and now people from around the world at any time of the day on a multitude of devices will be able to click and snack in my own backyard with some of the coolest cats this side of the mississippi river

7678273 michael guglielmucci has not been a paid staff member of edge church for eight years
7678274 michael has lived in three other states of australia since leaving us and has been a minister on staff in two other churches since leaving our employ
7678275 he has not received any money from edge church international toward his alleged medical expenses
7678276 michaels lawyer has written to the police commissioner advising him of all pertinent information and notifying him of michael guglielmuccis intention to fully co operate with police inquiries
7678277 edge church is committed to the truth and honouring the people of our church our history has been one of integrity and openness we love the people of our community who have been actively involved in trying to bring life and hope to the hurting and the needy and will continue to do so

7678279 for over 16 years i have struggled with an addiction to adult pornography as a result of this secret life of sin my body would often break down
7678280 two years ago i reported that i was suffering from cancer the truth is that although i was ill i did not have cancer but was again using the misdiagnosis to hide the lie that i was living
7678281 i have led you with openness and integrity and declare that we have not lived a lie before you
7678282 obviously it was the wrong thing to do but im proud that hes come out and admitted it

7678286 my mum did not know why i was taking so long to walk home i did not want to worry her because she has to work
7678287 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7678288 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7678289 there is no feminine for avuncular but there ought to be i want in auntly fashion to praise michelle de kretser for being good and beautiful while scolding her for being afraid to show her goodness and beauty what do you want to hide behind all that face paint for child do you think you have to be as skinny as a pencil and wear a ring in your navel just because other people do the fashionable disfigurements and artificialities i complain of are of course literary and they affect not her but her novel the lost dog kretsers native style is clear vigorous sensitive to mood and cadence and strongly narrative an excellent tool for a novelist with a story to tell
7678290 this books insights are at times so thickly layered as to leave character story and reader gasping for light and air which isnt to say theyre necessarily bad insights more often than not de kretser nails some situation or foible in 20 words or less consider her observation on 9 11 everything changes when americans fall from the sky as de kretser showed with her second novel the hamilton case her forte is illuminating the lives of such leftovers of empire and she provides more of those delights here but this novel also continues a steady move away from the concrete world of places and events toward the human interior
7678291 this is the best novel i have read for a long time the writing is elegant and subtle and michelle de kretser knows how to construct a gripping story this writing is new and constantly surprising without being showy or quirky it is exact like penelope fitzgerald it is strange like patrick white
7678292 while the plot is subtle the books musings on modernity are anything but nearly every page offers observations on how contemporary western life attempts to efface the past faddish dress gentrified neighborhoods the disposability of old technology
7678293 in many ways this book is wonderfully mysterious the whole concept of modernity juxtaposed with animality is a puzzle that kept this reader on edge for the entire reading the lost dog is an intelligent and insightful book that will guarantee de kretser a loyal following
7678294 ranging between the present and events of the past whose convergence has led her protagonist to his crisis de kretser pursues ideas of exile loss disappointment mortality the nature of happiness and also of evil the relation between humanity and beastliness the significance of objects both present and remembered the means by which we conjure and protect identity the shared characteristics of words and shit ideas of duty responsibility and attachment and much more
7678295 the lost dog we are told at its conclusion draws directly and obliquely on works by henry james this is a risky ploy with two obvious pitfalls the hubris involved in setting your prose in comparison with that of the master and the fact that in the reams of jamess thoughtful literary criticism there are likely to be all sorts of strictures that can be used against you
7678296 this is my favourite kind of novel it is full of incident and character tells a gripping story has many touches of brilliance and can make you laugh and wonder but it is also mightily flawed these lapses aside the language is full of light colour and precise observation and better still the author can handle ethical and political concerns with a light touch
7678297 its one of those books that hums quietly along even though extraodinary things may happen it really does feel like an everyday kind of travel it just pulls you along as the characters journey through life thats what i loved about it the writing the writing was quite lovely
7678298 considering the lyricism with which de kretser conveyed this multi generational tale it was with no regret that i renounced my antipathy for australian fiction even a sometimes awkward approach to dialogue enhanced her considered inquiry into personhood revealing conversation for its brutal dissembling self
7678299 layers of significance build and build and i was constantly in awe of michelle de kretsers style and skill the very right words in exactly the right order even that point when you might expect a book to take a bit of a yawn as it rests and gathers itself to regroup for that push to the final page well michelle de kretser just pulls out even more stops and stuns all over again the book dazzled and sparkled for me from start to finish
7678300 it is in part a commentary on the sanitised world in which we live where the old the sick and the imperfect are made to feel useless invisible we have an obsession with bodies in the west but there is a denial of bodily ness de kretser argues saying the obsession with fitness and control of appetites is unsensual our animality is something we have become disgusted by she says perfect teeth straight strong limbs and glowing skin form the template that separates the western physical orthodoxy from a more diverse cast in less affluent countries
7678301 de kretser says the praise and prizes her novels have attracted increase un confidence if that is the word when her second novel was released she was worried it wouldnt live up to the success of the first now she is uneasy that the lost dog to be published in australia the us britain and italy wont match the achievements of the hamilton case the only thing i know at the end of a novel is how to write that novel that knowledge doesnt transfer across to the next one she says soberly

7678342 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
7678343 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
7678344 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
7678345 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
7678346 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
7678347 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

7678411 the constituency consists of 69 percent malay 25 percent chinese and the remainder being indian if you look at the malay vote if he manages to woo them if he manages to pull 70 strong to 80 percent many people in umno would jump because they would see that he controls the malay support
7678412 if you jump sooner then you can hope to get a position in his new government you jump later he may not even pick you
7678413 the umno machinery has been playing up ethnic sentiments to its height they openly compare chinese as pigs
7678414 you never do that publicly never put that in a campaign and this time around umno used that in a malay area hoping that would push up the malay support to create that sense that if you have anwar winning the chinese and the indians are going to dominate the country

7678439 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7678440 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7678441 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7678442 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate
7678443 we now have the complete bow equipment quiver and arrows
7678444 and we have surprisingly a lot of organic material like leather parts of shoes and a trouser leg that we wouldnt normally find

7678460 wow that was the most fun ive ever had at a wedding your reception was absolutely beautiful every detail was perfect
7678461 obviously from a libertarian policy standpoint biden generally sucks there is no need to rehash all that here its been done elsewhere however just from a strategical point of view i think biden sucks as well this election should be a blowout if its framed as a referendum on george bush and the republicans however if it s focus shifts to the national s ecurity bona fides and experience factor of team obama then obama likely loses contrary to this laughable addle headed nonsense that purportedly passes for punditry if obama needs to rely on joe biden to reframe the terms of the debate then obama is going to be on the wrong side of extra crispy come november 5th the fact is that the second stringer on the presidential ticket is largely inconsequential in terms of actually influencing voter opinions of the first stringer one way or another reference dan quayle and lloyd benson the only significance of biden is that his selection portends a post labor day general election strategy that more or less concedes the home turf to mccain and the republicans frankly i see mr hair club for mens monday morning quarterbacking bloviations about his tripartite iraq partition plan being perfect fodder for mr pow and his iraqi surge strategy for democrats thats not the debate you want
7678462 obamas campaign slogan has gone from change we can believe in to trust me not really that much change id put the odds now at almost even in terms of who will win i still give a slight advantage to obama because of all the new registered voters that obama and clinton brought in during the democratic primaries and the fact that the gop brand is still in the toilet

7678501 the u s intelligence community buckled sooner in 2002 than previously reported to bush administration pressure for data justifying an invasion of iraq
7678502 the documents suggest that the public relations push for war came before the intelligence analysis which then conformed to public positions taken by pentagon and white house officials

7678504 a recently declassified draft of the cias october 2002 white paper on iraqi wmd programs demonstrates that that the white paper long pre dated the compilation of the national intelligence estimate on iraqi capabilities
7678505 bush administration and the tony blair government began acting in concert to build support for an invasion of iraq two to three months earlier than previously understood
7678506 a comparison of the cia draft white paper with its publicly released edition shows that all the changes made were in the nature of strengthening its charges against iraq by inserting additional alarming claims in the manner of an advocacy or public relations document
7678507 the draft and final papers show no evidence of intelligence analysis applied to the information contained
7678508 baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or cbw against the united states fearing that exposure of iraqi involvement would provide washington a stronger cause for making war
7678509 iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the u s homeland if baghdad feared an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable or possibly for revenge

7678563 many investors who failed to buy when the market fluctuated around a relatively low price level will feel that they have missed the boat when prices rise presumably such investors will jump at the chance to buy when prices drop back to the original low level

7678625 were being treated by the city of denver and the secret service like political prisoners like pariahs
7678626 were going to stay here for just a couple of minutes to state our disgust with this abomination the way the city and secret service are tearing the constitution of the united states to shreds and then we will leave

7678632 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7678633 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7678634 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7678635 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7678636 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7678637 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7678638 no no they put it on me and told me to take it off at home
7678639 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches

7678647 but the true genuine spontaneous smile is one where the mouth spreads in a relaxed way across the face and the eyes sparkle or soften depending on the context and meaning of the smile false smiles involve only the mouth
7678648 if you were to cover up the mouth of a false smile in a photograph you would see that the eyes appear to be dead and expressionless
7678649 smiling differs from person to person it is interesting to see from our survey that two politicians figure in the worst fake smile category the next question to ask is do people really trust them
7678650 it seems that we all believe the celebrity megawatt smile is much more trustworthy

7678661 was not my departure from the white lake monastery for the sake of spiritual profit yes for its sake for i did not see there the preservation of the way of life according to gods law and the traditions of the fathers but rather a life according to ones own will and human ideas and many there were who acting in such a corrupt way imagined that they were living a virtuous life
7678662 when we were living together with you in the monastery of st cyril you know how i avoided worldly ties and strove to live according to the holy scripture even though in my slothfulness i did not succeed in this at the end of my wandering i came again to the monastery built a cell near it and lived as best as i could now i have resettled far from the monastery and have found by gods grace a place according with my ideas a place little accessible to worldly people as you yourself have seen living in solitude i occupy myself with searching the spiritual writings above all i search the lords commandments and their commentaries and the apostolic traditions then the lives and instructions of the holy fathers i reflect on all this and whatever i find after reflection to be god pleasing and useful for my soul i copy out for myself in this is my life and breath as for my infirmity and sloth i place my hope in god and the most pure mother of god if there is something for me to undertake and if i find nothing about it in scripture i lay it aside for a time until i do find something i do not presume to undertake anything at all on my own will and according to my own judgement whether you live as a hermit or in coenobitic life pay heed to the holy scripture and follow in the footsteps of the fathers or be in subjection to one who is known to you as a spiritual man in word life and judgement the holy scripture is harsh only for earthly ways of thinking but rather desires to live according to his own passionate will others do not wish humbly to search the holy scripture do not wish even to hear of how one should live as if the scripture were not written for us or need not be put in all times the words of the lord will always be words as pure as refined silver the lords commandments for them are dearer than gold and precious stones sweeter than honey and the honeycomb
7678663 the monks should earn their livelihood by the labor of their own hands but should not occupy themselves with agriculture since because of its complexity it is not suited to hermits they should accept alms only in case of illness or extreme need but not any alms that might serve to give offense to anyone they should not leave the skete in church there should be no adornments made of silver even for the sacred vessels but everything should fee simple the young and healthy should wear out the body with fasting thirst and labour while to the old and weak a relaxation is permitted to a certain extent no women at all are to enter the skete
7678664 the tradition from the holy fathers on how to live
7678665 monks should live in the wilderness and earn their livelihood by handiwork
7678666 but here as it was during my lifetime so let it remain after my death let the brethren live alone each in his own cell
7678667 in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit
7678668 i will stand in judgement with you if you give my body to anyone for it was my concern in so far as it lay in my power that i should not be deemed worthy of an honor or glory of this world as it was in this life so let it be after my death and i beg all to pray for my sinful soul and i beg forgiveness of everyone and may there be forgiveness also from me may god forgive us all

7678673 the spiritual life of the true monastic tradition is the norm of our christian life and we had better be informed of it before the terrible last day when we are called to account for our lax life we shall surely be judged for not struggling on the path of salvation if we do not live like these saints then let us at last increase our far too feeble struggles for god and offer our fervent tears of repentance and our constant self reproach at falling so short of the standard of perfection which god has shown us in his wondrous saints

7678696 there was discussion about the fact that the market has become increasingly competitive and that for us to be able to continue to maintain our level of competitiveness in australia we need to work with the government on future transitional assistance programs the spokesman said
7678697 mr mulally reiterated the significant investment that ford has made in australia over the past 82 plus years including recent significant investments such as the development of the all new falcon and the fact that australia is the global engineering lead of the corporations next global light pick up truck he said
7678698 that re emphasised our commitment to australia and that it is an ongoing commitment
7678699 but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances
7678700 hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7678701 we are led by a very talented person in brendan nelson who has my full support who i believe is doing a great job and will lead us to the next federal election
7678702 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7678703 like most australian financial services companies our results for the last financial year were directly and indirectly impacted by external events he said
7678704 however underlying business performance and momentum was maintained and we are well placed to ride out any further deterioration in the market as well as take advantage of any improvement in the industry cycle
7678705 thats still a good performance in a deteriorating economic environment mr mulcahy said
7678706 were very comfortable at the moment with the underlying securities chief financial officer chris skilton said
7678707 its not to say were not watching them very closely though
7678708 certainly the majors have indicated that they would move their rates down he said
7678709 were not a price setter we usually follow so well follow appropriately
7678710 they obviously had a go at iag and they seem to have moved on from than he said
7678711 they recently bought pmi a mortgage insurer so i dont know what their strategy is with regards to acquisitions now
7678712 we wouldnt comment on market rumour but were quite confident that our business is performing strongly
7678713 based on the outlook and continuing good progress on integration the board anticipates the groups ordinary dividend for the full year to june 2009 will be maintained at 107 cents per share suncorp said
7678714 while i understand shareholders will be disappointed by the headline result management responded well to the external challenges we faced our business remains fundamentally sound and the outlook for the current financial year is positive he said in a statement
7678715 merging our banking operations makes sense in the current economic environment and market cycle mr mulcahy said
7678716 this change has been on the radar for some time and the timing is now right
7678717 creates far more problems than it will ever solve and it leaves the underlying problem untouched
7678718 i do not believe that a woman young middle aged or old just on a whim says i think ill give up my baby
7678719 no person shall be prosecuted for any crime based solely upon the act of leaving a child in the custody of an employee on duty at a hospital licensed by the state of nebraska
7678720 the law says an adult can abandon the child it doesnt even have to be a parent
7678721 hopefully the system would kick in and parents be notified that their child has been abandoned and the family could be reunited but one of our specific concerns involves the possible deprivation of the parents or one parents rights
7678722 what this society needs to do is consider the causes that might compel a woman to give up what might mean more to her than anything in her life
7678723 we need sex education we need to stop talking this abstinence nonsense based on religion and look at the reality of what these women face
7678724 she is on her way to the little country of georgia
7678725 russian aggression is now basically trying to dismember that country in many ways
7678726 we have made a lot of good connections with people along the way both people who agree and those who disagree
7678727 it has ended quite well usually when people often active duty military or veterans pull over to talk once you show people youre willing to listen and they understand that we are not attacking them personally we have had some good conversations and find there is a lot we can agree on
7678728 in the monroe county jail an older woman jailer was keeping an eye on us
7678729 she was excited that she was going to ft mccoy where they would let her carry an ak 47 and play the role of an insurgent and pay her 12 an hour there is such a powerful presence around military base that it affects peoples hopes and imaginations
7678730 bessie the kindly jailer should have an affinity for the iraqi mothers and grandmothers the refugees with sick children but no ones going to pay bessie 12 an hour to identify with them

7678734 when its streamed down to me i dont have to worry about installing it or anything i always have the latest greatest version of it
7678735 not only does it start up quickly but should anything go wrong with the application i can just re stream it
7678736 rather than run it on your own desktop youre running it on a server virtualizing the presentation layer and distributing it over the network
7678737 in the second half of the financial year there has been some significant turnaround
7678738 looking at the health of the business outside the non recurring one off items weve got the business heading in the right direction
7678739 revenues across the wireless broadband network have also increased by 106 per cent in the second half we own and operate that network and the costs are largely fixed it translates to improved gross margins which the second half from the first half of the year had gone up from 38 to 44 per cent
7678740 well be able to do some specific campaigns with our partners
7678741 for example we can help them target geographic locations that are poorly served by other broadband technologies and get them to work on localised campaigns in those areas

7678746 we spent hours hand picking every book based on what we know our teachers need to teach our kids need to read
7678747 many many hours of ordering things and hiring the first day finally coming and being able to see the children learning in the classrooms is just thrilling
7678748 m s que por decisiones del entrenador es parte de algunas ventajas que siempre debemos considerar hay que saber en que momento y en que partido es determinante salir del azteca
7678749 afortunadamente la afici n no est solamente en el df e inclusive fuera de nuestras fronteras hay mucho p blico mexicano que tambi n quiere apoyar a la selecci n obviamente que por la magnitud del azteca es un factor a favor pero tambi n se podr a contar con el en otras plazas
7678750 tengo entendido que no habr mucha diferencia pero ahorita ser a muy prematuro mencionar sobre ese tema porque el cuerpo t cnico se re ne casi diario para tener el mejor equipo posible para los siguientes juegos est claro que queremos ir al mundial y para eso debemos trabajar duro para que los jugadores est n a tope y concentrados con su equipo y posteriormente con la selecci n

7678758 es algo que tengo en el pensamiento primero con la ayuda de dios tratar de salir y hacer las cosas bien y poco a poco minuto a minuto se van dando las cosas para que siga marcando goles y poder llegar a ese objetivo
7678759 es un t cnico que me ha tenido mucha confianza que siempre me est observando y uno tiene que estar mentalizado de que cada partido te est viendo gran cantidad de gente y uno de ellos es el t cnico de la selecci n de mi pa s as que hay que tratar de darlo todo para que te tomen en cuenta

7678766 contentos porque ligamos triunfos seguidos y tenemos el deseo de redondear muy bien esta semana con los dos partidos que restan lo que se vio en el jalisco es lo queremos transmitir un futbol ofensivo y alegre en el que haya goles y esperamos seguir en esa l nea

7678768 venimos con mucha ilusi n somos un pa s muy chico que reci n est tratando de profesionalizar el futbol estamos haciendo un gran esfuerzo dentro de las posibilidades que el pa s nos da y el due o del club nos otorga somos un equipo muy humilde con muchas limitaciones pero con un coraz n y un deseo enorme de dar un espect culo y de hacer nuestro trabajo de la mejor manera
7678769 sabemos que no podemos luchar contra el profesionalismo cruz azul es una instituci n con jugadores de gran nivel y de mucho prestigio nuestro objetivo es hacer un buen trabajo como un conjunto humilde entregado en la cancha y que viene a realizar una competencia leal
7678770 venimos a aportar para que la afici n mexicana se divierta disfrute de un espect culo me he preocupado mucho por cruz azul conozco sus habilidades mis jugadores vienen empapados de c mo juega cada uno de ellos me interesa mucho el mediocampo y sus puntas jugadores exquisitos y muy buenos

7678776 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7678777 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7678778 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7678779 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7678780 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7678781 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7678782 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7678783 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7678784 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7678785 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7678786 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
7678787 talk about their life together and building a family grounded in faith and values
7678788 huh im a contributer in the foo project and you are a contributer in baz you get to be a member of the electorate and i was denied why
7678789 if those who serve you serve you well you elect them
7678790 how to buy a digital tv the national institute of senior centers a training program for its member centers called
7678791 huh im a contributer in the foo project and you are a contributer in baz you get to be a member of the electorate and i was denied why
7678792 huh im a contributer in the foo project and you are a contributer in baz you get to be a member of the electorate and i was denied why
7678793 i will now introduce myself as the salsa kings daughter
7678794 i taste tested several batches took one for the team one of them was not so good
7678795 weve had other hispanic and cultural days but this is the first day weve dedicated just to the families
7678796 the latino community is a very active growing population of the state of oregon and our job is to provide the entertainment for the whole community and thats another side of our community
7678797 im doing this because my husbands running for president of the united states
7678798 family is first for us and it will always be that way
7678799 hes a wonderful man hes a gifted man but in the end hes just a man
7678800 i want to publicly proclaim my love and adoration for my wife michelle obama
7678801 i knew then and there there was something special about this guy
7678802 for the first time in my adult lifetime im really proud of my country
7678803 this is a man who used to swim and box and run served in the military one day woke up and couldnt walk
7678804 i never knew him to be a man who could walk without the aid of crutches
7678805 my challenges are much more public but theyre the same as most women and we need to figure this out
7678806 how do we define roles for ourselves as women that are healthy and balanced and make sense
7678807 there are serious issues that have been accumulating including ethnic problems in tibet and xinjiang as well as social issues and conflicts that have been temporarily covered up by force to guarantee a successful olympics
7678808 i cannot predict whether there will be an immediate outbreak of all these problems after the olympics but there will be an outbreak if the government does not take steps to tackle the domestic problems
7678809 the pressure is building in the pressure cooker and theres no current avenue for it to be released i believe we will see many calls both inside and outside the party to put some sort of reforms on the agenda again
7678810 this has nothing to do with the legitimacy of the communist party or debates about political systems
7678811 the clintons love this country and they love the democratic party
7678812 they are going to be active parts of our campaign for the remaining 70 days
7678813 could not be more clear about their support for my candidacy
7678814 there are going to be some of senator clintons supporters who were going to have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
7678815 but if you take a look this week i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7678816 i am confident that everything will be just fine on wednesday night
7678817 ive tried not to have long discussions about short lists long lists
7678818 but ive said publicly before and i will repeat again that senator clinton would be on anybodys short list so i took her very seriously
7678819 i said as much to him three or four days ago
7678820 bill clinton is a unique figure in our politics this is the only person the only democrat who has been re elected since f d r and he is somebody who is equally adept at talking about domestic issues and foreign policy issues
7678821 it has over the last 30 years very much taken off as a significant problem especially in hospitalized individuals
7678822 huh im a contributer in the foo project and you are a contributer in baz you get to be a member of the electorate and i was denied why
7678823 huh im a contributer in the foo project and you are a contributer in baz you get to be a member of the electorate and i was denied why
7678824 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7678825 it could be that the safety benefits of driving slower are proportionately greater than the fuel economy benefits
7678826 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7678827 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7678828 huh im a contributer in the foo project and you are a contributer in baz you get to be a member of the electorate and i was denied why
7678829 construction processes back in the 1920s when the stadium was constructed are not what they are today
7678830 and just exposure to the elements has led to the steel inside steel reinforcement inside the concrete deteriorating
7678831 some would be to look at more major type of improvements it depends upon what the cost of those are
7678832 we spend a great deal of our time in our athletic section trying to place teams and kids at various locations around the town
7678833 to lose any field in any sport is particularly bad
7678834 its all about greensboro the commitment that many of our citizens made in the 20s 30s and 40s to make sure that it was there
7678835 it meant what it was supposed to mean and that was as a memorial to our veterans
7678836 except theyd be sure to hang all the wrong people
7678837 lo que hizo martin es disminuir la dignidad de la persona humana porque una vida que comienza no puede ser fruto de un alquiler
7678838 any other time on our campus whether its between class or if its during lunchtime before school and after school they may use their cell phones
7678839 i think it just makes it a little more comfortable for the students
7678840 it makes them want to come to school more it means a lot more talking to my boyfriend at college
7678841 i think if they know that theyll be able to call mom or call home at lunch or between classes if they forgot an assignment or need something than they will be less likely to take it out and text or use the phone during class time
7678842 nationals plans appear as far as anyone can tell a giant leap backwards
7678843 the government has no opposition in principle to public private partnerships its a question of who pays and at what level
7678844 the question is how much bang you get for your buck its important to strike the incentives right
7678845 wellington council housing is outdated and the units are small cold noisy and poorly configured for modern living these issues have been building for some time and had to be addressed
7678846 this has been the most significant outbreak in recent memory and the public deserves to know what may have contributed to it and what can be done to better deal with future outbreaks
7678847 we also need to know if the hospital should have been put into lockdown earlier than was actually done
7678848 as with child bullies i wonder if these anonymous commenters and correspondents would really be quite so
7678849 nationwide its too new for us to go from a slap on the wrist to the death penalty
7678850 there had to be an intermediate step and thats what weve chosen here
7678851 it was kind of like if you foul a guy under the basket you get thrown out of the game
7678852 well why was so and so able to get that grade and you werent you probably didnt study hard enough
7678853 i know that in these asnswers were supposed to be expressing our honest opinions so here it goes really i cannot say that i have become overly attached to either of our presidential candidates theres even more drama than usual and im ready for november to come and go so things will calm down a bit no matter who we decide to elect as far as vp candidates go i know this subject has been causing quite a stir with the media mccain has his decidedly democrat friend in the spotlight now and obama has seemingly decided on a male running mate excluding hillary clinton which cant be pleasing to all of her die hard supporters all i can say is that i trust both candidates to choose the running mate that they feel will be most beneficial for this nation when they decide all we can do is make the best of it and trust their judgment
7678854 in the minds of many americans there are several obvious answers for each candidate some would see mitt romney to fit john mccain others would see hillary clinton with barack obama or maybe not but i see several unknown candidates that i would feel would fit this bill to the letter im sure not many would consider biblical characters as good choices for vp but with their wisdom and apocalyptic powers they are what every president needs by their side close your eyes and imagine john mccain standing shoulder to shoulder on the white house steps with nebuchadnezzar the great king of babylon or maybe barack obama with the great shepherd and savior of the jewish people moses quite fitting if you ask me specially since obamas slogan is all about change so i suppose you could think of obama as a moses leading the american people away from utter destruction but then again maybe not with todays technology mosess obamas staff would require at a minimum windows vista a 24 inch widescreen monitor gets 32 miles to the gallon on the highway and has at least four usb ports how do you expect a man to part an ocean with a lowly staff tough gig if you ask me though im sure we would have very fruitful summers and nearly no enemies with the divine power that most if not all biblical characters carry who would want to mess with us as john mccain always says speak softly but carry a large stick well our stick would be the decedents and warriors from heaven hows that for a large stick ever wanted the plague just in your country blood water i think not but in all seriousness mccain and obama have tough choices to make mccain has the choice of a younger promising and wise vp mitt romney like himself and obama has to make the choice between a powerful woman or john edwards which alone should speak volumes the choice is yours candidates
7678855 i said to myself get in the fairway get on the green and give yourself a chance because putting is what i do best
7678856 i knew if i hit it good enough with the way i putt i knew id have a chance
7678857 its fun to show i can play that i can still make putts under pressure
7678858 sometimes there was a week or two of nothing then craziness
7678859 we are here for this community it is what has supported us and has trusted us
7678860 i have to be here to take in the horses that are starving and at the crisis level
7678861 i think she watched a lot of us grown ups not have an outlet for our grief when james died
7678862 this is a place of healing you can see it change people people will relate to a horse with a physical injury
7678863 there may be a hundred before and a hundred after
7678864 we will not rest until the prisoners are freed and the jails are empty
7678865 we salute them and we must do all that we can to liberate them
7678866 we had lost hope that my brother would be released
7678867 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7678868 we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7678869 this is something that matters a lot to the palestinians it matters a lot to the palestinian people and it is obviously a sign of goodwill
7678870 government grade is no guarantee at all i want better
7678871 do i really have such a low an opinion of government security
7678872 impediment something that interferes with progress delays action makes progress difficult
7678873 put a man on the moon and return him safely to earth before the decade is out
7678874 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7678875 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7678876 i know that we had a tough road ahead of us we knew that these guys werent going to roll over and give up that easily
7678877 so we had to be men and thats what it takes to win
7678878 being a part of the 04 team we really didnt get the opportunity to showcase our talent
7678879 we really wanted to come in and help lead this team
7678880 we knew coming in that spain was going to be a big problem
7678881 thats the first year ive gotten a blue ribbon for my brownies
7678882 it keeps her off the streets and out of trouble
7678883 i love to bake cookies but i hate to bag them
7678884 if i dont get a hug and a smile they dont get a cookie
7678885 this is the most determined group of delegates ive seen in a long time
7678886 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7678887 a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7678888 there are a lot of delegates here who had passionate choices in an extended primary season
7678889 we feel confident that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november
7678890 i am here because of the opportunities that my father had that my mother had you know we are who americans were supposed to be
7678891 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7678892 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7678893 it was just one of those things i wanted to focus on in the offseason
7678894 it helps me be a little bit lighter on my feet helps out my offensive line by improving my mobility i wanted to make sure i was good for all the snaps
7678895 there is really nothing that is negative nothing that is conclusive
7678896 we want to assure the board that nahb is staying on top of this very fluid situation
7678897 while at this time nahb has a limited ability to influence events as they are unfolding we continue to monitor the markets for any aberrations in pricing of their debt and media for any additional information that would put us in the best position to help our industry and you our members
7678898 a m me da una tos y ya dicen que tengo que hacerme ex menes lo que me pas no es grave
7678899 i think hell be a bit embarrassed to see us all but hes been the world champion for so long and now finally hes got gold
7678900 its a very exciting time and its her first olympics shes been so inspirational
7678901 o bahia n o est mal faltam apenas alguns reajustes e temos tempo de sobra para fazer isso
7678902 tenho certeza de que existe potencial para o time voltar ao g 4 vi alguns jogos e percebi que houve uma queda normal em um campeonato longo
7678903 independentemente de entrar jogando ou n o quero estar no pacaembu amanh ter a e estou ansioso por esta oportunidade
7678904 todos os jogadores quando v m jogar aqui prestam aten o j ouvem os torcedores cantando antes mesmo de entrar agora vou ter essa torcida ao meu favor e minha expectativa grande estreei fora de casa e no pacaembu diferente
7678905 l em alagoas n o fomos muito bem nessa forma o mas creio que ela v funcionar preciso trabalhar mais o morais para jogar com o douglas posso repetir essa escala o contra o gama mas n o sei se desde o in cio
7678906 its just a prejudice about mixing porn and blogging that stops me thats my fault not yours
7678907 i hv never done anytg useful during my summer break excpt for enjoying the sun and travelling around the country
7678908 quiero la verdad pero solo una verdad que no afecte a mis queridos jugadores de balonmano a por cierto te baneo
7678909 si le pusieras tanto empe o al resto de cosas como a tus hobbies llegarias muy lejos
7678910 podr as irte detr s y dejarle tu puesto a alguien que lo aproveche m s que t
7678911 joder ese de ah de la primera fila no le gusta metallica tanto como a m y los tiene en su puta cara
7678912 every one of us could stand up and recite all the reasons why we must elect barack
7678913 so let there be the no mistake about it we are united we are united for change
7678914 people like fights but thats not what im seeing here
7678915 i was elected as a hillary delegate so whatever she says
7678916 i think most women realize that republican policies are not good for women and families
7678917 they are looking for someone to protect their interests and thats clearly obama
7678918 cumplan con sus compromisos y no reconozcan la independencia de esas regiones separatistas
7678919 las fronteras y la integridad territorial de georgia se merecen el mismo respeto que las de cualquier otra naci n incluida rusia
7678920 facturalux ya era mucho m s que facturaci n as que desde ahora nuestro software erp de c digo libre se llama abanq
7678921 were going to have to beat the whole dang clinton county in one week
7678922 the town knows we can get the job done and compete at our level but that was last year we want to make our own history this year
7678923 weve got a lot of work ahead of us our numbers havent changed a whole lot but i think the confidence level is definitely better
7678924 it has the potential to undermine the economies of the internet
7678925 today sites that people dont know they visited are in a position to create a profile about where and how they browse
7678926 people should be able to choose whether or not they want to be part of that exchange of information
7678927 creates far more problems than it will ever solve and it leaves the underlying problem untouched
7678928 i do not believe that a woman young middle aged or old just on a whim says i think ill give up my baby
7678929 no person shall be prosecuted for any crime based solely upon the act of leaving a child in the custody of an employee on duty at a hospital licensed by the state of nebraska
7678930 the law says an adult can abandon the child it doesnt even have to be a parent
7678931 hopefully the system would kick in and parents be notified that their child has been abandoned and the family could be reunited but one of our specific concerns involves the possible deprivation of the parents or one parents rights
7678932 what this society needs to do is consider the causes that might compel a woman to give up what might mean more to her than anything in her life
7678933 we need sex education we need to stop talking this abstinence nonsense based on religion and look at the reality of what these women face
7678934 no one has to know that im just a paper tiger living in a condo built on bullshit and sand
7678935 well just have to wait and see what happens with that was all ferguson would say on the subject afterwards neatly batting away the question of new potential recruits before the transfer window closes on september 1
7678936 we amp squo ll just have to wait and see what happens with that amp squo amp squo was all ferguson would say on the subject afterwards neatly batting away the question of new potential recruits before the transfer window closes on september 1
7678937 it seems to be a common technique of his doesnt it cordingley said of the incidents involving the boks tight head
7678938 ive only seen the footage once during the game i couldnt really remember much when he contacted me i sort of thought well hes hit me with the head but i thought the attempt might have been legitimate
7678939 it sort of glanced off me it wasnt the full impact
7678940 id have to say its probably the most enjoyable test that ive been involved in he said
7678941 i suppose looking back i wasnt expecting to be a part of this squad and to get a start against the springboks such a proud nation at probably what is my favourite stadium to play at at kings park absa stadium it was just a real honour and wins are at a premium over here
7678942 its fine its not a problem at all he said
7678943 i have to manage it pretty well these days given my age
7678944 i do have to stay pretty warm when the guys start calling you things like tin man then it becomes a bit of an issue so its a constant reminder that i have to keep myself ready to play test football
7678945 overjoyed to be making a sacrifice for the national good
7678946 weve scored three offensive touchdowns in 10 quarters and we need to move to a situation where we have a more mobile quarterback
7678947 our conditions were uncomfortable but because were westerners we suffered absolutely nothing compared to what the tibetan people suffer
7678948 the protesters participated in tibet independence activities and that is against chinas law
7678949 the relevant countries will teach their citizens to abide and respect chinas laws
7678950 shes the best stepmom sam lola and cassandra could ever hope for seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mom unless i bat 100 percent perhaps a boy awaits us
7678951 brooke found out for sure on friday and is thrilled to death

7678954 tons of people might be contenders right down to the last week thats what people want lots of competition and unpredictable things happening
7678955 we thought wed focus on good characters and lots of things could happen its a show that makes itself in some ways
7678956 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7678957 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7678958 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7678959 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible
7678960 ive moved down to the beach with tito i love being by the beach
7678961 were trying for a baby so hopefully in the next couple of months

7678968 hay que esperar pero realmente estamos en tiempo y forma para las cuestiones administrativas
7678969 lo que hacemos ahora es tratar a todo mundo como disponible para que el t cnico pueda determinar la lista final y hasta entonces movernos para saber si es dosificado o no eso es algo que se platica internamente
7678970 s por supuesto que es una ventaja que siempre debemos considerar y juega a favor
7678971 es parte de unas ventajas que podemos tener es parte de nuestra disyuntiva el saber en qu momento y en qu partido poder salir del estadio azteca porque sabemos que hay ventajas
7678972 el estadio azteca por la magnitud es un tema a favor y suma entonces as lo tratamos de manejar las ventajas que tenemos en el distrito federal todo mundo las puede ver pero hay otras ventajas en otras plazas que tambi n pesan

7678975 declara la invalidez de la porci n normativa del primer p rrafo del art culo 144 del c digo penal para el distrito federal que se ala
7678976 saben los representantes del r gimen que nosotros contamos con una tica distinta a la de ellos jam s hemos actuado sin que sea una justa respuesta por lo que m s adecuado ser a que no se siga actuando como lo est n haciendo en contra de los ciudadanos y sobre todo con los luchadores sociales
7678977 que el gobierno del ileg timo felipe calder n hinojosa los presente de inmediato e informe a los medios de comunicaci n a las organizaciones no gubernamentales de derechos humanos a las organizaciones sociales y pol ticas de oposici n y al pueblo en general el estado f sico y ps quico en que est n y el lugar en donde se encuentran detenidos nuestros militantes
7678978 jam s ha sido f cil enfrentar una detenci n de compa eros para la familia y amigos menos para la estructura a la que pertenec an los detenidos por lo que el comit del valle de m xico conciente de lo que esto significa se pone a la disposici n de la direcci n de nuestro partido para realizar las actividades que determinen
7678979 estos son los rostros de nuestros compa eros raymundo rivera bravo y edmundo reyes amaya detenidos desaparecidos por las fuerzas represivas del estado mexicano el 25 de mayo del a o en curso cuyo secuestro e ilegal detenci n sigue siendo negada por las distintas autoridades de los diferentes niveles el r gimen encabezado por el ileg timo felipe calder n est develando su verdadero rostro el rostro del fascismo
7678980 desde la frontera norte hasta la frontera sur de nuestra patria encontramos ejemplos lamentables como estos no s lo en las d cadas mencionadas sino en los m s recientes per odos de gobierno incluyendo el de fox y ahora el de felipe calder n sin que hasta ahora los pasados y actuales gobernantes primero del pri y ahora del pan se hayan preocupado por esclarecer presentar y liberar a los cientos de desaparecidos por razones pol ticas cu ntos delincuentes organizados son protegidos por los representantes del poder estatal o federal en turno es por esto que nuestro comit estatal se une a la demanda y exigencia de presentaci n con vida de nuestros compa eros y de todos los presos y desaparecidos pol ticos que se encuentran en alg n centro de reclusi n y de tortura clandestino de los que el estado niega tener y que todos los luchadores sociales sabemos existen en todo el territorio nacional igualmente exhortamos a todo el explotado y oprimido a continuar con la organizaci n difusi n y defensa de las demandas m s sentidas de nuestro pueblo
7678981 cu ntos a os han pasado y cu ntos pasar n esto ltimo no lo sabemos lo que s sabemos es que por muchos a os que pasen a nuestros seres queridos no los olvidaremos jam s nuestros desaparecidos asesinados y presos desde la ya para unos lejana d cada de los 70 para nosotros parece que fue ayer es por eso que ahora que dos m s de nuestros compa eros de lucha se encuentran desaparecidos sentimos c mo nuestros corazones se estremecen al recordar aquella d cada y su guerra sucia nuestro pueblo de guerrero se une a la condena de la desaparici n forzada de los luchadores sociales en el territorio nacional por lo que exigimos al gobierno de ulises ruiz gobernador repudiado por el pueblo de oaxaca y al usurpador de la presidencia de la rep blica mexicana felipe calder n hinojosa presenten de manera inmediata a todos los luchadores sociales que se encuentran en las c rceles clandestinas y cuarteles militares
7678982 ante la detenci n de nuestros militantes en oaxaca informamos al comit central que las estructuras del partido y ej rcito en nuestro estado nos encontramos agrupados como la circunstancia lo amerita y cada uno de los militantes y combatientes con la disposici n a recibir rdenes para actuar como se nos indique por lo que solicitamos a nuestras m ximas instancias de partido y ej rcito que determinen ya como proceder
7678983 informamos a nuestro pueblo al bur pol tico y al comit central que dadas las circunstancias se ha hecho el recuento de fuerzas y cada compa ero y estructura se encuentra ocupando su lugar correspondiente conscientes de que este momento demanda una estricta disciplina como producto de las convicciones revolucionarias nos reportamos en completa disposici n a las rdenes que dispongan la comandancia general y el comit central dispuestos a asumir los retos que demande la presente etapa de lucha a nuestro pueblo le preguntamos qu hacer ante la euforia de ultraderecha ante la ofensiva policiaco militar resistencia organizada combinando todas las formas de lucha o resignaci n poniendo la otra mejilla
7678984 el comit estatal del pdpr epr del estado de chiapas manifiesta que con el pretexto del combate a la delincuencia organizada y narcotr fico el gobierno de la ultraderecha representada por felipe calder n hinojosa intenta contener toda manifestaci n de oposici n a su r gimen mediante acciones fascistas asesoradas por las diferentes estructuras de inteligencia extranjeras representadas por los gobiernos m s sanguinarios de este siglo entre ellos el norteamericano el espa ol y el israel demandamos enf ticamente del comit central y bur pol tico que tome en sus manos directamente el caso de oaxaca y que determinen las decisiones correspondientes porque la militancia como dice la consigna estamos presentes y resueltos a vencer consideramos que el deber de todo militante de todo revolucionario es identificarnos en la acci n como producto de las convicciones ideol gicas son tiempo de unidad tanto en el terreno revolucionario como en la lucha popular
7678985 informamos a nuestro comit central que una vez m s cumpliremos cualquier tarea que nos demande sin importar que este gobierno para castigarnos impunemente nos llame criminales o terroristas de manera infame sin que lo seamos para justificar el terrorismo de estado que prevalece en nuestro pa s
7678986 los compa eros aprehendidos que siguen siendo torturados fueron a causa de un se alamiento aclaramos la fuerza est en la prudencia todo lo hemos resuelto privilegiando soluciones pol ticas pero tambi n el pueblo nos ha dado el derecho de la autodefensa por lo tanto podr amos cambiar de t ctica y si en esta t ctica de autodefensa la hacemos como tales agotando la soluci n pol tica y dando otro paso
7678987 hemos recibido de todos nuestros comit s estatales y regionales la disposici n de recibir rdenes por lo que se ordena a todo militante y combatiente a concentrarse a sus unidades correspondientes y mantenerse en alerta general quien no lo haga ser tomado como un desertor
7678988 por el trato que la mayor a de los medios impresos y electr nicos est n dando a nuestros comunicados existe la seguridad de que nuevamente la censura y la autocensura se aplique por comisi n omisi n o convicci n sin embargo por tica profesional no deber an detenerse en cumplir su importante labor de difundir nuestra postura ante los acontecimientos del pa s y mucho menos cuando est en juego la vida de dos luchadores sociales sin importar la forma de lucha de la cual son part cipes pero tambi n se ha contado con la solidaridad de gente honesta y con un alto valor civil para quienes se gu an en los marcos del periodismo mercantil preguntamos qu necesitamos hacer para ser considerados noticia o ser necesario que aparezcan los cuerpos de nuestros compa eros para que esto sea primicia
7678989 la presencia de los operativos militares desplegados en gran parte de nuestra rep blica no han servido para nada en la lucha contra la delincuencia organizada por el contrario se ha agudizado m s la disputa interna de los grupos de poder en los lugares donde ellos operan vinculados con los grupos del crimen organizado agradecemos la solidaridad desinteresada de todas aquellas organizaciones y personas nacionales e internacionales quienes a pesar de los riesgos y consecuencias que traigan estos pronunciamientos a favor de nuestros compa eros desaparecidos se han manifestado si el actual estado de derecho el estado de derecho olig rquico en lugar de castigar a los responsables de la represi n de las masacres de los cr menes de lesa humanidad proporciona a estos chacales protecci n e impunidad tengan por seguro que sin fecha y hora fija nuestro pueblo ejercer su leg timo derecho de hacerse justicia
7678990 resulta insultante para la inteligencia del pueblo que las autoridades estatales de oaxaca y federales pretendan eludir su responsabilidad en la detenci n desaparici n de nuestros compa eros con el c nico tr mite de
7678991 ante la actitud hip crita y fascista de este gobierno ileg timo de profundizar la guerra sucia y el terrorismo de estado como su principal pol tica contra los luchadores sociales los ponentes pol ticos y los revolucionarios ante la creciente escalada de represi n contra nuestro pueblo los luchadores sociales y activistas defensores de los derechos humanos ante la existencia de presos pol ticos y de conciencia del pa s condenados a penas y tratos inhumanos en c rceles de exterminio ante la pr ctica fascista de la desaparici n forzada de luchadores sociales ante la pretensi n del gobierno calderonista de mantener en calidad de detenidos desaparecidos a nuestros camaradas edmundo reyes amaya y gabriel alberto cruz s nchez

7678993 the single largest mobile marketing event in the u s to date
7678994 patients with active myeloma require effective treatment to improve their chances of survival the impact of waiting even a month for treatment can result in a life or death situation
7678995 until this date the usual regulations apply the provision of funding for treatments currently undergoing nice appraisal is a matter for local pcts and nice has no role in those local decisions
7678996 under the new system no low skilled migrants will be allowed into the uk from outside the eu that is a large amount of people who are being written off but who add a huge amount to the diversity of an area and local economy
7678997 were also worried that the system is based on a short term economic analysis of what migrants bring to a country a migrant may be entrepreneurial once they have arrived in this country ie they create a skill we just dont know
7678998 migrant labour is by no means the only solution to our tight labour market the national skills strategy was launched to address the needs of our domestic labour force
7678999 the number of arrests is up on last year but that is predominantly because of proactive policing
7679000 the message is that there is no place for knives at the carnival
7679001 we share the concern of londoners over the recent spate of knife crime and we are doing all we can to combat that
7679002 all christians have an important role to play in developing their own environmental awareness and encouraging it in others this will prove invaluable for those looking to find a deeper theological understanding of our christian concern for creation
7679003 this book offers us not just tips on energy saving but a reorientation
7679004 the intention is not to urge christians to get measured for a hair shirt but to rediscover how good and joyful a thing it is to dwell together in unity with everything else that lives
7679005 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is the british government in london
7679006 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7679007 such language as has been used by this sinn f in representative begins to cast significant doubt on sinn f ins commitment to making progress in stormont
7679008 there are no words to describe it really the whole road loves them
7679009 the children usually come down here about 10 30am and spend all day every day with us at 4pm they usually go home when they went home yesterday they were playing with their dad in the garden
7679010 he was target practising with the gun and then somebody rang his mobile the gun was ready to fire and he answered the phone
7679011 rashids sister is really active and she got hold of the gun and pointed it at her brother he was on the high ground and she was on the low ground it hit him right in the middle of the back of his head everybodys in shock
7679012 we were called to an address in washwood heath in birmingham at around 6 40pm last night following reports of a child having been shot he had suffered a serious head injury
7679013 we sent an ambulance two rapid response vehicles an incident support officer and west midlands care team emergency doctors to take the child to birmingham childrens hospital
7679014 while we are still trying to establish precisely what happened this does appear to be a tragic accident involving young children
7679015 officers are not seeking anyone else in connection with the incident
7679016 yesterday afternoon i saw the man next door doing target practice against some kind of shooting board in his back garden with an air rifle i asked him if he was with a club and he said he was
7679017 i have to admit i wasnt very happy at this going on next door to me because it made a loud clacking noise and i dont like having guns so nearby
7679018 its been crazy for the last few days im just looking forward to sleeping in my own bed im certainly going to continue on to london in 2012 i want to focus on my sport its going to be exciting its going to be fun and i just need to get the balance right to make sure theres enough commitment to my sport anything else goes in around that
7679019 we were just sitting back chilling sipping the champers it was wicked
7679020 no one expected this level of reception but today the focus should be on the athletes for me its been a huge privilege to lead such a close knit motivated and successful team i hope that many of these athletes will be with us at the greatest moment in british sport when we host the games in london in 2012
7679021 its a historic day the best results for team gb for 100 years the whole team is very grateful to the british public who have been absolutely magnificent in their enthusiasm and commitment in supporting the team
7679022 obviously i had my expectations but it wasnt two gold medals at all its been fantastic
7679023 i just hope shes not overwhelmed by it all but i dont think she will be for one second i think shell just enjoy it
7679024 shes so focused so dedicated but more importantly she loves what she does i think shell get back in the pool as soon as she can
7679025 in america they know me as the guy who did faith
7679026 last year this was a financial crisis that we thought with a bit of luck would be over by christmas but it has dragged on for a year and looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7679027 it is fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7679028 some people have said it is as big a financial shock as the great depression and as far as the oil shock goes the rise in oil prices is in the same order of magnitude that we had to deal with in the 1970s
7679029 there are periods when markets look like they are getting better then another grenade explodes another bout of fear of sustainability of some financial institutions maybe intervention by the authorities
7679030 it has been very much ebb and flow and the mood here is very much one of financial caution as regards next year we have our fingers crossed but there is the recognition there is still quite a long way to go yet
7679031 on the assumption commodity prices remain stable and if anything fall back then inflation should drop back as we go through next year
7679032 one would hope that the conditions in credit markets should gradually start to improve and those two factors will help to ensure growth will start to pick up as we go through next year
7679033 its a sad indictment of our broken society that so many are turning to things like drug and alcohol abuse at such a young age
7679034 this study shows a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7679035 it is important to stress that the reason for this is still not understood although it is possible that the caesarean section itself is responsible
7679036 the worst thing you can be in this industry is a middle class white male
7679037 for the third year in a row we have sold in excess of 1 5m tickets
7679038 that is a terrific achievement against a backdrop of the global economic situation an incredibly wet august competition from a fantastic olympic games and of course the problems with the box office system
7679039 i think the box office effect has been the major issue at this years festival i think it has caused a great deal of upset with the public and it has impacted on a proportion of the audience who will have been put off
7679040 i think weve lost the confidence of the public through ticketing and i think it will take a long time to build it up again
7679041 i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
7679042 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7679043 this years event was enjoyed by more than a million people as the sights and sounds of the caribbean and other cultures came alive on the streets
7679044 i love the music and the dancing and im definitely going to come again next year
7679045 i think its extremely important just to keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7679046 obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here
7679047 we decided that time is against us that time is against the moderates and that stagnation is not an option for the israeli government
7679048 this is something that matters a lot to the palestinians
7679049 sung kim last week had very detailed and substantive discussions with his north korean counterpart and on the subject of verification
7679050 what i would say to you is that i would not make too much out of this meeting that took place
7679051 wants to see this verification package as soon as possible so that we can move forward with this delisting
7679052 i told you she was good sure hope e remembers us little folks when she makes it big time
7679053 i enjoyed reading e today very well written if your mother does say so herself and just the right touch of humor
7679054 our simple message to those mps considering their options is dont rush as a nation we have more to lose than to gain by getting this wrong
7679055 ich habe immer noch ein lautes pfeifen im rechten ohr und sp re einen extremen druck bei den gleichgewichtstests die die rzte mit mir durchgef hrt haben bin ich immer wieder nach rechts gekippt falls sich das nicht ndert kann ich nicht mehr fu ball spielen die n chsten 14 tage stehe ich weiter unter beobachtung
7679056 in sterreich sind bengalische feuer in den stadien erlaubt nach unserem 1 0 hat ein austria fan einen knallk rper geworfen der ber meinen kopf flog ich dachte dass es ein bengalisches feuer w re danach kann ich mich nur noch an den knall erinnern
7679057 ich habe mich immer gefragt warum petrik sander so leidet jetzt wei ich welche h lle er durchgemacht hat
7679058 das pfeifen habe ich immer noch im ohr und es wird wohl auch nicht weggehen
7679059 at the valleys foot circled by peaks of ruptured stone
7679060 apart from the odd poem or mixed media work i was sufficiently enlightened by this publication
7679061 difficulty and so on that issue if it ever was one in literature in the 20th 21st centuries really died in the 60s or earlier

7679063 el municipio no puede dejar inconcluso el by pass de la avenida venezuela
7679064 nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing
7679065 i think youre setting your sights very high and that maybe you should consider this
7679066 the bottom line is that this critically endangered species needs our help
7679067 what we have seen over and over again where economics and partisanship and political interests bump up against the science science loses
7679068 where the science is the weakest and the economic impact is the greatest
7679069 this is a good time to get a little more education
7679070 we have a fine young ministerial student in our congregation
7679071 and hell be going off to seminary this fall i wondered if you would be interested in helping him financially
7679072 i certainly would pastor and let me tell you why
7679073 and i came to regret it that young minister went on to become one of the finest servants of the lord anywhere and just think i could have had a part in his ministry but missed that opportunity
7679074 i promised the lord if another such opportunity came my way i would not let this slip through my fingers i would jump at the chance
7679075 vi har jo willumsens museum i frederikssund s der g r vi tit op men jeg m rligt indr mme selve kunsten siger mig ikke noget intet
7679076 men jeg beundrer dem der kan lave s dan nogle forf rdelige skulpturer og f penge for det
7679077 jeg har st et og stirret p tre streger p et maleri hvor jeg t nkte hvad pokker er meningen men jeg g r det jo alligevel jeg g r troligt ind og glor p det for jeg synes det er s fascinerende at de kan f udstillet s dan noget skrammel det fascinerer mig at nogen kan f noget ud af det som jeg ikke fatter en brik af
7679078 da vi n ede ned til den afdeling hvor der er malerier med dyr og krig som forestiller noget blev jeg imponeret
7679079 it has been brought to our attention that there were some images of the band that were banned from myspace because we are an all ages family friendly venue we pride ourselves on providing a positive atmosphere for the kids that come in to see shows unfortunately because of those images and the lyrics to the songs we have found there is no way you guys will be able to meet those guidelines
7679080 everyones been getting word that were crazy and our fans are even crazier
7679081 were pros were not out to kill anyone there are some promoters who have refused to book us because of the type of music we play and how crazy we can make our fans
7679082 it was a very nice christian venue so with the content of those banned photos i could see why they initially had a problem with us it was because of our fans though that they were willing to listen to us and we ended up playing the show after all
7679083 maybe its time to start living up to peoples expectations and become a truly deadly band
7679084 if people think that were going to go out and chop up some girls like pieces of meat like in those pictures maybe we should just start murdering people on stage thatll show em
7679085 now that gives us a chance to snag up a couple piles of bags containing 500 item codes yee hah

7679087 we continue to have great market response to our pharmacy benefit offering and need to support this business success with additional capacity
7679088 this is a significant victory for our community and were very happy about the decision
7679089 we need something that protects us from the ups and downs of the market
7679090 short sales and foreclosures account for approximately one third of transactions
7679091 political issue but as a matter of accuracy and justice
7679092 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7679093 this release improves almost every aspect of adium ranging from performance and memory to facebook chat support and from user interface polish to much improved msn support with personal messages
7679094 happiness does not depend on outward things but on the way we see them
7679095 while these versions did protect against the vulnerabilities discussed in the bulletin they lacked other important security and reliability updates
7679096 this only affected the packages on the microsoft download center microsoft update and office update contained and were distributing the correct versions of the binaries and did not need to be updated
7679097 if you choose to not reinstall the update you must manually set the registry key in order to block powerpoint file types as a workaround
7679098 the application was checking for the os version in a registry value specifically hklm software wow6432node microsoft windows nt currentversion csdversion on the x64 version of windows vista service pack 1 however this value does not exist the correct value does show up under hkey local machine software microsoft windows nt currentversion csdversion however this highlights an inherent problem with relying on the registry method to capture this information as operating systems evolve there is no guarantee that registry information will persist between operating systems or in some cases there may be changes between service packs for the same operating system
7679099 windows vista is still very much relevant today there is still very much to say in regards to windows vista and lots more experiences to blog about surrounding windows vista and windows live our blogs here wont be going away we continue to add value to windows vista with releases such as windows search 4 0 and coming soon the beta 2 release of internet explorer 8 you can also expect us to take part in the ongoing discussion taking place from the engineering windows 7 blog on building the next version of windows as well

7679107 it is upon the muslim faithful to free their prisoners and to pay their ransom
7679108 there is no muslim who forsakes a muslim in a situation where his reputation and honor are violated except that allah will forsake him in a situation where he would want his help and there is no muslim who helps a muslim in a situation where his reputation and honor are being violated except that allah will help him in a situation where he would want his help
7679109 whoever helps his brother in secret allah will help him in this world and the next
7679110 the believer to the rest of the believers is like the head to the body the believer is pained at what afflicts the rest of the believers just as the head feels the pain of whatever afflicts the body
7679111 the believers are like a single person if the head hurts the entire body complains and if his eyes hurt the entire body complains
7679112 you see the believers in their mercy and compassion towards each other like a single body if a single limb hurts the rest of the body tends to it to relieve it
7679113 whoever relieves a muslim of a hardship in this life allah will relieve him of a hardship in the hereafter and allah will help his slave so much as he helps his brother
7679114 the muslim is the brother of the muslim he does not oppress him or hand him over and whoever helps his brother allah will help him and whoever relieves the distress of a muslim allah will relieve his distress on the day of resurrection
7679115 rather than prematurely writing off the idea its important to critically study municipal networks successes and shortcomings

7679120 none of the guys ive dated and had sex with ever said anything to me about shaving off my pubes
7679121 creates far more problems than it will ever solve and it leaves the underlying problem untouched
7679122 i do not believe that a woman young middle aged or old just on a whim says i think ill give up my baby
7679123 no person shall be prosecuted for any crime based solely upon the act of leaving a child in the custody of an employee on duty at a hospital licensed by the state of nebraska
7679124 the law says an adult can abandon the child it doesnt even have to be a parent
7679125 hopefully the system would kick in and parents be notified that their child has been abandoned and the family could be reunited but one of our specific concerns involves the possible deprivation of the parents or one parents rights
7679126 what this society needs to do is consider the causes that might compel a woman to give up what might mean more to her than anything in her life
7679127 we need sex education we need to stop talking this abstinence nonsense based on religion and look at the reality of what these women face
7679128 creates far more problems than it will ever solve and it leaves the underlying problem untouched
7679129 you can probably tell that im not the shy type i like the way i look and i like being looked at
7679130 i decided that i wanted to be in a magazine and i went into the sex shop and bought some mags to see which would be a best for me to send my pictures to it wasnt till i had decided on newcummers that i even told my guy what i wanted to do he got all possessive about his woman being on display for strangers to see and jack over but he changed his mind when i said hed get to take the photos i think he did a pretty good job of it ive laid around naked in the sun a few times but ive never gotten sexed up outdoors before

7679134 global trading conditions for wine continue to be competitive but the category remains in solid growth mr johnston said
7679135 we have not been immune from industry wide pressures including an economic slow down in key markets and higher grape prices
7679136 foreign exchange movements in the 12 months to 30 june 2008 cut wine earnings by approximately 70 million and wine growth by 14 6 percentage points
7679137 put simply financial returns from wine have not met our expectations
7679138 we are making good progress with our wine review but wont be commenting on our analysis or conclusions until the review is completed
7679139 the impairment charges reflect revised growth expectations and the impact of exchange rate movements on the australian wine business the company said
7679140 the charges include write downs to intangibles inventory agriculture assets and property plant and equipment
7679141 the write down to bulk wine in australia and california adjusts the carrying value of inventory to net realisable value
7679142 continues with a rigorous process reporting directly to the chairman
7679143 the scope of the review is comprehensive and will amongst other things consider the optimal structure and operations of fosters wine business
7679144 fosters continues to expect the review to be completed by the end of 2008
7679145 in light of the wine review fosters will not be providing any specific earnings guidance for fiscal 2009
7679146 but weve got a leader and i think hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances
7679147 hes doing a good job under difficult circumstances and the last thing we want to do is develop a tradition of knifing our leaders
7679148 we are led by a very talented person in brendan nelson who has my full support who i believe is doing a great job and will lead us to the next federal election
7679149 i took him at his word at that and my presumption is that he will indeed be leaving politics
7679150 but he will make his position clear i suspect in the next two or three weeks
7679151 like most australian financial services companies our results for the last financial year were directly and indirectly impacted by external events he said
7679152 however underlying business performance and momentum was maintained and we are well placed to ride out any further deterioration in the market as well as take advantage of any improvement in the industry cycle
7679153 thats still a good performance in a deteriorating economic environment mr mulcahy said
7679154 were very comfortable at the moment with the underlying securities chief financial officer chris skilton said
7679155 its not to say were not watching them very closely though
7679156 certainly the majors have indicated that they would move their rates down he said
7679157 were not a price setter we usually follow so well follow appropriately
7679158 they obviously had a go at iag and they seem to have moved on from than he said
7679159 they recently bought pmi a mortgage insurer so i dont know what their strategy is with regards to acquisitions now
7679160 we wouldnt comment on market rumour but were quite confident that our business is performing strongly
7679161 based on the outlook and continuing good progress on integration the board anticipates the groups ordinary dividend for the full year to june 2009 will be maintained at 107 cents per share suncorp said
7679162 while i understand shareholders will be disappointed by the headline result management responded well to the external challenges we faced our business remains fundamentally sound and the outlook for the current financial year is positive he said in a statement
7679163 merging our banking operations makes sense in the current economic environment and market cycle mr mulcahy said
7679164 this change has been on the radar for some time and the timing is now right
7679165 the promina merger is well advanced and we have the merger team expertise and infrastructure in place to help drive this change
7679166 creates far more problems than it will ever solve and it leaves the underlying problem untouched
7679167 i do not believe that a woman young middle aged or old just on a whim says i think ill give up my baby
7679168 no person shall be prosecuted for any crime based solely upon the act of leaving a child in the custody of an employee on duty at a hospital licensed by the state of nebraska
7679169 the law says an adult can abandon the child it doesnt even have to be a parent
7679170 hopefully the system would kick in and parents be notified that their child has been abandoned and the family could be reunited but one of our specific concerns involves the possible deprivation of the parents or one parents rights
7679171 what this society needs to do is consider the causes that might compel a woman to give up what might mean more to her than anything in her life
7679172 we need sex education we need to stop talking this abstinence nonsense based on religion and look at the reality of what these women face
7679173 creates far more problems than it will ever solve and it leaves the underlying problem untouched
7679174 there was discussion about the fact that the market has become increasingly competitive and that for us to be able to continue to maintain our level of competitiveness in australia we need to work with the government on future transitional assistance programs the spokesman said
7679175 mr mulally reiterated the significant investment that ford has made in australia over the past 82 plus years including recent significant investments such as the development of the all new falcon and the fact that australia is the global engineering lead of the corporations next global light pick up truck he said
7679176 that re emphasised our commitment to australia and that it is an ongoing commitment

7679180 we are real good at seeing other people but when they see us we think they are talking about somebody else
7679181 we just want you to succeed in a way that scales time and time again it feels like you are trying to threaten us into something that is never exactly clear
7679182 considering the fact that we are the only network that provides any real products to your customers on the ning
7679183 use of ning is a privilege not a right we do not intend to debate our decision

7679185 if such and such is art and such and such is art then art must mean anything created by humans which is emotionally evocative
7679186 art must mean a painting or a song or a book or a movie
7679187 i think people are concerned certainly theres about 20 000 children not enrolled in school and if children are not in the system theyve got no chance in life
7679188 there was a very good discussion a lot of points put on the table which the ministers took on board and i guess that will formulate the basis of further discussion to caucus
7679189 knowing her nose better than anyone else i was in a unique position to take care of the problem

7679193 to many this might seem weird but they challenge us that its actually much weirder to give our babies cows milk than it is to drink milk from another woman
7679194 that bond was really emotionally important to me i would never have been able to let someone else breast feed her in a million years
7679195 we believe we will have more than sufficient cash on hand at the closing to manage the integration process and run the day to day business

7679202 kebetulan saya lahir dan melewatkan masa kecil di cilacap tahun 1990 1994 saya juga terlibat dalam pengorganisasian buruh perkebunan dan petani daerah itu sehingga saya relatif tidak kesulitan masuk ke cilacap dan banyumas dan memperjuangkan aspirasi warga kedua daerah itu jika kelak akhirnya dapat duduk di dpr
7679203 saya masuk politik praktis dalam hal ini parpol karena untuk menciptakan perubahan yang nyata dibutuhkan kekuatan politik jika dahulu saya berjuang lewat demonstrasi sekarang semoga dapat melalui dpr
7679204 salah satu rekomendasi pertemuan nasional pena 98 pada juni 2007 adalah berusaha masuk ke ruang politik legal untuk memastikan ada perubahan seperti yang diharapkan sebab setelah direfleksikan gerakan kami selama ini punya satu kekurangan yaitu kami tidak punya kemampuan untuk melaksanakan kebijakan kami mencoba mengatasi masalah itu dengan masuk ke parlemen
7679205 dalam politik tidak ada kawan atau lawan abadi selain itu keterlibatan mereka dalam kasus itu sudah selesai secara hukum
7679206 mereka yang mengaku reformis sekarang sikapnya juga banyak yang sama dengan orde baru keras kepala dan otoriter jadi akhirnya semua tergantung orangnya dengan komitmennya

7679208 join forces for an unconventional look at the news of the day
7679209 its a complete exaggeration to suggest that if we oppose these four particular tax measures we will be picking apart the governments surplus
7679210 if we were to oppose these particular measures they amount to about 1 5 billion of revenue a year thats about 0 5 per cent of total government revenue
7679211 it would mean that this year there would be a surplus of 20 billion instead of 21 5 billion
7679212 what the government is actually doing is taxing australians now in an unjustifiable way in order to spend it later to buy their way back into office in 2010

7679231 mr cummings said he points them to statistics on lingering racial disparities in education health and income i hope that progressive minded people will not make a blanket conclusion that if barack has made it everybody can make it he said
7679232 heaven forbid that such a toxic message of hope and change should reach the masses
7679233 virginity by being once lost may be ten times found by being ever kept it is ever lost to speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible disobedience virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate offendress against nature virginity breeds mites much like a cheese consumes itself to the very paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of self love which is the most inhibited sin in the canon keep it not you cannot choose but lose byt

7679235 collage assembling contemporary art is the first authoritative survey of the history of collage from its origins through to the latest work being produced by artists today collage has a relatively short but incredibly rich history dating back to the early 1900s it first emerged in the work of artists such as picasso braque and later the constructivists and has since proliferated through figures like kurt schwitters max ernst and the surrealists branching out into a myriad of fine art practice that encompasses assemblage montage and d collage the popularity of collage is on the increase again partly as a result of such postmodernist concerns as pluralism multiplicity and hybridity this art form is also flourishing in other areas ranging from the traditional cut and paste method through to digital and installation collage featuring works by international artists picasso schwitters and ernst through to hannah hoch martha rosler john stezaker richard hamilton layla curtis david salle eduardo poalozzi javier rodriguez robert rauschenberg mimei thompson david thorpe fred tomaselli and many more collage assembling contemporary art also includes texts by both academics and artists which outline the history of the medium as well as critically addressing how collage is being used throughout contemporary art today

7679239 barack y yo nos criamos con muchos de los mismos valores por los que vosotros trabaj is duro y quer is en la vida
7679240 despu s de todo lo que ha ocurrido en los ltimos 19 meses el barack obama que conozco hoy es el mismo hombre del que me enamor hace 19 a os
7679241 to give the party momentum going into the general election so that come november barack obama will become the president of the united states
7679242 now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment
7679243 im here to tell you my name is hillary clinton and i do not support this message
7679244 if he wants to win the election he needs to get the vast majority of hillary supporters her strongest support is where hes weakest white working class men and women
7679245 they have to make those voters comfortable with barack obama have to make them think hes part of the american dream
7679246 there is no stronger surrogate for sen obama among senator clintons supporters than senator clinton
7679247 so we are confident as we come through this convention that our party will come together it might take a little time for some people to come around but we cant let the few voices distort the vast majority of her supporters that i do believe support senator obama
7679248 many are coming our way it will take a little longer
7679249 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
7679250 yes but we dont sell them do you need a bible

7679284 i want to finish off the desire i have to play one day cricket without being selfish because its important the team has plenty of time to prepare for the next world cup
7679285 thats still a long way off but i wont be ruthless about trying to push on i dont want to hang on too long
7679286 in the short term its disappointing but in the longer term its really good because it gives me extra time to get right for india

7679322 like most australian financial services companies our results for the last financial year were directly and indirectly impacted by external events he said

7679333 while i understand shareholders will be disappointed by the headline result management responded well to the external challenges we faced our business remains fundamentally sound and the outlook for the current financial year is positive he said in a statement
7679334 merging our banking operations makes sense in the current economic environment and market cycle mr mulcahy said

7679351 i do not believe that a woman young middle aged or old just on a whim says i think ill give up my baby
7679352 no person shall be prosecuted for any crime based solely upon the act of leaving a child in the custody of an employee on duty at a hospital licensed by the state of nebraska

7679605 youve been thinking that your old man is a delusional fool youve been thinking hes gone senile and hes hearing voices in his head and ive been thinking about what youve been thinking and ive been thinking you may be right
7679606 shit maybe youre just as dumb as your brothers after all
7679607 look i think its obvious that we dont have the skills necessary to build the boat or collect the animals
7679608 and with the flood coming in a couple of months we dont have time to learn but there are people who already possess those skills forty miles from here is the port city theres a whole ship building industry there thousands of laborers who know how to build ships and shipwrights who know how to organize and supervise those laborers
7679609 and there are hunters and trappers who know how to catch animals and there are people who work for circuses and zoos who know how to capture any kind of animal and keep it alive
7679610 i know all of this shem but none of these people are going to work for us for free and were not rich in fact about the only thing of value we own is the land were sitting on and frankly it isnt worth all that much
7679611 so you could probably get a sizable loan using the farm as collateral and if you were willing to pay a high interest rate you could probably get a loan for two or three times the value of our land
7679612 then we could contract people to get the job done and we could tell them well pay them half up front and half when the job is done
7679613 wed never make enough extra money to pay back a loan especially at high interest theyd take our land and throw us all in debtors prison
7679614 im sorry shem but this is a dumb idea its totally unrealistic
7679615 father listen to me we get the loan from the bank we use it to pay our work force half up front the first payment on the loan isnt due for at least a month after they disburse the funds right if we dont make the payment on time they send us late notices then they send somebody out to talk to us we ask for a little more time they threaten us eventually were thirty days late on our first payment and it gets serious they declare us in default they demand we relinquish possession of the farm the local authorities give us thirty days to vacate how much time has passed by now three four months
7679616 and three or four months from now where is our farm where is the bank where are the local authorities where are all the laborers shipwrights and animal trappers where is everybody we owe money to
7679617 as a result ea does not intend to make any further announcements regarding the status of any discussions or negotiations with take two unless and until discussions between ea and take two have been terminated or such parties have entered into a transaction
7679618 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7679619 we are perturbed at the lack of interest by city management in cleaning up vacant buildings
7679620 to tell you the truth i had no idea how it is supposed to be spelled
7679621 but each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey i come here tonight as a sister blessed with a brother who is my mentor my protector and my lifelong friend i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion and her intelligence reflected in my own daughters
7679622 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7679623 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7679624 merv is a fine example of someone who has contributed strongly to his community
7679625 whats more he has lost none of his passion and enthusiasm for local history and his current research promises to reveal more gems about the past in the inverell district
7679626 workers are going to be enthusiastically supporting barack obama for president
7679627 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7679628 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no
7679629 what the barack obama campaign needs to do is tell his story

7679642 i think it is really important for local kids to get their views and opinions out there on a larger scale we picked cameron because we believed he could really make an impression down in canberra and get the local angle across
7679643 i am really looking forward to finding out what other people think about a range of scientific issues especially medical uses for science

7679690 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7679691 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7679692 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7679693 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7679694 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7679723 with this new data the predicted fastest 100 meter time would probably go down a little bit
7679724 the record then was about 9 79 and the model predicted these crazy times that by 2009 itd be down in the high 9 6s
7679725 i thought thats crazy its not going to progress that fast every day that i think about that i kick myself thats my penitence for doubting the numbers

7679795 what if you were kidnapped by your neighbor and rescued by the president of the united states
7679796 why would the president come to the rescue of an ordinary citizen
7679797 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7679798 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7679799 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7679800 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7679801 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7679802 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7679803 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night

7679807 we gather this week in denver a city built during the booms of the old west but now part of a rocky mountain region that will be defined more by its future than by its past
7679808 from mining towns and cattle ranches to solar energy farms and technology empires denver continually evolved in this region that has seen so much so much change we gather here to say that we as a country need that change change is what happens when we all unite across party lines and regional boundaries between cities and suburbs
7679809 here in denver at the edge of the rocky mountains our mile high altitude encourages us to take the long view we can see that being pro business and pro environment go hand in hand we demand collaboration and common sense remember there were a lot more barn raisings than there were shoot outs in the old west
7679810 we believe that people should be defined by how hard they work and the results that they deliver that is why the new ideas and leadership of barack obama have electrified this region new ideas and leadership for america that appeal to our optimism our entrepreneurial spirit and our rugged individualism
7679811 we cannot afford four more years of the same failed policies and thats why we are here to nominate barack obama to lead us toward the change we need
7679812 it is no news to you that americans are watching our jobs disappear we are working harder earning less struggling to keep our homes paying higher prices for everything and fearing for the safety of our children who are fighting wars half a world away
7679813 it is no news to you that during these nearly eight years of clouded days and wary nights americas moral authority has been compromised her good will squandered and her safety made more uncertain than ever and yet we americans are determined we need a change
7679814 hes truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldnt miss it for anything in the world
7679815 ben has the ability to guard five guys on the court all five positions and sometimes he does it on one play
7679816 in america they know me as the guy who did faith
7679817 these young guys dont need some idiot to tell them they are rubbish
7679818 i say thank god there can be an area within music that is a little bit softer than the mainstream somewhere where young guys can develop their talents without being trounced
7679819 taking the best from the secular world but altering it to make it kosher
7679820 none of this clashes with our religion so long as we remember that being a singer is very well and good but it doesnt make you a star for us rabbis are the only real stars and we want it to stay that way
7679821 be careful what you wish for it just might happen
7679822 theyve gotta be one of the ten best teams ever dont they
7679823 if we play like that against the pistons well lose by 50
7679824 you could see in he cavs eyes they knew they couldnt stand up to the pistons from there on in
7679825 were like the vikings of old we come to your town and you better be ready were there to beat you up take your fans take your arena and then cut your heart out before we go
7679826 after we started 8 0 weve been expected to win every game
7679827 i heard that the pistons lost the game on purpose to make the series longer because they want more games and more revenue
7679828 if my dog does her business right here it wont stink as much as that logic
7679829 they look worn out after playing all these games the past three years also they dont go very deep in the bench and the starters have played a lot of minutes miami has too much for them
7679830 if a stranger walked in i could point over there and say by the way those guys in the wrinkled practice shorts and randomly colored practice jerseys see them over there thats the best basketball team in the world
7679831 chauncey deserved the mvp over kobe lebron and nash hes the leader of the best team in the league
7679832 im a 50 shooter so keep firing the makes are coming
7679833 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could and the fact that hes launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will
7679834 both guys i look at as starters both guys will help as special teams but it was nip and tuck
7679835 we took a quick look outside and didnt see a whole lot of traffic
7679836 they had security just on the other side of our apartments but nothing we had to go through to get back or anything so we decided just to go ahead and drive
7679837 at first it was certainly on my radar when we were thinking about how kids get here and if our busses were going to run
7679838 denver public schools its going to be business as usual
7679839 some of the indirect impact the convention may have with certain schools that are close to the downtown area primarily is going to be due to traffic congestion
7679840 weve been planning this for several months now and our bus drivers will make those decisions as they see fit
7679841 with the planning that we did in advance its paying off
7679842 i did think it was going to be a lot busier than that but it wasnt bad at all
7679843 i thought there was going be a lot of traffic on federal boulevard
7679844 i really thought a lot of streets were going to be blocked off
7679845 weve tried to encourage our parents to be sure to treat today as they would any other day
7679846 those schools that are close or throughout the federal boulevard corridor should expect the same type of traffic congestion than any other bronco game
7679847 we anticipate things will go smoothly on thursday as well
7679848 i would think the side streets are going to be crowded overall
7679849 thats probably definitely a day were going to ride our bikes over
7679850 your honor this is case number 262 on the matter of doohum vs the state of texas parties have been sworn in you may be seated
7679851 your honor ladies and gentleman of the jury this case is so exceedingly simple a five year old child could see that the defendant mr doohum is guilty of defrauding the harris county sheriffs office out of hundreds of thousands of dollars yours and my tax dollars to feed a lifestyle of debauchery drugs booze and women
7679852 this is a matter of such great importance that neither you nor i understand the greater implications of mr doohums endeavors i know by his personal testimony here today he will be exonerated of all charges thank you
7679853 mr doohum will you state for the record what you do
7679854 ive been allocating money from the department to uh fix past crimes
7679855 this is the ranting of a lunatic its a waste of the courts time
7679856 your honor in order to present my clients case he must be allowed to present his story
7679857 uh like i said i fix em by time travel
7679858 well its a sort of stupid but my showers a time machine
7679859 yeah i tore my acl so its hard getting out of a tub i aint never used the shower in my house before even though ive been living there for eight years so i had no choice see i got in and turned the knob from cold to hot when i was done showering i came out and dried but something wasnt right it was nine years earlier
7679860 i started thinking and got the idea yeah the idea that i could come back and prevent some crimes you know murders and such i got back in the shower and turned the knob from hot to cold and bingo bango back to the present i tried going back as early as i could but i can only go as far back as when the house was built
7679861 objection your honor this has no bearing on the embezzlement of funds
7679862 ill allow it but get your client to the point councilor
7679863 yes your honor mr doohum lets concentrate on the steak and not the peas
7679864 so you were renting a room in your own house
7679865 the sheriffs office figured they could pay my expenses seein how i was cleanin up past cases and all funny thing was when i get back to the present them files i took with me turned into blank sheets of paper
7679866 basically i was just bumpin off them fellas with a 45 oh nother thing i was also taking money for the time i spent on these cases a wage i guess
7679867 so no evidence exists in the present because you were in fact changing history
7679868 mrs mcginley what about her can she vouch for any of this
7679869 she could if she hadnt gone and died few years back
7679870 i aint been able to use it for two weeks now i called my brother in law cause hes the only plumber i trust but hes got a back log of three weeks cant get to it until the first of the month
7679871 well that is a fine story a fine story ignoring for the time being that there is absolutely no physical evidence of this ridiculous claim lets just concentrate on your purchase of hard liquor with county funds
7679872 yeah but i can tell you right and well that time travel does a number on ya i always kept five bottles jack daniels in the past at all times kept five bottles in the present i mustve gone through two to three a day you know just to sooth my nerves
7679873 mr doohum just how much are you rewarding yourself with wages as you put it and id like to here about this car
7679874 it werent nothin too much say 200 000 or so giver or take plus whatever it cost for a porsche
7679875 yeah sure i do i got all of them right here
7679876 look this is all fine fine youve done a hell of a job

7679888 fiscal irresponsibility and educationally unsound decision making both of which negatively impact the students and staff of the gladstone school district
7679889 we did the best that we could for the district and the community to keep a balanced budget and provide the best schooling for our kids and we felt that we did that well as well as we could
7679890 we have a lot of financial pressures as do many school districts in the up and weve done the best we could with limited financial resources

7679894 let us protect our newsrooms and encourage more and more journalists to become experts in the areas they are reporting from and give them more time to understand the cultures they are reporting from
7679895 it may sound odd but the humanity of the taliban because the taliban are a wide very diverse group of people
7679896 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7679897 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7679898 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7679899 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7679900 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7679901 its an initiative that belittles the role of nuns who have dedicated themselves to god
7679902 we dont have anything i cant see us being friends
7679903 i think youre a cool person but an ugly bitch
7679904 this will be worth a lot of money seeing as so many people wore it
7679905 i dont wanna get everything i want from fame and fortune
7679906 i wanna get it because i deserve it because ive been genuine
7679907 shut up dont come out with ridiculous statements like that of course you would

7679909 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
7679910 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
7679911 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
7679912 after working in the clinton administration in the department of commerce on internet privacy and online commerce issues hunter consulted for five years as an expert on these very same issues at a time of enormous expansion in online banking
7679913 he was not a lobbyist for mbna and his work had absolutely nothing to do with the bankruptcy bill zero nothing
7679914 took plenty of knocks from the largest employer in his state because he demanded changes
7679915 sen biden improved the bill for low income workers women and children there were times when he believed amendments on both sides would have blown up a bipartisan compromise backed by three quarters of the senate at those moments sen biden had to make the tough calls and he voted to pass a bill
7679916 the search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness
7679917 one cannot divine nor forecast the conditions that will make happiness one only stumbles upon them
7679918 we are never happy we can only remember that we were so once
7679919 ask yourself whether you are happy and you cease to be so
7679920 happiness is a mystery like religion and should never be rationalised
7679921 i have now spent fifty five years in resolving having from the earliest time almost that i can remember been forming schemes of a better life i have done nothing the need of doing therefore is pressing since the time of doing is short o god grant me to resolve aright and to keep my resolutions
7679922 there is no duty we so much underrate as the duty of being happy
7679923 martha martha thou art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful and mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her
7679924 imaginary evil is romantic and varied real evil is gloomy monotonous barren boring imaginary good is boring real good is always new marvelous intoxicating
7679925 what a wonderful life ive had i only wish id realized it sooner
7679926 it is easy to be heavy hard to be light
7679927 a mans first care should be to avoid the reproaches of his own heart
7679928 for the love of god and my sisters so charitable toward me i take care to appear happy and especially to be so
7679929 all severity that does not tend to increase good or prevent evil is idle
7679930 i must do the work that i am best suited for
7679931 guilty as hell free as a bird america is a great country
7679932 i was so sad leaving my carbondale friends but now its not bad at all
7679933 a pure service business is not particularly defensible some open source companies have not truly figured that out
7679934 the kernel is about pretty harsh technical issues and mistakes are really frowned upon
7679935 we believe we will have more than sufficient cash on hand at the closing to manage the integration process and run the day to day business
7679936 was of the belief that these sexual interactions would be a positive experience for her daughter and that richards would receive sexual gratification
7679937 there cant be good living where there is not good drinking
7679938 beer if drank with moderation softens the temper cheers the spirit and promotes health
7679939 we the brewers of avery brewing company in order to form a more perfect ale require a new leadership that can liberate us from our quagmires in foreign lands
7679940 is the healer keeping me topped up while im not doing something berserk that might just might make everything go pear shaped
7679941 greater love hath no man this that a man lay down his life for his friends
7679942 everyone hears what you say friends listen to what you say best friends listen to what you dont say
7679943 sure bouncing your two month old around the house for every sleeping occasion is easy now but imagine doing it with a sack of potatoes
7679944 he looks like a turtle every time he reaches his head out to take a bite
7679945 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7679946 hes very committed to helping working class folks and poor people and thats what catholic social teaching is all about
7679947 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7679948 im a practicing catholic and it is the biggest dilemma for me in terms of comporting my religious and cultural views with my political responsibility
7679949 the only means by which in this heterogeneous society of ours we can reach some general accommodation on what is a religiously charged and publicly charged debate
7679950 biden has opposed government funding for abortion so basically he doesnt want to put women and doctors in jail he doesnt want to criminalize abortions but nor does he want the government to pay for them
7679951 our catholic institutions will not honor catholic politicians who take pro abortion legislative positions
7679952 im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7679953 varia es inf mas podem alterar irreversivelmente o padr o dos acontecimentos
7679954 as pessoas temem a forma de pensamento original mais que qualquer outra coisa no mundo mais que a sua pr pria ru na mais que a pr pria morte
7679955 gaming as an art form is an ongoing discourse and one we enter into tentatively with violin hero a game that will see the parents of young talented actual violin players everywhere go apeshit like this game is worse than gta iv and the yorkshire ripper combined at least were hoping so because wed like the free publicity
7679956 too long next door not starting early enough being responsible
7679957 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7679958 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7679959 we are going to go forward with the players that we have
7679960 and we are always looking for and searching for people who can help our team and nothing is going to change with regard to that
7679961 i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7679962 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7679963 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7679964 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre
7679965 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7679966 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
7679967 he is another one of those infectious personalities so his personality and his mind state are always going to be at the utmost highest so i am not worried about him on that point
7679968 many times women are faced with job transitions as our family dynamics change and grow it was for these reasons i found myself simultaneously maintaining two work at home jobs
7679969 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7679970 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7679971 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7679972 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7679973 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7679974 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7679975 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7679976 look how long it takes the police or anybody else to get here
7679977 if someone wants to come here and harm someone at least we would have sort of defense
7679978 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
7679979 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7679980 joe biden is a great choice for american workers and labor
7679981 has long been the leading advocate of the harshest and most aggressive drug criminalization laws and general anti crime measures
7679982 how much of the 2008 democratic national convention do you plan on watching
7679983 the real issue for the next presidential term whats going to be cool to drive for the next four years
7679984 were thrilled that presidential candidates are talking about plug in hybrids
7679985 it shows weve reached a tipping point where our elected leaders ceos and grass roots advocates and automakers all agree it makes sense to power cars with cleaner cheaper domestic electricity
7679986 gt nawaz pulling the 2nd largest party majority from the ppp coalition
7679987 you said you wouldnt tell that it was our little secret
7679988 if you become president i will become more powerful than you could ever imagine
7679989 obviously platte avenue carries a lot of traffic if we were to lose more of this structure lose the sand that protects the abuttements we might have to look at shutting down platte avenue
7679990 codeine itself doesnt have any pain relieving effects but our body changes it into morphine and thats what combats the pain
7679991 the problem is that your genetic makeup makes more or less of it
7679992 so this is where the risk lies because you cant know in advance what that predisposition would be unless you would do a genetic test which is not standard routine at this point so while it would not be a problem in all cases i would say that codeine cannot be considered a safe drug for some mothers who are breast feeding their infants
7679993 the basic nature of this finding does not surprise me given that this is where science is going with a huge effort being made to better understand the interaction of ones genes with exposure to various substances and its not unheard of for this kind of science to lead to an altering of ob gyn practice it should be said for example that it wasnt so long ago in the 60s and 70s that women were actually given alcohol to stop premature labor so the possibility that this is true does create a burden to do the appropriate testing before we make such prescriptions
7679994 the way i saw him hitting last week in practice i think he wants to play real real bad
7679995 has done everything and he looks like the reed of old the doctors feel good reed feels good he seems to be very strong hes come a long long way in a short period of time its been good for him and its been good for him mentally hes ready to go
7679996 i like all coaches am very leery and scared of the opening game
7679997 we respect the villanova wildcats and coach andy talley they beat a big east team in 2002 and they had maryland 10 7 at the half last year andy has one of his best teams coming back
7679998 they have 17 starters and like 34 35 letterwinners returning
7679999 they were 7 4 and im a little jumpy about that
